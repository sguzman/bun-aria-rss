  "description": "<p>Too many people in the U.S., particularly those from communities of color, live in geographic areas that have little to no access to an affordable and adequate supply of healthy and fresh whole foods. Unequal access to quality food has ripple effects across health, performance in school, and ultimately, the ability to generate wealth. On this episode, we learn about how food industry professionals are working to eliminate food deserts across the country. First we hear from entrepreneur Cassandria Campbell, who co-founded Fresh Food Generation in Boston after moving back in her early 20s to find that her community continued to lack places to get a quick, healthy, delicious meal. Then, host Carla Harris speaks with Something Better Foods founder and CEO, Chef GW Chew, about scaling his plant-based food manufacturing business in order to make securing fresh food a reality for all people.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.morganstanley.com/what-we-do/inclusive-innovation-and-opportunity\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.morganstanley.com/what-we-do/inclusive-innovation-and-opportunity</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Disclaimer text</em></p><p><em>The guest speakers are neither employees nor affiliated with Morgan Stanley & Co.
