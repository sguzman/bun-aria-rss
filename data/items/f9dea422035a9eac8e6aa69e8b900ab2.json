  "description": "<p>We introduce a novel approach to reveal ordering fluctuations in sheared\ndense suspensions, using line scanning in a combined rheometer and laser\nscanning confocal microscope. We validate the technique with a moderately dense\nsuspension, observing modest shear-induced ordering and a nearly linear flow\nprofile. At high concentration ($\\phi = 0.55$) and applied stress just below\nshear thickening, we report ordering fluctuations with high temporal\nresolution, and directly measure a decrease in order with distance from the\nsuspension's bottom boundary as well as a direct correlation between order and\nparticle concentration. Higher applied stress produces shear thickening with\nlarge fluctuations in boundary stress which we find are accompanied by dramatic\nfluctuations in suspension flow speeds. The peak flow rates are independent of\ndistance from the suspension boundary, indicating that they likely arise from\ntransient jamming that creates solid-like aggregates of particles moving\ntogether, but only briefly because the high speed fluctuations are interspersed\nwith regions flowing much more slowly, suggesting that shear thickening\nsuspensions possess complex internal structural dynamics, even in relatively\nsimple geometries.\n</p>",
