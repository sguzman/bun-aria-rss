  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, everything President Biden is doing is undermining America and empowering the Democrat party with his neo-Marxist agenda. Biden and the Democrats reject federalism, individualism, and liberty. Democrats embrace monarchical fascism, authoritarianism, and central power. HR 1 is a perfect example of a power-grab of central authority. Democrats want nothing to do with Edmond Burke, Montesquieu, de Tocqueville, or Locke instead they worship Marx, Engels, and Bell. Also, the American media is not independent or righteous, they are propagandists dedicated to spreading tyranny in America. Then, Bernie Sanders says that 'extremist Republicans' are behind the movement to recall California Gov. Gavin Newsom. Afterward, Nancy Pelosi is the least popular politician in America according to an NRCC poll. \n\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
