  "description": "A recent article in the Atlantic echoed a discussion we had not too long on Deep State Radio about whether or not we are in a \"constitutional crisis.\"  The conclusion was we face \"rot\" not a crisis right now.  But is that worse than a crisis because it inures us to a problem without motivating us to confront and change it?  And is there something worse, an underlying cultural crisis that threaten our society in even more grievous ways?  Kori Schake, Rosa Brooks, Ed Luce and David Rothkopf discuss.
