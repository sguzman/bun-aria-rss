  "description": "<p>We are on vacation, so we decided now would be a good time to introduce you to Shane Waters' podcast Foul Play. Shane is an amazing investigative podcaster who brings some interesting true crime cases to the forefront. This is Part 1 of Season 8, which features Making a Predator and this is very personal. Our story begins with a man walking into a movie theater in Noblesville, Indiana – 22-year-old Brent Allred. Brent is shy, self-effacing, and a junior at nearby Ball State University. He’s meeting a woman here, or rather a girl, for the very first time. They’ve been talking for six months now, and today he’s wearing the appropriate amount of overpriced cologne, a button-down shirt, black leather shoes, and he’s holding a pair of movie tickets for the two of them that he bought in advance for this day.</p> <p>Make sure to check out the rest of this 4-part series!</p> <p>Foul Play can be found on all platforms: https://link.chtbl.com/foulplay</p>",
