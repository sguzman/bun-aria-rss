  "description": "<p>Taylor Swift has a list of stalkers longer than her stadium tour setlists. One drove over 900 miles to hand-deliver his “love” letters to her then-record-label, Big Machine Records. Others have showed up to her homes bearing rope, lock picks, and tools to break her windows. The threats on her life have become so persistent that her security team once installed facial recognition software at the venues she performed in, specifically to distinguish her stalkers from her fans. While making some of the most recognizable pop songs in music history, Taylor Swift also became one of the most recognizable women in the celebrity sphere – a title that on many occasions has nearly cost her life.</p><p><em>This episode contains themes that may be disturbing to some listeners, including descriptions of stalking and sexual assault.</em></p><p>To hear all episodes of Disgraceland for free, visit amazon.com/disgraceland.
