  "description": "Redefining the Modern Military: The Intersection of Profession and Ethics (Naval Institute Press, 2018), edited by Nathan K. Finney and Tyrell O. Mayfield, is a collection of essays examining military professionalism and ethics in light of major changes to modern warfare.  Contributors examine philosophical and legal questions about what constitutes a profession, the requirements of a military professional, and military education.  Additionally, the authors tackle questions of ethics related to new technological advancements, such as unmanned aircraft.  Finally, an interesting discussion of the military’s relationship with society, and vice versa, is discussed as an important component of oversight of the profession. Today I spoke with Finney and one of the contributors, Brian Laslie.\n\n\n\nBeth Windisch is a national security practitioner. You can tweet her @bethwindisch.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
