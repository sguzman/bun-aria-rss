  "description": "Addiction is something many of us have experienced, whether we ourselves have battled with addiction, guilt and shame, or we know a loved one, friend or family member who is dealing with addiction. According to the National Survey on Drug Use and Health (NSDUH), 19.7 million American adults (aged 12 and older) battled a substance use disorder in 2017 alone! When it comes to addiction, whether we are talking about addiction to drugs, alcohol, food, sex and so on, people are often faced with conflicting messages: they are damaged goods with little or no hope of overcoming their addiction, or it is all their fault and they are just “bad apples”.\nYet reality is far more complicated, and, thankfully, far more hopeful: it is possible to take responsibility for our lives while recognizing and dealing with the negative consequences addiction. In this week’s podcast I speak about addiction and how it is possible to overcome it with Adi Jaffe, Ph.D. who is a nationally recognized expert on mental health, addiction, relationships and shame. We discuss his unconventional but effective method, how he struggled with addiction (which ended up with him in prison!), how to help someone who is struggling with addiction, and why abstinence is ineffective in addiction recovery.\nFor more information on Dr. Adi and his courses, book, and podcast visit: https://www.adijaffe.com/bio \nFind him on Facebook, Instagram and Twitter: @dradijaffe\nIGNTD Hero Program: https://www.igntdrecovery.com/transforming-addiction-full \nGet his book The Abstinence Myth for free here: https://www.theabstinencemyth.com/ \nAdditional reading: https://www.cnn.com/2012/09/13/health/jaffe-addiction-myths/index.html\n \nAdditional resources:\nGet my new 21 day brain detox program here: https://theswitch.app\n \nVisit my website at www.drleaf.com for more resources, tips, and tools to help you improve and heal your mental health!
