  "description": "Gerald Seib wrote in a recent column in the Wall Street Journal that the greatest threat to American national security is our own divisions.  However, that isn't the only existential threat that the United States faces.  Russia and China are testing the United States's cyber defenses and Climate Changes continues to be a central focus as COP26 moves forward in Glasgow.  Can America have a strong foreign policy if there are such drastic changes between administrations?  How is the Biden administration pushing back against adversaries in cyberspace?  Are statements coming out of COP26 just \"blah blah blah\"? David Rothkopf discusses these and other issues with Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University, David Sanger of the New York Times, and Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute.
