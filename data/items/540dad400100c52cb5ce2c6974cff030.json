  "description": "Today I talked to the remarkable Fiona Hill about her new memoir There Is Nothing for You Here: Opportunity in an Age of Decline (Mariner Books, 2021). We talked about the decline of older coal and steel industries (and economic dislocation generally), how this decline relates to the rise of populism in the Russia and the West, and her decision to join the Trump administration as a national security advisor. She is insightful and interesting about all of it. Enjoy. \nMarshall Poe is the founder and editor of the New Books Network.
