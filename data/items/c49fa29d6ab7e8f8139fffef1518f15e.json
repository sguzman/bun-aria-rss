  "description": "<p>Oh boy. This will knock your socks off. The hurricane that is The Mooch whirls into London for this gripping, hilarious and heartfelt show. Packed full of incredible stories from inside the Trump White House and never-before-heard details about Steve Bannon, this is even better than you'd hope. It's a fantastic analysis of recent American politics, including how Trump appealed to blue collar America and why Anthony was initially attracted to the project. Anthony charts the deterioration of his relationship with Trump and his horror at some of the shocking moments in the last few years.
