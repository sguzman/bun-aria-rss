She and her little sister skipped off to bed together, but that would be the last time Sarah’s family got to see her. Sarah was kidnapped, assaulted and brutally murdered by a man <em>she knew</em>. Thomas Leggs was a convicted sexual offender, who had slipped through the cracks in the system time and time again, he should have been incarcerated at the time Sarah was taken, but somehow posted bond. Sarah’s death was not in vain though, Sarah’s law was passed and cracked down on these kinds of criminals. \n<br>\n\n<strong>If a you or a child you know has been the victim of sexual assault, here are some resources:</strong>\n<ul>\n<li>\n<strong>National sexual assault telephone hotline</strong>: Call 800.656.HOPE (4673) to be connected with a trained staff member from a sexual assault service provider in your area</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"https://www.childwelfare.gov/organizations/?CWIGFunctionsaction=rols:main.dspList&rolType=Custom&RS_ID=5\" target=\"_blank\">State Child Abuse and Neglect Reporting Numbers</a>\n</li>\n<li>\n<a href=\"http://virtualglobaltaskforce.com/\" target=\"_blank\">http://virtualglobaltaskforce.com/</a> </li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.childhelp.org/\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.childhelp.org/</a></li>\n</ul>\n<br>\n\nAs always, thank you to our sponsors:\n<br>\n\n\n<strong>Stamps</strong>: Just go to <a href=\"http://Stamps.com\" target=\"_blank\">Stamps.com</a>, click on the Microphone at the TOP of the homepage and type in MORBID.\n<br>\n\n\n<strong>Careof: </strong>For 50% off your first Care/of order, go to <a href=\"http://TakeCareOf.com/morbid50\" target=\"_blank\">TakeCareOf.com/morbid50</a> and enter code morbid50\n<br>\n\n\n<strong>Upstart: </strong>See why Upstart has over 6,000 5-star reviews on Trustpilot and hurry to <a href=\"http://Upstart.com/morbid\" target=\"_blank\">Upstart.com/morbid</a> to find out HOW LOW your Upstart rate can be\n\n<br>\n<strong>Amazon Music</strong>: Go to <a href=\"http://Amazon.com/morbid\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon.com/morbid</a> to get your first three months of Amazon Music, FREE\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
