  "description": "<p>Meditation: Vipassana (Mindfulness or Insight) - A gift of meditation is learning to open to life just how it is, with awake awareness. This meditation guides us in establishing an embodied presence, and collecting the attention with mindfulness of the breath. We then open the attention to whatever is predominant, and rest in an open, engaged and receptive presence.</p> <p>Your support enables us to continue to offer these talks freely.
