  "description": "The Billy Eichner comedy Bros was undeniably funny, but also a box office failure. Eichner blamed homophobia, but it’s more complicated, Mike argues, but also not terribly more complicated. Of course, depictions of gay sex—some tame, some raunchy—hurt box office. Plus, Michele Tafoya is back to discuss the topics that prompted her to leave Thursday Night Football for her Sideline Sanity podcast and an ambush interview with Dan Le Batard. And also, what drives the world’s biggest A-holes?\nProduced by Joel Patterson and Corey Wara\nEmail us at thegist@mikepesca.com\nTo advertise on the show, visit: https://advertisecast.com/TheGist\nLearn more about your ad choices.
