  "description": "Hey HBs, happy third week of hiatus! We're bringing one of our faves in the back catalogue. THE RED by Tiffany Reisz! It's an erotic fantasy novel about a fiery gallery owner who's in debt and on the brink of losing everything and the mysterious man who wants to help her save it... for a price. He's not interested in her soul, though, he wants her BODY. Yum! \n Bonus Content: Ember's newest skill, Erin's trip to IL, wedding dress shopping, a discussion on using the term \"whore\" in the most empowering and delicious way, reclaiming the word cunt, and the segments *Bing Boong Bong* \"safe sex work with Melody,\" \"do your fucking job with Melody,\" \"sex with mythical creatures with Erin,\" Melody's favorite alternate universe, and Erin's feelings on masquerade masks. Plus, MINOTAUR DONG. And does our podcast have a low-key new theme?\n Strap in and maybe strap on.
