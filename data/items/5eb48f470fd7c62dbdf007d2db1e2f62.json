  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the mask wars are driving people insane. But the mask issue should not be ideological, and does not need to be a battleground in the culture war. Today I hope to inject a little bit of basic common sense into the mask debate. Also Five Headlines including crazed Taylor Swift fans doxxing a music reviewer who didn’t like Swift’s album enough. And in our Daily Cancellation, I will preemptively cancel the false narrative around the latest video of a man dying in police custody.\n\nGet your copy of \"How to Destroy America in Three Easy Steps\" here: https://utm.io/uHjZ\n\nIf you like The Matt Walsh Show, become a member TODAY with promo code: WALSH and enjoy the exclusive benefits for 10% off at https://www.dailywire.com/walsh\nLearn more about your ad choices.
