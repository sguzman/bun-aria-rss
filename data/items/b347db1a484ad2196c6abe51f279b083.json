  "description": "Justin, Rob, and Wos are back from a well-earned break and thanking Ben Simmons and Klutch for creating some news during what is most often the slowest part of the NBA offseason. They discuss whether the recent report that Ben Simmons will refuse to appear at 76ers training camp has changed anything about the situation for Philadelphia or any of the teams vying to be his next destination (0:30). Then they break down what Zach LaVine signing with Klutch could mean for his tenure with the Bulls, whether he could be part of a trade package for Simmons, and whether Klutch's reputation as a signal for player movement is truly earned (13:30). They also take a look at the dispute between Nerlens Noel and Klutch and why Rich Paul gets such an unprecedented level of attention for an agent (28:45). Finally, they talk about Clint Capela’s extension with the Atlanta Hawks (40:00).\nHosts: Justin Verrier, Rob Mahoney, and Wosny Lambre\nAssociate Producer: Sasha Ashall\nLearn more about your ad choices.
