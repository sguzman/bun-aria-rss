  "description": "<p>We consider a kinetic description of a multi-species gas mixture modeled with\nBhatnagar-Gross-Krook (BGK) collision operators, in which the collision\nfrequency varies not only in time and space but also with the microscopic\nvelocity. In this model, the Maxwellians typically used in standard BGK\noperators are replaced by a generalization of such target functions, which are\ndefined by a variational procedure \\cite{<a href=\"/abs/2101.09047\">arXiv:2101.09047</a>}. In this paper we\npresent a numerical method for simulating this model, which uses an\nImplicit-Explicit (IMEX) scheme to minimize a certain potential function,\nmimicking the Lagrange functional that appears in the theoretical derivation.\nWe show that theoretical properties such as conservation of mass, total\nmomentum and total energy as well as positivity of the distribution functions\nare preserved by the numerical method, and illustrate its usefulness and\neffectiveness with numerical examples.\n</p>",
