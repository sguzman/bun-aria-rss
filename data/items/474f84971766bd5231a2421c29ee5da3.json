He has over 60 years of experience as a  renowned bat expert, educator and wildlife photographer. Merlin founded MTBC to teach the world understanding and appreciation of the contributions bats make to human beings and the world we share. \n\nThrough MTBC, Merlin provides an amazing bat photo gallery,  up-to-date resources (https://www.merlintuttle.org/resources/) and responses to grossly exaggerated disease speculation about bats.
