Wright wrote a paper about the Infosec Colour Wheel where she advocated for closing the gap between development teams (which she referred to as the yellow team) and security teams. Typically, the work that development and security teams do are siloed and due to different priorities, speed of execution is prioritised over other security concerns. In this episode, an incident responder will talk about the different work activities that the blue team does, how does one get to join the blue team side, and how the output of the yellow team profoundly impacts the blue team‚Äôs capabilities to protect and defend their environments.\n\nGyle dela Cruz (https://twitter.com/GyledC)\n\nGyle has tremendous respect for the work that developers do. Though she completed a degree in psychology and spent a few years in law school, she decided to shift to a career in tech after getting a lot of encouragement from a friend who was a developer. Her career has taken her around different countries which gave her exposure to different corporate cultures and practices. She received her Graduate Certificate in Incident Response from the SANS Institute and her Master in Cyber Security ‚Äì Digital Forensics from UNSW Canberra. In her day job, she works as an incident responder, helping her clients prepare for an incident and helping them respond to incidents. In her spare time, she does mentoring, volunteering, and presenting in different community-based infosec cons.\n\n‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨   üîó LINKS   ‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨\n\nOrange is the New Purple ‚ñ∫ https://www.blackhat.com/docs/us-17/wednesday/us-17-Wright-Orange-Is-The-New-Purple-wp.pdf\nNIST Cybersecurity Framework ‚ñ∫ https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework\nJourney to CSF 2.0  ‚ñ∫ https://www.nist.gov/cyberframework/updating-nist-cybersecurity-framework-journey-csf-20\nISO 8601  ‚ñ∫ https://www.iso.org/iso-8601-date-and-time-format.html\nRFC-3339  ‚ñ∫ https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc3339\n\n‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨ üé• Producer ‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨ \n\nMimi                        ‚ñ∫   https://twitter.com/p0kemina\n\n‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨   üéôÔ∏èHosts   ‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨ \n\nBec                           ‚ñ∫  https://twitter.com/errbufferoverfl\nJames                      ‚ñ∫  https://twitter.com/devec0\nLilly                          ‚ñ∫   https://twitter.com/attacus_au\nMimi                        ‚ñ∫   https://twitter.com/p0kemina\n\n‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨   üëã Connect with Us   ‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨‚ñ¨ \n\nTWITCH                              ‚ñ∫  https://www.twitch.tv/owasp_devslop\nDEV                                        ‚ñ∫  https://dev.to/devslop‚Äã \nINSTAGRAM                          ‚ñ∫  https://www.instagram.com/owaspdevslop/‚Äã\nTWITTER                               ‚ñ∫  https://twitter.com/owasp_devslop‚Äã",
