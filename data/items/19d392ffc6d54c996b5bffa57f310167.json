  "description": "The holidays are a time to gather your loved ones close with scary ghost stories to remember the past, look to the future, and reflect on the gift of the present. Time gives gifts in different forms. Often, they're material, other times they're wrapped in lessons, and sometimes they're spectral anomalies. First, we will be haunted by mysterious coins on Christmas. Next, in the holiday of now, a gorgeous woman receives an unexpected gift. Then, we look to the future where a voice cries out to the present. Finally, we’ll re-live a tragic past life during the Winter War.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
