The new clone is cloned from the previous week's clone, Multiplicity style. Surely, you've assumed as much. The strange characters. The shrill introduction. The clues have been on the proverbial bottom of the mug all along.\nThis week, we invited the 63rd member of the Frushtick bloodline to discuss Rogue Legacy. After the podcast, we repeated the weekly chore, locking the clone in a tank full of water and filing that tank into the back of a theater alongside its 62 brothers. This will be the last of Russ.\nJoin us next week when the original Russ Frushtick returns to the show for the first time since episode one!\n<p>2:20 - Best family tree in gaming (Rogue Legacy)<br />\n14:40 - Best turning point of the week (The Last of Us)<br />\n30:00 - Halftime!<br />\n35:20 - Best way to play a stealth game (Dishonored, Deus Ex: Human Revolution)<br />\n42:00 - Best anniversary of the week (App Store's 5th anniversary)<br />\n49:00 - The winner is ...</p>\n<p>Theme song by Ian Dorsch<br />\nGet the show:</p>\n<p>Download MP3\"<br />\nSubscribe to the podcast (RSS)<br />\nSubscribe on iTunes</p></p>\n",
