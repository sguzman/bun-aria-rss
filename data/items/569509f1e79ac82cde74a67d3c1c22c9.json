  "description": "<p>Meditation: Letting Go…Letting Be (2019-01-09) - This guided meditation invites us to imagine a clenched fist relaxing open, and explores this in releasing contractions in the body as well as the grip of thoughts. When we deeply let go and let be, our energy flows freely. We reconnect with our natural aliveness, love and awareness.</p> <p>Let go of what has passed.<br /> Let go of what may come.<br /> Let go of what is happening now.<br /> Don’t try to figure anything out.<br /> Don’t try to make anything happen.<br /> Relax, right now, and rest.</p> <p>~ Tilopa</p>",
