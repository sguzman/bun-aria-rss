  "description": "Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the violent protests in China on 4th May 1919 over the nation's humiliation in the Versailles Treaty after World War One.  China had supported the Allies, sending workers to dig trenches, and expected to regain the German colonies on its territory, but the Allies and China's leaders chose to give that land to Japan instead.  To protestors, this was a travesty and reflected much that was wrong with China, with its corrupt leaders, division by warlords, weakness before Imperial Europe and outdated ideas and values.  The movement around 4th May has since been seen as a watershed in China’s development in the 20th century, not least as some of those connected with the movement went on to found the Communist Party of China a few years later.\n\nThe image above is of students from Peking University marching with banners during the May Fourth demonstrations in 1919.\n\nWith \n\nRana Mitter\nProfessor of the History and Politics of Modern China and Fellow of St Cross College, University of Oxford\n\nElisabeth Forster\nLecturer in Chinese History at the University of Southampton\n\nAnd \n\nSong-Chuan Chen\nAssociate Professor in History at the University of Warwick\n\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson",
