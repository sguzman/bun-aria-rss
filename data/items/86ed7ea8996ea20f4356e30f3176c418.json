  "description": "BlackRock, the world’s largest asset manager, is partnering with Coinbase to offer crypto to its clients. Daniel and I discuss why this is huge for the crypto space… and why every investor should have exposure to crypto—even during this brutal bear market. We also highlight when we expect the U.S. government to clarify crypto regulations. Samsung recently warned investors that semiconductor demand will drop in the second half of 2022. I break down this grim economic warning… and the similar signals we’re seeing from other corners of the economy.  Finally, Daniel shares a “boring” company that rewards shareholders through any economic conditions… and I share my favorite play on end-of-summer entertainment. In this episode   You need crypto exposure—now [2:20] What BlackRock’s announcement means for the crypto space [4:30) Why asset managers are changing their tune on crypto [11:00] When can we expect U.S. crypto regulations?
