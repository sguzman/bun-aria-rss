The 456-page CBA was released to the public on Thursday and at least 2 Superfriends managed to read most of it (19:30). What are the most 'interesting' points in the document? We attempt to simply things for you. And finally, a trade took place with the Chargers receiving Trai Turner and the Panthers getting Russell Okung (49:30). Who came out on top of this deal?
