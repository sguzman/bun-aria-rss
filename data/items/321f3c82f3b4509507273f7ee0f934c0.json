  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We welcome back friend of the pod (and former Obama Deputy Chief of Staff), Alyssa Mastromonaco to answer our burning questions about this presidential election. Alyssa explains what happens to donations when a candidate drops out of the race, endorsements, and where you can go to find out more about the local politics that you can have a direct effect on. She also touches on Amy Klobuchar, Elizabeth Warren, Mike Bloomberg, and why we need to keep an eye on how the candidates spend their money (like during the Superbowl). She also explains how the caucus system works (it’s kind of crazy!) and why local politics are so important if you want to enact real change.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>More Alyssa:</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twitter:</span> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/alyssamastro44/media\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">@alyssamastro44</span></a></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instagram:</span> <a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/mastro175/?hl=en\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">@mastro175</span></a></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Podcast:</span> <a href= \"https://crooked.com/podcast-series/hysteria/\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Hysteria</span></a></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Alyssa’s Books:</strong></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href= \"https://www.amazon.com/Who-Thought-This-Good-Idea/dp/1455588229\"><em> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Who Thought This Was a Good Idea?</span></em></a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href= \"https://www.amazon.com/So-Heres-Thing-Growing-Trusting-ebook/dp/B07FSGS9XY\"> <em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">So Here's the Thing . . .: Notes on Growing Up, Getting Older, and Trusting Your Gut</span></em></a></li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><strong>Alyssa Recs:</strong></p> <p><a href=\"https://votesaveamerica.com/\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Vote Save America</span></a></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p> <p><strong>About Bad on Politics:</strong> <span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Bad on Politics is a monthly bonus episode where we invite a guest expert to help us break down a political topic.
