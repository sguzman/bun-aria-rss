  "description": "<p>Rep. Jamie Raskin of Maryland has been one of the most prominent voices in Congress speaking about Jan. 6 and the aftermath of the insurrection. He has a uniquely personal relationship with the violence that day: he lost his son shortly before the riot, and went on to serve both as an impeachment manager prosecuting the second impeachment of Donald Trump, and as a member of the House select committee on Jan. 6, on which he still sits.&nbsp;</p><p>On February 15, the Brookings Institution <a href=\"https://www.brookings.edu/events/the-future-of-american-democracy-a-conversation-with-congressman-jamie-raskin/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">welcomed Representative Raskin</a> to discuss his new book, “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Unthinkable-Trauma-Trials-American-Democracy/dp/0063209780\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Unthinkable: Trauma, Truth, and the Trials of American Democracy</a>.” For this special episode of the<em> Lawfare Podcast</em>, we’re bringing you audio of the event.
