  "description": "<p>\"People really want to deal with the present, but it's just extremely difficult to get a grasp of where we are now,\" says Gregor Muir, Tate's Director of Collection, International Art.</p> <p>Grappling with issues of how to think internationally during a period of increasing nationalism, Muir talks about how (and where) he is looking to discover great art. This broad-ranging conversation covers topics ranging from the technological revolution to Muir's own experiences moving between commercial galleries and museums; from changes in film and video art practice to the shifting dynamic between private and public art worlds.</p> <p>\"In Other Words\" is a presentation of AAP and Sotheby's, produced by Audiation.fm.</p> <p>For a full transcript, click here: http://www.artagencypartners.com/episode-14-transcript-gregor-muir/</p>",
