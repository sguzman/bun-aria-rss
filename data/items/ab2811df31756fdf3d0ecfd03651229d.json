  "description": "If there is a theme for this episode, it's sometimes you just need a clear sign that things are broken. Like, say, you're Oregon State and your head coach just bails on a ton of money out of the blue. Or you're an NFL position coach sending romantic cocaine videos from work. Or you're a home underdog to UVA. There's also a lot of talk about Butch Jones and Laserdisc and Spencer's weird body and rats, so it's fine if you choose not to listen.
