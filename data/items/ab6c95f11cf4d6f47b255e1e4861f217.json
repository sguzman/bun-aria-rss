  "description": "<p>The week on The Cigar Authority broadcasting live from the Toscano Sound Stage in Salem, New Hampshire… Dave has been working on cigar blends for years, and today we bring you into the process. What goes into making a blend, what are the basics and what does it really come down too? We will dig into the details and pull back the curtain.</p>\n<p>This week we mix things up a little bit and smoke two cigars side by side. In the care package were two cigars without a band. One measured 6 x 48, and one was 5 x 52. We invite care package members to do the same and smoke through the process with us…</p>\n<p>Join us for all of this and the usual suspects including the VS Question of the Week, Offer of the Day, Cigar News, The email of the week and a peek into the Asylum. The Cigar Authority is a member of the United Podcast Network and is recorded live in front of a studio audience at Studio 21 Podcast Cafe upstairs at Two Guys Smoke Shop in Salem, NH.</p>\n<p>As always you can find many of the cigars we smoke at <a href='https://www.2guyscigars.com/'>https://www.2guyscigars.com</a>.</p>\n<p>Never miss an episode by subscribing to the show via <a href='http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-cigar-authority/id413869893?mt=2&ign-mpt=uo%3D4'>Apple Podcasts</a> and <a href='http://thecigarauthority.podbean.com/'>Podbean</a>.</p>\n",
