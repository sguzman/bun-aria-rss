  "description": "<p><strong>This episode is for all you ordinary people out there. This week, Connor and Dan discuss the philosophical methodology known as Ordinary Language Philosophy. This was a loosely head together school of thought that prioritized focus on ordinary language in philosophy and claimed the best way to understand metaphysical concepts was to understand the way they were used in language. Talk about a snooze! Also, Connor rants a bit about people who go to music festivals (even though he just went to one) and you get a little peak into the writer's room for the next Minions movie. All in all, it's an episode.</strong></p>",
