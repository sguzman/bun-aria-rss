We’ll find out how it helps plants grow and learn about all the little organisms that are invaluable in the process (hint: it involves something called the “poop loop”).  Plus: A brand new Moment of Um answers the question: “What’s inside of a tooth?”  Today’s episode is sponsored by the CBC podcast Tai Asks Why and Quip (getquip.com/brainson).
