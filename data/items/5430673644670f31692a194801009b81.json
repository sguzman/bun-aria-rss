  "description": "<p><p>Donald Trump has requested the U.S. military put on a parade showcasing our strength, and Chaps and Cons break down why that's actually a terrible idea. Chaps interviews Josh Schaefer, a member of the Israeli Defense Force. Chaps asks him about the process of joining the IDF, the international reputation of the U.S. military, and more. We also salute a notable African American Air Force member for Black History Month, and give an update on ZeeBee, one of the service dogs the stoolies helped raised money for!Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
