  "description": "<p>On today's episode, Jason kicks things with a few thoughts on his recently deceased Survivor Pool entry. Justin Herbert and the Los Angeles Chargers laid an egg against the Houston Texans, costing our fearless leader a chance at over $80,000 in winnings. It's a tough pill to swallow, for sure, but these Chargers have been the model of inconsistency for most of the season so we probably shouldn't be too surprised. On the flip side, shout out to Dak Prescott and the Dallas Cowboys for blowing the doors off the Washington Football Team right out of the gates. Not only did it allow the gamblers to watch the second half stress-free knowing that the cover was in the bag, but it allowed all the East Coast football fans to hit the hay at a reasonable hour. With the Tampa Bay Buccaneers so banged up and Matthew Stafford reverting back to 'Lions Stafford' on Sunday, the Cowboys have a strong case for being the 2nd best team in the NFC behind the Green Bay Packers. On the coaching front, we've known for a while that that the Russell Wilson-Pete Carroll pairing was destined for a divorce at the end of this season (and Sunday's inexplicable loss to Nick Foles and the Chicago Bears only cemented that fact), but is it time for Steelers ownership to reconsider Mike Tomlin's future in Pittsburgh? The Steelers have been historically bad in the first halves of games the entire season - and that speaks directly to Tomlin's lack of preparation. On Sunday, Pittsburgh fell into a 23-0 first half hole against the Kansas City Chiefs on their way to a 36-10 blowout loss. Yikes. Finally, Jason closes the show with a Monday Night Football New Orleans Saints vs Miami Dolphins edition of the Best Bet.</p><p>Click <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/straight-fire-with-jason-mcintyre/id1523353907\">here</a> to subscribe, rate and review all of the latest Straight Fire with Jason McIntyre podcasts!</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
