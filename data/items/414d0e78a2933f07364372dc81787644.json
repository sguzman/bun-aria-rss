  "description": "<p>This week we’re breaking down “Viewing Party.” Gabe and Erin host a “Glee” viewing party at their home and Michael can’t help but wreck the party due to his disdain of Gabe. Meanwhile, Pam discovers Dwight is the answer to help regulate Cece’s sleeping cycle. We learn the interior of Gabe’s apartment was built on the warehouse set, Angela uncovers what Stanley would rather be doing than attend Erin and Gabe’s viewing party and Jenna shares how surprisingly easy it was to shoot the scene where Dwight instantly calms Cece.
