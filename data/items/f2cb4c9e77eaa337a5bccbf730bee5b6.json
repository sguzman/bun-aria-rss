  "itunes:summary": "Jim Galloway, the longtime political columnist for the Atlanta Journal-Constitution, sets up the two Georgia Senate runoff elections scheduled for Jan. 5th.  Because neither of the two Republican senators &#8212; David Perdue and Kelly Loeffler (appointed to the seat and running in a special election) &#8212; managed to break the 50 percent threshold, they and their respective Democratic challengers, Jon Ossoff and Rafael Warnock, will square off with control of the Senate at stake.  The Democrats must win BOTH seats on 1/5 for them to take control; it would put the Senate at 50-50, with Vice President Kamala Harris holding the tie-breaking vote.  If the GOP wins one of the races, Mitch McConnell will continue as the Senate majority leader, and make life miserable for Joe Biden.<br />",
