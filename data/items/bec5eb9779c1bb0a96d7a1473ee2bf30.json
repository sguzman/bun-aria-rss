  "description": "<p>Probably! We all are to some extent... After all, it's not unusual to enjoy it when other people like our work. However there are times it can become a problem and block you from moving forward.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We discuss times when we have been guilty of making work with too much consideration for what other people may think of it and have some ideas about how to spot when this may be having a detrimental impact on your own work. It's a fine line sometimes between caring too much and thinking \"f*ck it\" with pure abandon, so perhaps it's about honing your own personal criteria. After all - YOU are the artist.&nbsp;<br>\n<br>\nHopefully this conversation will help if you are ready to release yourself from other people's ideas and get closer to your own vision.
