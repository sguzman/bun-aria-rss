  "description": "<p>EPISODE 82 - JEFF NICHOLS, ADAM STONE - Director/Cinematographer Team</p> <p>Team Deakins has a great conversation with the collaborative team of director Jeff Nichols and cinematographer Adam Stone (MUD, LOVING, TAKE SHELTER). We learn about how they found each other, how they work together, and how that collaboration has grown over the years. They share their preference for shot lists over storyboards and their specificity when choosing locations (and how they drive the location department crazy!). Jeff, who also writes his projects, speaks of not adding camera direction in his scripts. We also talk about the difference in shooting for television and features and the different opportunities found in long-form storytelling. A great look at a close collaboration!</p>",
