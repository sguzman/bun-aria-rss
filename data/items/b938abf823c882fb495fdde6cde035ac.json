  "description": "<p>Boy, this chat was a treat. Vince Averill is the vocalist for <a href=\"https://crosscontrol-la.bandcamp.com\">Cross Control</a> and one of the co-hosts of <a href=\"https://wewatchwrestlingpodcast.com\">We Watch Wrestling Podcast</a> but his roots in punk/hardcore go deep with him putting out the first Grade 7\" as well as the classic <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6JwxZOtuUR4\">Ottawa/Jihad</a> split 12\" (a classic in my book). I found out this info all in short order so I had to have him on the show. We go deep on Detroit hardcore, DIY worlds colliding and the world of stand up comedy. Have fun!</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
