  "description": "<p>We’re kicking it Old School style with a Skype show with PFT in Atlantic City and Big Cat in Detroit. Rob Manfred tries a redo press conference and Lebron now has logged on with his thoughts. (2:45-18:15) Hot Seat/Cool Throne with Mark Richt’s hot dogs and A crazy Daytona finish. (18:45-28:49) Jason Biggs joins the show to reminisce about American Pie, what he’s doing now, and how he was one of the first people to be cancelled on twitter. (29:15-1:00:31) We do a rare dual interview with Aaron Donald and DK Metcalf at the same time and it was weird and funny and different. (1:02:06-1:23:12) We finish up with guys on chicks and bachelor talk (1:25:14-1:33:05)</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
