  "description": "As a way to say thank for voting for Myths and Legends for the Webbys (and for being the reason why we won!), we wanted to share an additional story this week. It's from the southern United States, and it was originally an episode on the Myths and Legends member feed. It's a story of two wives in a stupidity arms race over who has the worse husband. The creature is the reason why the owl is such a shady bird that never comes out during the day. Thanks again for your vote. If you liked this episode and want more like it, there are now 31+ other episodes on the member feed. Go to support.mythpodcast.com for more info.
