  "description": "The first completely competitive and interesting weekend of the college football season gets...well, it gets us starting off by talking about a man dying a horrible death in a New York utility tunnel.\nThere is actual football. Points covered include:\n-- \"We gotta shit on Texas, Spencer. Because there is a fresh reason to shit on Texas.\"\n-- A proposal about Auburn struggling being a sign they will inevitably end up in the national title game\n-- How Houston Nutt is orbiting the earth like Felix Baumgartner waiting for that call from a willing school as a signal to drop in and save Arkansas\n-- More petty swipes at Will Muschamp (cut and paste from every week)\n-- A painful recounting of the times each of us watched a game that left us so angry we wept blood (except for Jason, who is the Dr. Manhattan of college football)\n-- Proposed: a campus full of yellow jackets would actually be a deeply uncomfortable place, and a campus of Brutus Buckeyes would be pretty much the same as Ohio State's campus right now\n-- Why BYU is dirty as hell (and that's just fine)\n-- Proposed: sponsoring a Shutdown Fullcast bowl game\nLearn more about your ad choices.
