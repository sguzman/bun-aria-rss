  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, tens of thousands of migrant children continue to be placed in tents due to overfilled detention facilities. President Biden just keeps moving them to disguise the anarchy at the Southern border. Professors and scholars with a voice in Biden's administration are driving Marxist policies and ideas like internal colonialism. They claim that Americans and their leaders ignore history and are illegitimate because it's the migrants that are true inhabitants of this land, not citizens. This current illegal immigration surge is a push to change the US demographic to match the left's current Critical Race Theory propaganda.\" Then, Mara Gay from the NY Times Editorial Board spouts off that the GOP is only \"animated\" by Trumpism and \"xenophobia.\" Gay neglected to address the inflammatory propaganda that her paper has published. Later, Democrats have created a schism that takes away jobs from American workers (including union workers), massive tax increases, and Americanized Marxism, and it's called the American Jobs Plan.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
