  "description": "<p>This week on <em>Eat Your Words</em>, host Cathy Erway is talking with author Janna Gur about her new recipe book, “Jewish Soul Food.” Just in time for upcoming holidays, Cathy kicks off the show asking Janna why she decided to take on writing this book. She elaborates that she wanted to bring the ‘greatest hits’ of Jewish grandmothers to North American readers. Considering herself more of a curator of wonderful recipes at her disposal, she explains that she nearly prefers that title to cookbook author because the included recipes have been tried again and again and are not solely based on her personal tastes. Janna currently lives in Tel Aviv, Israel and sheds light on the environment there from the political turmoil to the cultural and culinary highlights. Tune in to hear all about the new book as well as the definition and differences between Ashkenazi and Sephardic cooking.
