  "title": "PMS 2.0 198 - Bruce Arians, Chris Harris Jr., Billy Napier, & Legend, AJ Hawk Stop By For A FANTASTIC Friday. Be A Friend, Tell A Friend",
  "description": "Today's show is highlighted by a couple of incredible interviews. First, friend of the show, and current Head Coach of the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Bruce Arians joins the show. Pat and Bruce chat about the state of his golf game currently, how it was actually Tom Brady's idea to bring Gronk to Tampa Bay, at what point Bruce realized that getting Tom Brady was a real possibility, and whether or not he's worried Jameis knows his playbook now that he is a member of the Saints (2:14-18:43). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk where Pat and AJ discuss the importance of the schedule release, and what players are typically looking at when they first see it. They also cover Earl Thomas' nightmare of a situation with his wife, and chat about Andy Dalton not being able to do any press because he doesn't want to piss off anyone for the Cowboys, plus much more (20:57-1:25:46). Next, reigning Sun Belt Conference Coach of the Year, Head Coach of the Louisiana Lafayette Ragin' Cajuns, Billy Napier joins the show. Pat and Billy chat about what it was like working on the staffs of both Dabo Swinney and Nick Saban and what he has taken from those programs into his own, how teams are trying to stop the current offenses that are taking flight in college football, and how he competes with bigger schools when it comes to recruiting (1:25:48-1:40:20). Lastly, Super Bowl Champion, 4x Pro Bowler, 3x All-Pro, and new member of the Los Angeles Chargers, Chris Harris Jr. joins Pat and the boys. They discuss the story of the Broncos suggesting he fire his agent during the season, why he landed on the Chargers and what is appealing to him, and how the competitiveness between cornerbacks and safeties has changed since he was first in the league (1:40:22-1:50:32). Don't forget to send in the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat with a picture of where you're listening to the show for the chance to win some merch. Stay safe this weekend. Come and laugh with us, cheers.\n",
