  "description": "<p>Alton, Illinois' position along the great Mississippi River made it a good place to stay and when mineral springs were discovered under the spot where the Mineral Springs Hotel now sits, it became a place to stay for relaxation and the curative powers of the water. This was a grand hotel that has faded and now houses shops and possibly spirits. This is said to be one of the most haunted locations in Alton and on this episode we share its stories as we venture into every nook and cranny from the dug out spaces underneath the building to the empty pool room and beyond. Join us on our investigation into the Mineral Springs Hotel!
