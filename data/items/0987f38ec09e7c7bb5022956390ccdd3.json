Their video “The Great Reanimation” uses as its subject the chimera, a fantastical creature artificially created by combining parts of different specimens, either in drawings or taxidermy, which were ubiquitous in early natural history exhibitions Inspired by the ancient fables that would feature non-human creatures to broach difficult topics concerning people’s relationship with authority, and touching upon questions of antispecism, equality, and the legacy of colonialism, their story narrates a dystopian scenario in which the chimeras have come to life and are demanding fair compensation for the decades they spent on display for the entertainment of humans. In the episode, Christin, Bassem and Ameneh touch discuss the history of the natural history museum and its deceptively innocent origins in cabinets of curiosity collected by scientists and explorers during the early period of Western colonial expansion.
