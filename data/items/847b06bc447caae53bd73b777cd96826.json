  "description": "<p>Quantum tunneling sensors are typically ultra-sensitive devices which have\nbeen specifically designed to convert a stimulus into an electronic signal\nusing the wondrous principles of quantum mechanical tunneling. In the early\n1990s, William Kaiser developed one of the first micromachined quantum\ntunneling sensors as part of his work with the Nasa Jet Propulsion Laboratory.\nSince then, there have been scattered attempts at utilizing this phenomenon for\nthe development of a variety of physical and chemical sensors. Although these\ndevices demonstrate unique characteristics such as high sensitivity, the\nprinciple of quantum tunneling often acts as a double-edged sword and is\nresponsible for certain drawbacks of this sensor family. In this review, we\nbriefly explain the underlying working principles of quantum tunneling and how\nthey are used to design miniaturized quantum tunneling sensors. We then proceed\nto describe an overview of the various attempts at developing such sensors.\nNext, we discuss their current need and recent resurgence. Finally, we describe\nvarious advantages and shortcomings of these sensors and end this review with\nan insight into the potential of this technology and prospects.\n</p>",
