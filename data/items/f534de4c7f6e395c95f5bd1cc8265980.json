  "description": "<p>This week I’m joined by attorney and activist Elizabeth Beavers, who has just written a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://fellowtravelersblog.com/2021/06/28/ilhan-omar-was-right-the-ugly-reality-of-international-justice/\">piece</a> for <em>Fellow Travelers</em> titled “Ilhan Omar was Right: The Ugly Reality of International ‘Justice’” that delves into the sordid relationship the United States has had with the International Criminal Court and really with the very concept of accountability for war crimes. We’ll talk about what she aptly calls “global justice apartheid,” unpack the frequently made claim that the domestic US legal system is capable of adjudicating American war crimes, and ask whether there’s any way to subject the US to to the same standards of international accountability that Washington demands of every other nation.
