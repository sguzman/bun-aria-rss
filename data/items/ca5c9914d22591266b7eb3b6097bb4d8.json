  "description": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are quickly approaching our one-year anniversary since we started this podcast. For this week, I decided to revisit an old episode. Carla Rockmore is a fashion stylist and designer whose recent rise on social media only underscores her decades of experience with fashion. She gives great actionable tips that we can incorporate into our lives to elevate our style. It doesn't matter what your aesthetic is, there's a way to elevate it. By the time we reached out to her, she had a couple of 100,000 followers on social media. Now, she has over a million followers. She was just featured in The New York Times, and Vogue called her the next Carrie Bradshaw. So I hope you enjoy either rewatching or checking it out for the very first time.</span>",
