  "description": "<p>On this episode of Battles & Banter, Avery, Codie & Tony discuss one of the most dramatic events of the Second World War: the \"Miracle at Dunkirk\". Taking place between May 26-June 4, 1940, the evacuation of the British Expeditionary Force from the European mainland (codenamed Operation Dynamo) was one of the most successful military undertakings in world history. However, it came on grim tidings as France began to fall to Nazi Germany at the same time. By July 1940, Great Britain would stand alone against the Axis Powers. The guys discuss the significance of Dunkirk, while also comparing it to Christopher Nolan's 2017 film of the same name. Also, Tony possibly gets abducted by Harry Styles of One Direction, Codie sings a song that Jonathan Groff would either love or hate, and Avery effectively butchers various European accents with the help of IPAs. Enjoy!</p>",
