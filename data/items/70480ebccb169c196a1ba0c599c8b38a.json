  "description": "<p>Filter pruning is a common method to achieve model compression and\nacceleration in deep neural networks (DNNs).Some research regarded filter\npruning as a combinatorial optimization problem and thus used evolutionary\nalgorithms (EA) to prune filters of DNNs. However, it is difficult to find a\nsatisfactory compromise solution in a reasonable time due to the complexity of\nsolution space searching. To solve this problem, we first formulate a\nmulti-objective optimization problem based on a sub-network of the full model\nand propose a Sub-network Multiobjective Evolutionary Algorithm (SMOEA) for\nfilter pruning. By progressively pruning the convolutional layers in groups,\nSMOEA can obtain a lightweight pruned result with better\nperformance.Experiments on VGG-14 model for CIFAR-10 verify the effectiveness\nof the proposed SMOEA. Specifically, the accuracy of the pruned model with\n16.56% parameters decreases by 0.28% only, which is better than the widely used\npopular filter pruning criteria.\n</p>",
