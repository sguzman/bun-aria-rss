  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, JD Vance wants to be a Senator in Ohio with no record, he's running on Trump's record, and he didn't even vote for Trump in 2016. Vance opposed the Tea Party movement. Conversely, Josh Mandel was an early supporter of the Tea Party, beat the RINO establishment, and got elected statewide. What has Vance ever done for the conservative movement? Billionaire Peter Thiel wants to buy a U.S Senate seat and Vance is his guy to do it. Don't allow endorsements to sway you, look at each candidate and you'll see that Josh Mandel is the best candidate for Ohio. A fair primary is welcomed but lying and bullying should never be tolerated. Then, Putin is threatening America again and President Biden is silent. These are the times when we need a President like Trump or Reagan that will guarantee mutually assured destruction if Putin keeps it up. Unlike Rand Paul or JD Vance, Trump is a rational, prudential leader that knows when to use the military to protect America instead of romanticizing Putin. Later, pretend-journalist Jonathan Swan falsely claimed that this program's host was a never-Trumper. This mischaracterization was disproved several times and the archives are available for all to listen to. Afterward, Brad Anderson, former CEO of Best Buy and Executive Chairman of the Board at Job Creators Network joins the show to explain why corporations need to focus on their bottom line and serving customers not disagreements over social policy. Anderson added that this 'wokeness' phenomenon is led by executives that inherit established businesses, not the executives that created the business working hard to earn each customer's business. Businesses will remain healthy as long as companies embrace all and alienate none.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
