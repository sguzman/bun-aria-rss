  "description": "<div>August 11th, 2012 was a murky night for many in the town of Steubenville, Ohio as local high school students scattered themselves among a handful of parties that took a turn for the worse. A 16-yr-old girl – who would come to be known as Jane Doe – was repeatedly sexually assaulted at the hands of football players and bystanders alike, and it would take an outsider to follow the digital footprints and piece together that night as well as the wider web of rape culture in the town’s social hierarchy.
