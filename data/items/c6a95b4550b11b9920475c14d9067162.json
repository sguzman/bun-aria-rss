  "itunes:summary": "Folk, Noise, Electronics, Improvisation – how can radical music help us manifest new possibilities for thinking and imagine new ways of organising community through ritual behaviours, actions and languages?\n\nEva Birch talks through her shift into sound poetry; the parallel influences of Dada and psychoanalysis on her practice; and reflects on her recent performance with J, at The Oratory, Abbotsford Convent for Liquid Architecture’s Ritual Community Music series.\n\nEva Birch is a poet living in Melbourne on Woiwurrung country. She has published her work in Cordite Poetry Review, Sick Leave, and Un. Magazine, among others, and is the author of three chapbooks: Megalodon (SoD press, 2019), We Eat Out Together: My Heart Cam (WEOT collective, 2020), and Sun’s Window (Eva Birch and Kieren Seymour, 2021). For this performance she collaborated with J, a dj, musician and founder of the record label and publishing platform daisart.\n\nhttps://liquidarchitecture.org.au/events/adam-golebiewski-eva-birch-with-j-alexandra-spence\n\nRitual Community Music\n24 July 2022\nThe Oratory, Abbotsford Convent\nPresented by Abbotsford Convent and Liquid Architecture\n\nProduced by Mara Schwerdtfeger. \n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/liquidarchitecture\n\nFinancial support from patrons at any level has a resounding impact on our work.
