  "description": "<p>In this 90th in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens.<br/><br/>In this episode, we discuss our essay, “On Driving SARS-CoV2 Extinct: Why We Need a Multi-Pronged Approach.” We discuss some of the misinformation that is circulating about…all of this. We then discuss sex and gender: beginning with an excerpt from chapter 7 of A Hunter-Gatherer’s Guide to the 21st Century—Sex and Gender—we discuss the division of labor, the effect of agriculture on gender roles, what sex and gender are, and whether it’s manly to weave. Finally, we discuss a few current events that are pertinent: the eradication of “male” and “female” from medical school curricula; the welcoming of transwomen to compete as and against women in the Olympics; and a short excerpt from Helen Joyce’s new book, Trans. No, we’re not transphobic, but we do see transactivism as a destructive force that is good for nearly nobody—including those rare people who are truly trans.<br/><br/>Get your Goliath shirts right here: store.darkhorsepodcast.org<br/><br/>Support the sponsors of this show:<br/><br/>Public Goods: Get $15 off your first order at Public Goods, your new everything store, at https://www.publicgoods.com/darkhorse or with code DARKHORSE at checkout.<br/><br/>OMAX CryoFreeze: Pain is necessary and adaptive, but sometimes it interferes with life.
