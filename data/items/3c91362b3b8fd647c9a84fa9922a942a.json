  "description": "<p>Scot and Jeff discuss The Pogues with Alfred Schulz.</p>\n<p><b>Introducing the Band:</b></p>\n<p>Your hosts Scot Bertram (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/ScotBertram\" target=\"_blank\">@ScotBertram</a>) and Jeff Blehar (<a href=\"http://twitter.com/EsotericCD\" target=\"_blank\">@EsotericCD</a>) with guest<br /><br />\nAlfred Schulz. Alfred is a former SiriusXM host and producer and current podcast producer and, for eight years was the senior producer and on-air contributor to <i>Stand Up with Pete Dominick</i> and host of <i>Sit Down with Alfred and Chris,</i> covering the 2012 and 2016 Republican and Democratic conventions, the elections, and debates. Find him online at <a href=\"http://twitter.com/alfredschulz\" target=\"_blank\">@alfredschulz</a> on Twitter.</p>\n<p><b>Alfred’s Music Pick: The Pogues</b></p>\n<p>Happy St. Paddy’s Day! Okay, so you probably didn’t get to attend a parade (and we hope for prudence’s sake that you ‘socially distanced’ yourself on Saturday instead of hitting the bars), but let <em>Political Beats</em> keep you company this Monday instead as consolation as the gang covers the most Irish band of all time that is actually ironically composed mostly of English people, The Pogues! Yes, most of them had Irish blood running through their veins, but the fascinating thing about Shane MacGowan & company was how they actually emerged into prominence during the mid-’80s as rebellious standouts in the London music scene, where their fusion of Irish traditional music and punk drumming and speeds stood miles apart from everything else out there. Combining a magnificent touch for traditional and Irish covers with the magnificent lyrics and concepts of Shane MacGowan (whose self-presentation as a stumbling bad-toothed drunkard in no way disguised his literary skill), The Pogues redefined what was possible in terms of mixing popular and traditional music and also helped define a nation’s modern musical tradition in doing so. As Alfred points out: People will often put The Pogues on for St. Patrick’s Day, or maybe Christmas, but it’s music that deserves to be listened to all year ’round. Póg mo thóin, ladies and gents.</p>\n",
