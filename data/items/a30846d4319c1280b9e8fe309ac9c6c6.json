But navigating privacy regulations can be complex if you can’t dedicate resources to meet the varying regulatory requirements across the globe.  </p><br/><p>The process of consent management often entails:</p><ul><li><p>Notifying site visitors on how their data is being used</p></li><li><p>Enabling site visitors to provide consent or manage their data preferences</p></li><li><p>Communicating those preferences to advertising partners, so that they’re respected</p></li></ul><p>To help you gather and manage user consent for GDPR and opt-out requests for CCPA, we’ve launched new consent management features directly in <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/adsense/introducing-new-and-improved-auto-ads/\">AdSense Auto ads</a>. These features offer an easy way for you to communicate with your site visitors, providing them an opportunity to manage their data and privacy preferences. This also gives you the ability to gather consent for advertising purposes, so you can continue to grow advertising revenue and fund your content. </p><br/><p><b>Gather and manage consent for GDPR</b></p><p>AdSense’s consent management solution is integrated with the Interactive Advertising Bureau (IAB) Europe’s <a href=\"https://iabeurope.eu/transparency-consent-framework/\">Transparency and Consent Framework (TCF) v2.1</a>, which standardizes the process and offers common language for gathering consent under the GDPR and ePrivacy Directive. When an EEA or U.K. user visits your site from those regions, your GDPR consent message will display to give them options to manage their data, and their choices will be automatically respected by AdSense and communicated to your advertising partners. </p><br/><p><b>Gather opt out requests for CCPA</b></p><p>AdSense also supports the <a href=\"https://www.iab.com/guidelines/ccpa-framework/\">IAB's CCPA Compliance Framework</a>, which provides you with a standardized approach to manage opt-outs from users in this state. AdSense Auto ads detects when a user from California visits your site, shows them a CCPA opt out message, ensures their choice will be automatically respected by AdSense and makes the user’s choices available to other advertising partners you’ve integrated on the page. </p><br/><p><b>Grow revenue in a privacy-focused way</b></p><p>AdSense makes the process of gathering and managing consent easy. It allows you to communicate with your users and give them more transparency and control over how their data is being used. This makes it possible for you to continue to fund your content with advertising in a privacy-first way. </p><br/><p>The consent management solutions in AdSense are simple for publishers to use. As they’re already integrated into AdSense Auto ads, simply edit your site’s Auto ads settings, click “More features” and then turn on your consent messages. Of course, this feature is optional to use and you can work with any consent management platform of your choice. </p><br/><p>As new privacy regulations arise, we’ll continue to evolve our consent management solutions to help partners navigate user privacy decisions in a transparent way. We remain committed to helping site owners earn money through their content and grow their digital businesses for the future in a privacy-first ecosystem. Watch this space for further updates in the coming months.</p><br/><p>Please visit the <a href=\"https://support.google.com/adsense/answer/9460089\">AdSense help center</a> to learn more.</p><br/></div></div></body></html>",
