  "description": "<p>There are 3 types of people: Number 1, Number 2, and Number 3. Most people are Number 3. They aren’t extraordinary in any way, but can perform basic tasks. Number 2 is good, but not great. Number 1? Those are the type who demonstrate initiative, creativity, and execution.  They are rare and valuable.  They get paid extremely well because they deserve it. They have the life they want because they earned it. In this episode, I talk about how to manage all three types and how to become a Number 1.</p>",
