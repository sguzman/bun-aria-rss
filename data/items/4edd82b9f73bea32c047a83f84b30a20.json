  "description": "Air Force Colonel Allison Black, a pioneering aviator in Air Force Special Operations, is this episode’s guest. The former enlisted survival, evasion, resistance and escape specialist became an officer and AC-130H navigator.  She discusses what it is like being a leader in special operations today, how a “mission-first” philosophy is the foundation of her career, and what brought her into military service. <br /><br />Black, alongside USSOCOM Command Senior Enlisted Leader Greg Smith and Green Beret Matt Parrish, take “shots from the field” about standards, diversity and inclusion, roles of the senior enlisted leaders, the importance of being apolitical, and whether the word “elite” is an appropriate way to describe Special Operations Forces. We know you’ll enjoy hearing their philosophies on these issues facing SOF.<br /><br />_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ <br /> <br />SOFcast is the U.S. Special Operations Command official podcast where we harness the power of storytelling to connect you directly to thought-provoking and unique perspectives from our force. Listen to members of America's elite special operations forces gather to discuss current issues.
