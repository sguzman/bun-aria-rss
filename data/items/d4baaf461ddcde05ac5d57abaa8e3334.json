Maybe you've heard of him! Rather than discussing the events of his life, they dissect the tenets of his teachings and examine how his image has been whitewashed over the years. Not a lot of laughs in this here ep, but if you want to hear Dan have a little bit of a meltdown about the public conception of consent, this is the episode for you!</strong></p>",
