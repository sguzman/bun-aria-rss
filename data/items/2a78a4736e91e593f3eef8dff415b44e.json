  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Former Jehovah’s Witness Doug Smith and I talk about the Jehovahs. They. Are. Weird. Doug got raised in it when his mom decided some guy at her front door had great points. Parents never run it by their kids when they decide to join some cult. They always just sign everybody up for it without even a chance to weigh in. Anyway, it was a funny discussion of one of the world’s most interesting sects of Christianity. I guess those snake handlers might have them beat. And the Shakers. Did you know the Shakers let their prepubescent boys practice pulling out on post-menopausal women? Also, they made great furniture. So I guess top 5 of weird Christians would be Jehovah’s Witnesses, Mormons, Shakers, Snake handlers, and the Amish. Damn. That gives me 4 ideas for new podcasts.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">More from Doug!</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/whodougsmith\">Instagram</a></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href= \"https://twitter.com/whodougsmith\">Twitter</a></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more Ari: </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/arishaffir/\">Instagram</a></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> <a href= \"http://www.arishaffir.com/tour/\">Upcoming Shows</a></span></p> <p>The Music:</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Marvin Gaye - Can I Get A Witness</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Eels - Jehova’s Witness</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loretta Lynn - Happy Birthday Merry Christmas and Happy New Year</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Doug Smith - Stopping A Rape</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Raconteurs - Don’t Bother Me</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><strong>Thanks to our sponsors!</strong></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Go to BetterHelp.com/Ari for 10% off your first month of counseling. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Head over to 3Chi.com and use code \"Skeptic\" at checkout for 5% off your order!</span></p>",
