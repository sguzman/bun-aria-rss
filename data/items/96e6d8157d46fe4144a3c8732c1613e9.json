What is affiliate marketing?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Affiliate marketing is a way to make money by promoting the products and services of other people and companies. You don't need to create your product or service, just promote existing ones. That's why it's so easy to get started with affiliate marketing. You can even get started with no budget at all!</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">2. What is an affiliate program?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;An affiliate program is a package of information you create for your product, which is then made available to potential publishers. The program will typically include details about the product and its retail value, commission levels, and promotional materials. Many affiliate programs are managed via an affiliate network like ShareASale, which acts as a platform to connect publishers and advertisers, but it is also possible to offer your program directly.</span></p><h4 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">3. What is an affiliate network and how do affiliate networks make money?&nbsp;</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Affiliate networks connect publishers to advertisers.&nbsp; Affiliate networks make money by charging fees to the merchants who advertise with them; these merchants are known as advertisers.

What's the difference between affiliate marketing and dropshipping?</span></h4><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">&nbsp;Dropshipping is a method of selling that allows you to run an online store without having to stock products.

The distributor takes care of the post and packaging on your behalf.
