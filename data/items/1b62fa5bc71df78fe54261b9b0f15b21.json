  "description": "<p>Disorder and homogeneity are two concepts that refer to spatial variation of\nthe system potential. In condensed-matter systems disorder is typically divided\ninto two types; those with local parameters varying from site to site (diagonal\ndisorder) and those characterized by random transfer-integral values\n(off-diagonal disorder). Amorphous systems in particular exhibit off-diagonal\ndisorder due to random positions of their constituents. In real systems\ndiagonal and off-diagonal disorder may be interconnected. The formal depiction\nof disorder as local deviations from a common value focuses attention on the\nshort-range components of the potential-landscape. However, long range\npotential fluctuation are quite common in real systems. In this work we seek to\nfind a correlation between disorder and homogeneity using amorphous\nindium-oxide films with different carrier-concentrations and with different\ndegree of disorder. Thermal treatment is used as a means of fine tuning the\nsystem disorder. In this process the resistance of the sample decreases while\nits amorphous structure and chemical composition is preserved. The reduced\nresistivity affects the Ioffe-Regel parameter that is taken as a relative\nmeasure of disorder in a given sample. The homogeneity of the system was\nmonitored using inelastic light-scattering. This is based on collecting the\nRaman signal from micron-size spots across the sample. The statistics of these\nlow-energy data are compared with the sample disorder independently estimated\nfrom transport measurements. The analysis establishes that heterogeneity and\ndisorder are correlated.\n</p>",
