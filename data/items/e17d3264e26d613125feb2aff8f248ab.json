  "description": "Deborah Eden Tull's new book Relational Mindfulness: A Handbook for Deepening Our Connection with Ourselves, Each Other, and the Planet (Wisdom Publications, 2018) is a guidebook on how to embody compassionate awareness in all of our relationships — with self, one another, and our planet in an age of global uncertainty.\nWe all struggle at times with how to bring meditation off the cushion and into the beautiful, dynamic, and messy realm of relationship.\nAt a time when humanity seems to have forgotten our inherent interrelatedness, this book offers an inspiring set of principles and practices for deepening intimacy and remembering the interconnection that is our birthright. Eden Tull interweaves heartfelt personal stories, sharing her journey from seven years as a monastic in a silent Zen Monastery to living and teaching in the megatropolis of Los Angeles and beyond, with teachings and mindful inquiry to help the reader connect personally with the principles of Relational Mindfulness.\nIn a voice that is transparent, vulnerable, and brave, she shares possibilities for integrating mindfulness. In gentle yet powerful tone, she covers topics ranging from balance and personal sustainability to sexuality to conscious consumerism. Relational Mindfulness is based on the simple understanding that the most subtle form of love is attention. While a revolution usually means to evolve and change, this shift is actually a return to a simple and sacred understanding we seem to have forgotten —one we can only remember when we are present.\nEden Tull offers retreats, online courses, and consultations internationally.
