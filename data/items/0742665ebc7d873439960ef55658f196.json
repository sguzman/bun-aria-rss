  "description": "<p>This week on <em>Eat Your Words</em>, host Cathy Erway welcomes author and blogger Erin Alderson to the program. Author of “The Homemade Flour Cookbook: The Home Cook’s Guide to Milling Nutritious Flours and Creating Delicious Recipes with Every Grain, Legume, Nut, and Seed from A-Z,” Erin talks to Cathy about how she became inspired to dedicate an entire book on making this staple ingredient at home. She goes on to explain how milling at home can be less expensive and healthier than buying pre-ground flours. Much of the flour that is sold in grocery stores has been stripped of its nutrients and has extra ingredients and preservatives added to prolong shelf life. Not only that, but some flours, like almond, can run as high as $15 per bag! Exploring the different ways to grind flour including electric and non-electric grinders, food processors, blenders, and even coffee grinders, Erin strives to make it easy for any do-it-yourself homemaker to have fresh flour whenever needed. Tune in for an interesting conversation!
