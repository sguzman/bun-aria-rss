  "title": "171 - The Warsaw Ghetto - A Tale of Nazi Resistance",
  "description": "<p>Ummm.... more Nazis this week. Not EXACTLY a normal holiday choice, but what's normal on Timesuck? Today we look at the Warsaw Ghetto - the largest concentration of European Jews was in Poland, and more Polish Jews lived in Warsaw than in any other city - forced to live in a \"ghetto,\" a walled off city-within-a-city. And the Warsaw ghetto residents were treated horribly. They were shot, starved, and forced to live in squalor. They were taken by train to death camps. And they also fought back in the best example of Jewish resistance in WW2 history. Lot of sadness but also some inspiration in today's brave tale. Happy Holidays, everyone! <br /><br />Check out Lynze and I's new horror podcast <strong>Scared to Death.</strong> Listen on Spotify, Stitcher, iTunes, Youtube, and more!
