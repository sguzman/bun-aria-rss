  "description": "Financials are down almost 20% on the year… close to bear market territory. But the Fed releases stress test results tomorrow. The banks that pass will be allowed to significantly raise their dividend and launch huge buyback programs… On today’s show, I’ll tell you about about the huge short-term catalysts ahead for this dirt-cheap sector.

And we share some exciting details from our trip... Nate also discusses how coming industry regulations will lead to hundreds of millions of institutional dollars pouring into this sector. Trust me, you’ll want to hear this.",
