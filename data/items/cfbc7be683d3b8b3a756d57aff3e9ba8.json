To do so, I would go to the “Graphs” menu and select “Boxplot”, which provides me with the following dialog box:</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/rcmdr-boxplot-dialog-box.png\" alt=\"rcmdr-boxplot-dialog-box\" /></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\nRcmdr options for creating a Boxplot\n</p>\n\n<p><img src=\"/wp-content/uploads/2012/08/rcmdr-boxplot.png\" alt=\"rcmdr-boxplot\" /></p>\n\n<p class=\"wp-caption-text\">\nBoxplot output created by Rcmdr\n</p>\n\n<p>Within this dialog box, there are only 3 choices:  variable to plot (income), variable to break down the graph by (type), and “Identify outliers with mouse”, which allows for the user to point at the resulting graph to designate outliers to be labeled on the graph.  When I click “OK” in the dialog box, the result is the boxplot shown above. We can see that the “bc” (blue-collar) group has a lower mid-point to the  income range than “prof” (professors) and “wc” (white-collar).</p>\n\n<p>One of the best features of <a title=\"Rcmdr download at CRAN\" href=\"http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcmdr/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Rcmdr</a> is that not only do we get the output we requested, but the code window also shows the code that was necessary to create the boxplot.  In this example, the underlying R code is relatively simple:</p>\n\n<figure class=\"highlight\"><pre><code class=\"language-r\" data-lang=\"r\"><table class=\"rouge-table\"><tbody><tr><td class=\"gutter gl\"><pre class=\"lineno\">1\n</pre></td><td class=\"code\"><pre><span class=\"n\">boxplot</span><span class=\"p\">(</span><span class=\"n\">income</span><span class=\"o\">~</span><span class=\"n\">type</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">ylab</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s2\">\"income\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">xlab</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"s2\">\"type\"</span><span class=\"p\">,</span><span class=\"w\"> </span><span class=\"n\">data</span><span class=\"o\">=</span><span class=\"n\">Duncan</span><span class=\"p\">)</span>\n</pre></td></tr></tbody></table></code></pre></figure>\n\n<p>By providing the underlying code, <a href=\"http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcmdr/index.html\" title=\"Rcmdr download at CRAN\">Rcmdr</a> serves as a teaching tool to move the beginning user towards coding in R directly, or at least, modifying the tool-generated code to include titles or whatever options the user wants to add to the original analysis/output.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"installation-of-rcmdr\">Installation of Rcmdr</h2>\n\n<p>Sadly, <a href=\"http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcmdr/index.html\" title=\"Rcmdr download at CRAN\">Rcmdr</a> is one of those add-ins that seems to work better on Windows than Mac OSX, at least for the installation portion. I’ve been able to successfully install Rcmdr on my relatively old MacBook Pro, but it did take a bit of time to figure out.  Luckily, the instructions to install <a title=\"Rcmdr download at CRAN\" href=\"http://cran.r-project.org/web/packages/Rcmdr/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Rcmdr</a> on a Mac are fairly well laid out in <a href=\"http://wiki.math.yorku.ca/index.php/R:Installing_R_and_Rcmdr_on_a_MAC\" title=\"Rcmdr on Mac OSX\">this article</a>.</p>\n\n<p>However, once you get over the hurdle of downloading tcltk and XQuartz (X11 emulator), the program seems to work the same on both platforms.</p>"
