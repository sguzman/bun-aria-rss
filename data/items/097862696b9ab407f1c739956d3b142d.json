  "description": "Globalization is possibly the most important economic phenomenon of the past several decades. Opening borders, increasing trade and deepening integration has transformed our economies, our societies and our politics. Globalization changed establishment politics; the reaction against it transformed those against the establishment.\nBut there’s a world of difference between Donald Trump and Bernie Sanders’ critiques of globalization. And those who have concerns about globalization due so for different reasons, building different alliances as they work to implement, reform or roll back globalization.\nAnthea Roberts and Nicolas Lamp, authors of Six Faces of Globalization: Who Wins, Who Loses, and Why It Matters (Harvard University Press: 2021) looks more closely at these debates, building out distinct narratives that classify how we should think about the politics of globalization, and how different political movements understand who wins from globalization: everyone, a few, or nobody.\nThose interested in learning more about the book and its arguments:\n\n“Who wins and who loses from globalization? There are (at least) six answers”, a book excerpt published on BigThink\n\n\n“Want to know what future battles over globalization will be about? Look to the chip shortage”, a commentary piece published on Fortune\n\n\nPaul Krugman and Branko Milanovic in conversation with Anthea Roberts and Nicolas Lamp\n\nIn this interview, Anthea, Nicolas and I talk about the politics of globalization: the arguments used to support it, and the stories used to criticize it. We explore some of the interesting intersections between these arguments … and where we think the politics of globalization might go from here.\nAnthea Roberts is professor in the School of Regulation and Global Governance at Australian National University and author of the prizewinning Is International Law International? (Oxford University Press: 2017).\nNicolas Lamp is associate professor in the Faculty of Law at Queen’s University, Ontario. Before joining Queen’s University, he worked as a dispute settlement lawyer at the World Trade Organization.\nYou can find more reviews, excerpts, interviews, and essays at The Asian Review of Books, including its review of Six Faces of Globalization.
