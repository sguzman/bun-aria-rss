  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, tribute is paid to the life and legacy of comedic legend Jackie Mason. Mason was a patriot, a well-read constitutionalist, and a friend of this program. Then, it's circumstances that cause people to be passionate about causes. Whether it's liberty or the Olympics people take a principled stand on the issues that matter most to them. This is why red-blooded Americans are upset with the Democrats' failure at the border. Their uncertainty on whether the science says mask-mandates must be renewed or not. Whether the million people coming across the border are being vaccinated upon arrival or not- what is America to do? Later, Donald Trump gave a speech this weekend mentioning how disenchanted Americans have become with woke athletes in the Olympics and in particular the US women's soccer team. Trump shredded President Biden and reminded America that we must win the culture wars that it's faced with. The radical left attacks everything, including our words. To communists, language is an army of tools to resolve conflicts over their Marxist policies, hence why they incessantly hijack our language. Afterward, Sen. Chuck Schumer says that Trump is a despicable human being. He joins the ranks of Reps. Liz Cheney and Adam Kinzinger and nobody's falling for it. People see that so many areas of society are crumbling. All one needs to do is look at big cities with Democrat control to forecast what Democrats offer, crime, and massive government spending.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
