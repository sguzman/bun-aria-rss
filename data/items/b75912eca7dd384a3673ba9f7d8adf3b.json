Well-known for his CNBC appearances, Jon (along with his brother) is currently hanging his shingle at Market Rebellion.</p>\n\n<p>Don't even try to profit by reacting to the headlines, says Najarian. The machines are way ahead of even the most sophisticated traders. Instead, he says, have a plan in place for what names/sectors are going to be able to sustain a move after the headline has worn off.</p>\n\n<p>Getting to specifics, Najarian has put in place his plan for the trade war. He thinks there will be a resolution (and indeed both sides appeared to acknowledge a deal while this episode was being taped), but also that China - its economy under pressure thanks in part to trade - will continue to pump massive amounts of liquidity into the markets. His largest derivative position at this time is thus the iShares Emerging Markets ETF (EEM).</p>\n\n<p>Najarian is a big fan of the CME's newish Micro E-mini futures contracts, which allow individual investors to get in the futures game with far lower capital than even the E-mini futures. And it's not just about opening a position with a very modest margin requirement, but small players can now more easily tweak those positions as the time and price changes.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
