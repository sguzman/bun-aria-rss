  "description": "<p>We’ve all encountered technical documentation: Readmes, product manuals, and how-to guides, to name a few. Some are good, some are not so good, and some are less than helpful. Open source communities often need more people to write and update their projects’ documentation—but it’s not an easy task. So why not help out?<br /><br />In this episode of <a href=\"https://www.redhat.com/en/compiler-podcast\" target=\"_blank\">Compiler</a>, we find out why everyone should write at least a little bit of technical documentation. We speak to people who contributed to documentation to help, to learn, and even to start their careers in open source.</p><p>If you want to get involved with Fedora—technical writing included—check out <a href=\"https://whatcanidoforfedora.org\" target=\"_blank\">whatcanidoforfedora.org</a>.</p>\n",
