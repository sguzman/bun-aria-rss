  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">Right now, there’s a lot of opinions and discrepancies surrounding the idea of a COVID-19 booster shot. In fact, the FDA’s approval varies slightly from the CDC recommendations. It’s no wonder that there are a multitude of varying ideas on this topic.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p class=\"p1\">On today’s show, we’re going behind the scenes of the FDA booster approval and discussing the pertinent data on mRNA studies, the pharmaceutical industry at large, and the COVID-19 vaccine. You’re going to learn the specifics of the COVID-19 vaccine booster trials, how the FDA operates, and why some key information being reported is not quite what it seems.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p class=\"p1\">No matter where you stand on this issue, I hope you can approach this episode with an open mind, logic, and reason. I hope this episode gives you insight into clinical trials, government agencies, and how to take a broader look at what’s happening in our current events.
