  "title": "Fire And Fury: Inside The Trump White House by Michael Wolff",
  "description": "The most talked about book in politics today, Wolff gives frank details surrounding the inner workings of Trump’s presidency. From the campaign trail to tracking his first nine months, Wolff details how the relationships around Trump as well as his own personality has shaped his presidency to date. Filled with accusations and accounts of conversations, the book attempts to shed light on a presidency that has grabbed the worlds attention. The book was enlightening and shocking at times. What stood out was how mismanaged the environment surrounding Trump is, mostly due to his own planning. The author engages the reader throughout the book, however this is more because of the topic, rather than the way it was written. It must be noted as well that the comments and accusations made in this book are alleged and not confirmed. \n\nOMBR\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
