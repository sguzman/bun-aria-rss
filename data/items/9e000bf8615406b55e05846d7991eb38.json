OP works as an insurance adjuster, and he's working on a claim where a young driver clearly broke the law and was responsible for a 3-car crash. Despite the kid obviously being at fault, his parents call up OP and scream at him because they expect him to pay for the damage to his car. OP tries to explain that their kid is clearly the one at fault, but they just won't listen. They even ask him how they're supposed to commit insurance fraud when he's being so uncooperative!</p>\n",
