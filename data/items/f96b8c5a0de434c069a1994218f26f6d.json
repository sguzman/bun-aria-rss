  "description": "<p>It is now well-established that $\\Lambda$CDM predictions overestimate\ngravitational lensing measurements around massive galaxies by about 30%, the\nso-called lensing is low problem. Using a state-of-the-art hydrodynamical\nsimulation, we show that this discrepancy reflects shortcomings in standard\nstructure formation models rather than tensions within the $\\Lambda$CDM\nparadigm itself. Specifically, this problem results from ignoring a variety of\ngalaxy formation effects in simple models, including assembly bias, segregation\nof satellite galaxies relative to dark matter, and baryonic effects on the\nmatter distribution. Each of these contributes towards overestimating\ngravitational lensing and, when combined, these explain the amplitude and scale\ndependence of the lensing is low problem. We conclude that simplistic structure\nformation models are inadequate to interpret lensing and clustering together,\nand that it is crucial to employ more sophisticated models for the upcoming\ngeneration of large-scale surveys.\n</p>",
