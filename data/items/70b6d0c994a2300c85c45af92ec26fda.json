We will unveil what is planned for 2018 at the 33rd Anniversary Event!</p>\n<p>We will break down the latest issue of the best cigar magazine on the planet, Cigar Journal and we will even light up a couple of cigars. Including the Plus 90, which we got a lot of feedback and Barry will share the story at some point during our cigar experience as it is part of the Cigar Authority Care Package. In the second hour we will continue the Anniversary trend as we light up the cigar from Barry’s wedding on the eve of his 1st Anniversary.</p>\n<p>All that and the usual shenanigans with Debonaire Mr. J, Asylum Barry, Cigar News, Classic 3 Way and even a few mail bags..</p>\n<p>The Cigar Authority is recorded live in front of a studio audience at Studio 21 Podcast Cafe upstairs at Two Guys Smoke Shop in Salem, NH and as always you can find many of the cigars we discuss at <a href='http://www.2guyscigars.com/'>http://www.2GuysCigars.com/</a>.</p>\n",
