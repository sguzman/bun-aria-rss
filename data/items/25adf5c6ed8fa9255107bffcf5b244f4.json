  "description": "<p>Why are Christians more quiet about their faith now than in past generations and how can one feel confident to share their love for Christ openly and winsomely? In this talk, Tim Keller asks this question: In its early days, when there was great social cost to becoming a Christian, how did the Christian church grow?</p>\n<p>You'll hear the answer through the example of the woman at the well. After she encountered Jesus, she had a joy inside her that she couldn't keep in, as she shared the hope she had in Christ's unique offer of salvation. She wanted people she knew to know who Jesus was to her, and her honest and organic testimony was a hopeful, simple and a natural outcome of encountering Christ.</p>\n<p>This talk was given by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on January 17, 2019. </p>\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.
