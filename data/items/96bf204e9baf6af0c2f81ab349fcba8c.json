It seems to be a typical venture-backed startup firm, but it is not quite that, either. There's a lot more under the surface of App.net, including neutrally hosted services, ecosystems aimed at software developers, and crowdfunding, among other topics, which we talk about in this episode.</p>\n<p>App.net is offering a limited number of free-tier accounts, introduced last week and explained in the podcast, to listeners of The New Disruptors.
