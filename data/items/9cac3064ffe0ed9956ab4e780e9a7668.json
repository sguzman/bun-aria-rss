  "description": "Athens based designer Jade Joyner joins the show this week to talk about Metal + Petal, the full service interior design firm that she and her husband own and operate. We hear the inspiration behind Jade’s use of bold yet tasteful patterns and textures, and why she believes sometimes less is more. Jade also gives her advice on where to splurge and where to save, why she loves a good console table, and designing living rooms and kitchens for big families.\nWhat You’ll Hear on This Episode:\n\nWhere Jade developed an eye for the bold and sculptural pieces we see on her blog and social media\n\nJade’s use of unique silhouettes to create interest in a room\n\nJade’s work with the Alpha Phi sorority to renovate a historic home into a residence for the group of young women\n\nWhy Jade suggests carrying some aspect of a room’s color all throughout the house, whether it is in an accent piece, paint color, or accessory\n\nDon’t be afraid to edit. Jade reminds us that often, less is more.\n\nSome of Jade’s tips for using custom tables and sofas in living rooms, and why a great sofa that stands the test of time is one of her top items to splurge on.\n\nHear why Jade loves a beautiful console table, and quite frankly — we agree!\n\nOur realization that ranches may be the next big dream home. They are spacious, more affordable, and offer things traditional houses may not.\n\nWhat projects Jade has now, including the Golden Pantry Market where she works with local artisans based in Athens.\n\nBehind the scenes of what really goes through a designer’s mind when their home is part of a photoshoot or magazine spread.",
