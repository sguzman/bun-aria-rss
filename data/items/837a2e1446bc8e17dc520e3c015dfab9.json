  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">The exit poll data from the election is in, and it looks like white evangelicals are as politically conservative and Republican as ever. Professor of political science from Eastern Illinois University, Ryan Burge, joins the Holy Post crew to discuss the findings. He says Democrats should give up on white evangelical voters who are now more Republican than Christian. Burge also looks at the formative power of cable news, why pastors are afraid to address the idolatry of politics in their pews, and why the data says the future of evangelicalism will be dramatically different. Also this week, Drew Dyck is back with his latest book selections to survive the pandemic. Plus, Tesla owners beware—you could accidentally butt dial a very expensive upgrade for your car.</p> <p class=\"p1\"><a class=\"c-link\" href= \"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/07/tesla-app-butt-dial-purchases-still-possible-refunds-hard-to-get.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link= \"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/07/tesla-app-butt-dial-purchases-still-possible-refunds-hard-to-get.html\" data-sk= \"tooltip_parent\">https://www.cnbc.com/2020/10/07/tesla-app-butt-dial-purchases-still-possible-refunds-hard-to-get.html</a><br />  <a class=\"c-link\" href= \"https://religioninpublic.blog/2019/02/05/is-white-born-again-christian-just-a-synonym-for-republican/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link= \"https://religioninpublic.blog/2019/02/05/is-white-born-again-christian-just-a-synonym-for-republican/\" data-sk= \"tooltip_parent\">https://religioninpublic.blog/2019/02/05/is-white-born-again-christian-just-a-synonym-for-republican/</a><br />  <a class=\"c-link\" href= \"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/06/opinion/evangelicals-republicans.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link= \"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/06/opinion/evangelicals-republicans.html\" data-sk= \"tooltip_parent\">https://www.nytimes.com/2020/11/06/opinion/evangelicals-republicans.html</a></p>",
