  "description": "In today’s episode, Birmingham, Alabama interior designer Dana Wolter joins the podcast to about how to create drama and edge in design, ways to use texture and layers to create softness, and the magic of drapery panels.\nWhat You’ll Hear On This Episode:\n\nTrials and triumphs about the most traumatic power outage, new house plans, digital picture frames, adjusting to a longer working from home schedule, paint color testing, rose tips, and some fun basement renovation.\n\nDana’s goal is to give her clients something custom, unique, long-lasting, and special to them. When using trendy pieces, she tends to pick items that are a lower price point so it’s not a huge loss to move along from them every few years.\n\nDana gives some advice on creating drama and edge using different layers and textures.\n\nJust because a space is neutral, doesn’t mean there isn’t a lot of depth and layering.\n\nWhen the architecture is strong, we need less drama in our design.\n\nComing from a large family, Dana understands first hand how important it is to create a space that is comfortable and able to expand with any family needs.\n\nDana’s take on how high up the wall art should go up to create balance and work with the scale of a room.\n\nWhy we just love sconces so much not only to fill the room with light but add an element of drama and art.\n\nA pair of chaise lounge chairs in the living room can be a comfortable and inviting solution for more seating.\n\n\nMentioned In This Episode:\n@danawolterinteriors\nDana Wolter Interiors\nTraditional Home Spring 2020\nLivable Home\nBallard Designs IG TV\nWilliam McClure\nSkylight Digital Picture Frame\n\nDecorating Dilemma:\nCongrats on your new home and you are so close! We need to find a way to ground the space in the dining area, and a banquette would add some weight. Check out the Coventry one that we have at Ballard. Add some sconces! We love the art on the credenza, placing a beautiful bowl with some books could add layers to your already wonderful foundation. We have an acrylic bar cart that would vibe with your modern yet traditional look, and this would bring in another fun texture.",
