  "description": "This week on the Colin and Samir Podcast, we talk about our latest movie, The Lost Pyramid, with Ammar Kandil of Yes Theory. If you haven’t heard about it yet, we spent the last month working on a movie with our friends at Yes Theory, it was one of our toughest projects to date, but we’re really excited about the story that we got to tell. \n\nOn this episode we talk to Ammar about the process of making the film, and bring you guys behind the scenes of what our last few weeks have been like working on this movie. We also talk about how we released the film, which was a total experiment for us - We released the movie using a “pay what’s fair” model - meaning that the audience gets to decide how much they want to contribute to watch the movie. \nSo this is now our 3rd documentary this year and our second documentary with Yes Theory, and also our second podcast with Ammar, if you haven’t heard the first one definitely go back and check that out, there are some awesome stories in there. \nIf you haven’t seen the doc yet, head to yestheory.com/documentary to check it out and you can contribute what you want to watch the film. Alright we hope you enjoy this episode of the Colin and Samir podcast featuring Ammar Kandil.",
