  "description": "<p>Joseph Duncan. What a terrible, terrible dude. This was one of the hardest episodes we've done yet. I knew it would be dark, but, I didn't know it would be THIS dark. The worst of Duncan's crimes happened just a few miles from the Suck Dungeon. In mid-May of 2005, Duncan brutally murdered three family members just outside of Couer d'Alene Idaho. He also kidnapped two more and did unspeakable things to them. And he sits on death row today for these and other terrible crimes. If the true crime episodes are not your favorites... sit this one out. </p>\n<p>Check out Lynze and I's new horror podcast <strong>Scared to Death.</strong> Listen on Spotify, Stitcher, iTunes, Youtube, and more!
