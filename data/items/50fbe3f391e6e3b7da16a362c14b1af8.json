  "description": "After a few weeks off Tim and Mark are reviewing some of the major stories that we missed recently starting with the factory collapse in Bangladesh that killed 1100 people.  In Libya there have been various protests against the government and militias related to a new law regarding former Qaddafi government workers.   The US continues to debate getting involved in Syria and what their involvement should be.  Over in Pakistan the latest elections have brought back the once ousted Nawaz Sharif as president. Iceland's latest votes have kicked out the center left, brought on the center right, and set back hopes of a new constitution.  In keeping with politics, Flattr and Piratebay cofounder (and friend of this show) Peter Sunde has announced he will run for European Parliament in 2014 as a member of the Pirate Party in Finland. Our NEWZ Source for this week is a very old and very useful scientific research magazine - NATURE.",
