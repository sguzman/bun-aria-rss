  "description": "<p>It’s time to dispel the myth that you need to have a huge salary, or that you need to work and save for decades, in order to eventually retire. This week we’re excited to hear from Jillian Johnsrud as she shares with us how she became financially independent at the age of 32, despite her and her husband never making more than 60k a year. We cover how they paid cash for their first house, how they continue to save and invest with 5 kids at home, as well as the importance of their \"quit list\" as they seek to live an intentional and adventure filled life.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed an Official IPA by Bell’s Brewery- a big thanks to our friends at Bell’s for donating these beers to the show!
