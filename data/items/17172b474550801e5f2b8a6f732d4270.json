  "description": "<p>Notorious Boston crime boss and friend of James J. \"Whitey\" Bulger Howie Winter died of a heart attack last week at the age of 91. The underworld figure was responsible for the rise of the murderous Whitey Bulger and an unknown number of murders himself. But that didn't stop a pair of Globe writers, Shelley Murphy and Kevin Cullen, from eulogizing the murderer, downplaying his atrocities, and attempting to turn him into a folk hero. In today's show, Kirk offers a case study in what it takes to work for the Boston Globe.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
