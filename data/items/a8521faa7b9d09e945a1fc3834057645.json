ONE. It would mean a lot to me. It would prove my point about solid right hooks. You’ve watched thirty or so episode for free, and now I’m asking you for this one thing. Buy one.</p>\n<p>And so, that is a right hook my friends. You just honestly ask. You try to create a little guilt around it. And you ask.</p>\n<p>Don’t hold back and be honest.</p><img src=\"http://feedpress.me/9857/578135.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>",
