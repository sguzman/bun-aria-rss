    "media:description": "Jen learned she was infertile after being diagnosed with endometriosis, polycystic ovary syndrome, and adenomyosis.  She feels like a failure even while her husband, Rob, assures her that it is not her fault. After 15 years the two are still praying for a miracle baby, but every day that passes without one makes their pain grow.\n\nJen's YouTube Channel: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCw1oSy8OpkpeXoLNccwotNg\n\nSupport SBSK at https://www.patreon.com/SBSK\n\nSBSK's Socials: \nhttp://www.instagram.com/specialbooksbyspecialkids\nhttps://twitter.com/chrisulmer\nhttps://www.facebook.com/specialbooksbyspecialkids",
