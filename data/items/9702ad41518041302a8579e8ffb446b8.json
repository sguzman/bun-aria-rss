  "description": "On Monday’s Mark Levin Show, Rich Valdes, Mr Call Screener, fills in for Mark. It’s been 10 years since occupy wall street and the radical all-out crazy left wing of the Democrat Party and now they are stronger than ever. In 10 years they’ve gone from occupying a small park in NYC to occupying Congress, newsrooms, classrooms, and even the White House. The left is threatening the livelihood of free thinkers to keep them in line. We need to replace them. Replace your school board, become the teacher or the professor. The goal is and always was, to win the battle in the free marketplace of ideas. But the Americans on the left have put their thumbs on the scale. Then, Abraham Lincoln gave us a warning in his Lyceum Address. He explains to us what is to come if people in government become corrupted. Later, the southern border is wide open and the White House seems like they don’t care. Donald Trump fixed this crisis but it came back because of President Biden’s incompetence.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
