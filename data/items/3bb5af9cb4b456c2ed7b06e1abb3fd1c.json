  "description": "In July of 2012, two girls disappeared in Evansdale, Iowa while riding their bikes. Police set out looking for them right away, but despite an exhaustive search, receiving tips from locals, and finding CCTV footage of the girls, all the investigation turned up was their bikes. Five months later, both of their bodies were found, but was this the work of a serial killer, or someone else hiding right under everyone's noses? This the story of Lyric Cook and Elizabeth Collins, also known as the Evansdale Murders.\nBONUS EPISODE\npatreon.com/goingwestpodcast\nCASE SOURCES\n﻿1.
