  "description": "Emily discusses why women are simply better than men with television host, legal analyst, and best-selling author Dan Abrams. Abram uses research to invalidate sexist cliches about the differences between men and women in his book, Man Down: Proof Beyond a Reasonable Doubt That Women Are Better Cops, Drivers, Gamblers, Spies, World Leaders, Beer Tasters, Hedge Fund Managers, and Just About Everything Else. Emily corroborates Abrams findings while her co-host Menace is skeptical, wondering if Abrams just wrote the book to get laid. But Emily doesn't think Abrams needs to write a book celebrating women to do well with the ladies (she used to date Abrams herself). Contrary to popular opinion, Abrams argues why women are better at driving and making decisions. Men on the other hand are better at parking and getting hit by lightening.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
