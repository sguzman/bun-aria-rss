  "description": "Central banks started life as clearing houses and have evolved into instruments to, supposedly, protect the economy. But with interest rates at all time lows, often in the negative, have they gone as far as they can go? And how can they control the economy when governments can implement a fiscal approach at odds with monetary policy.

Or is that a breach of democracy? Phil Dobbie discusses the idea with Prof Steve Keen.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
