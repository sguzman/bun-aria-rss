  "description": "Contributor(s): Imaobong Umoren | Imaobong Umoren discusses the lives of three black activist women: Eslanda Robeson, Paulette Nardal, and Una Marson. She explains how, between the 1920s and the 1960s, the trio participated in global freedom struggles by traveling; building networks in feminist, student, black-led, anticolonial, and antifascist organizations; and forging alliances with key leaders. This made them race women internationalists—figures who engaged with a variety of interconnected internationalisms to challenge various forms of inequality facing people of African descent across the diaspora and the continent. #Imaobong Umoren #activism #feminism #black history #women's history #intellectual history #black internationalism #diaspora For further information about the Department of International History at LSE please visit www.lse.ac.uk/International-History",
