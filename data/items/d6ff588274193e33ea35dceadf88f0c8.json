  "description": "<p>Yesterday's lunch after the Miltons trip was one Kirk wants to forget as soon as he can. With this being the final show before Madawaska of course Justin screws up so bad that the entire event is in jeopardy. Thankfully the KMS electric guy, Matt Carano, swoops in and saves the day. Justin does try to make up for his ineptitude by sharing a secret Chick-Fil-A hack that you won't believe.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
