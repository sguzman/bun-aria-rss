  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">With the implosion of evangelical purity culture, and news that its poster child is getting divorced, many are reevaluating the legacy of the movement that dominated youth ministries in the 80s and 90s. Katelyn Beaty is back to talk about her recent article about the problems with the sexual ethics of both evangelical and secular cultures. Also this week, a Catholic school in Indiana is getting heat for firing a teacher in a gay marriage, and the Evangelical Covenant Church banished a 134-year-old congregation for its LGBT policy. These stories provoke the question: Is it still ok for Christian organizations to enforce Christian beliefs? And what does the future look like when nearly half of millennial evangelicals support same-sex marriage?</p>",
