  "description": "<p>We present a method for constructing multiphase excitations in the generally\nnon-integrable system of warm fluid equations describing plasma oscillations.\nIt is based on autoresonant excitation of nonlinear electron plasma waves by\nphase locking with small amplitude chirped-frequency ponderomotive drives. We\ndemonstrate the excitation of these multiphase waves by performing fully\nnonlinear numerical simulations of the fluid equations. We develop a simplified\nmodel based on a weakly nonlinear analytical theory by applying Whitham's\naveraged Lagrangian procedure. The simplified model predictions are in good\nagreement with the results from the warm fluid simulations. Such autoresonantly\nexcited multiphase waves form coherent quasicrystalline structures, which can\npotentially be used as plasma photonic or accelerating devices. Finally, we\ndiscuss the laser parameters required for the autoresonant excitation of\nnonlinear waves in a plasma.\n</p>",
