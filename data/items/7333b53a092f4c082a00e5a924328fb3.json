  "description": "<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Have you ever received oral sex from a beautiful French woman at 200 miles an hour? Teenage Brendan Taylor had always believed that those Penthouse forum stories were complete fabrications; he’s focusing on his studies, not girls. And for a lanky, inexperienced country boy first trip’s to France, this young nerd is most excited about the train ride from Paris to Marseille on the TGV bullet train. Electric! High Speed! Yet when a sophisticated Parisian woman takes an interest, he begins to feel a different kind of electricity. Those French lessons don’t seem quite so important now, because Brendan’s discovered the universal language. #SinkOrSwim #Croissant #Bonjour #Unzipped</strong></p> <p class=\"p2\"> </p> <p class=\"p3\"><strong>Song: ‘Finally Woken’ (Jem)</strong></p> <p class=\"p1\"><strong><em>About the Storyteller:</em></strong></p> <p class=\"p2\"> </p> <p class=\"p4\"><strong>Brendan Taylor was born and raised in a small town in the Midwest in the 70s. He enjoys many shades of off-white from eggshell to ecru, and likes just a *touch* of vanilla. He gets migraines like a lawyer bills hours, curses like a barefoot sailor in a Lego factory, and is full of surprises and stories. He chased a woman to San Francisco 26 years ago and it seems to be working out so far.</strong></p> <p class=\"p5\"> </p> <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Episode links:</strong></span></p> <p class=\"p2\"> </p> <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>OUR LIVE SHOW and LIVESTREAM:</strong></span> <strong>Our next Bawdy happens right after the Pride Parade on Sunday June 26th.
