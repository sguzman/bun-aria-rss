  "description": "John Morrow and Jeffrey Sammons share their insights on the story of the fabled 369th Infantry Regiment in their book, Harlem’s Rattlers and the Great War: The Undaunted 369th Regiment and the African American Quest for Equality (University Press of Kansas, 2014). Our guests reveal a great deal about the state of African Americans in prewar New York civil and political society, while also presenting for the first time a complete narrative of the regiment’s service in the First World War, using American, French, and German archives. Harlem’s Rattlers and the Great War is the most authoritative and compelling history of this famous regiment, and goes far to restore their actual experiences to public notice, while also dispelling many misperceptions and myths that have accrued over the last century.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
