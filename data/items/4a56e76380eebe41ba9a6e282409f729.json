A Protestant and member of the Unity of Brethren, he lived much of his life in exile, expelled from his homeland under the Catholic Counter-Reformation, and he wanted to address the deep antagonisms underlying the wars that were devastating Europe especially The Thirty Years War (1618-1648).  A major part of his plan was Universal Education, in which everyone could learn about everything, and better understand each other and so tolerate their religious differences and live side by side.  His ideas were to have a lasting influence on education, even though the peace that followed the Thirty Years War only entrenched the changes in his homeland that made his life there impossible.\n\nThe image above is from a portrait of Comenius by Jürgen Ovens, 1650 - 1670, painted while he was living in Amsterdam and held in the Rikjsmuseum\n\nWith\n\nVladimir Urbanek\nSenior Researcher in the Department of Comenius Studies and Early Modern Intellectual History at the Institute of Philosophy of the Czech Academy of Sciences\n\nSuzanna Ivanic\nLecturer in Early Modern European History at the University of Kent\n\nAnd\n\nHoward Hotson\nProfessor of Early Modern Intellectual History at the University of Oxford and Fellow of St Anne’s College\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson",
