Miraculously, he recovered from what by all accounts was a hopeless and incomprehensible state of desperation and demoralization.</p><p>His reward? A beautiful life. A family. The gift of helping countless achieve and maintain sobriety.</p><p>Then liver cancer.</p><p>The prognosis? 14 months.

It's about human will, courage, faith and surrender.</p><p>The story of Chris Davis is a hero's journey worthy of Joseph Campbell himself.</p><p>It's a privilege to have this man in my life. It’s a privilege to call him friend.
