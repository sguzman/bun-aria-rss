  "description": "<p>As a reminder that we are spiritual beings inhabiting a material world -- wandering this rotating orb as it hurls across the multiverse&nbsp;— it's time to once again transcend the mortal coil to connect with all things ethereal.</p><p>Our guide for today's celestial adventure is the candescent <strong>Radhanath Swami</strong>.</p><p>A New York Times best-selling author, monk, philanthropist, activist and teacher, his Holiness Radhanath Swami is a man that radiates love, compassion and grace with a sweet and joyous disposition that has immeasurably impacted millions of souls across the world.</p><p>Born Richard Slavin to middle-class parents in Chicago, he came of age amidst the strife and upheaval of the 1960s. A social activist, he slowly became disillusioned with the structural mandates of the western civilized way of life. So, still in his late teens, he left Chicago behind in search of greater meaning. After hitchhiking across the world, he felt called to India. There he met his spiritual teacher, catalyzing his&nbsp;transformation into the mystic he is today.</p><p>Along the way, Radhanath Swami has founded multiple spiritual communities throughout the world, the most prominent of which is the Radha-Gopinath Ashram located in Mumbai, India. Under his inspiration and guidance, the project has grown to include hospitals, orphanages, a UN-awarded eco-friendly farm, schools, temples, emergency relief programs, and a food distribution program that feeds more than 300,000 children in India every single day.&nbsp;</p><p>In addition, he teaches Eastern philosophy and spiritually throughout Europe, Asia, and America. His wisdom has reached over 100,000,000 views on social media in the last year. He has been featured as a guest speaker at Oxford, Cambridge, Princeton, Harvard, Columbia and Stanford, and at corporations such as HSBC, Microsoft, Facebook, Google, Intel and Oracle. Along the way he has&nbsp;met with many a world leader, including Barak Obama and former Prime ministers Tony Blair, David Cameron and Prime Minister Narendra Modi.</p><p><em>Today he shares his story.</em></p><p>This conversation is fueled by my concern for cultural cohesion -- a desire to help mend the vitriolic division and existential tension that is tearing us apart.</p><p>Therefore, beyond exploring Radhanath Swami's story of origin, we spend the gravamen of our exchange examining what he calls <em>'the light'. </em>It's about how to embody the space within ourselves that brims with compassion and empathy -- and why a committed spiritual practice is more important now than ever.</p><p>I understand that some may recoil when it comes to topics spiritual. But this is not about religion. And it's not about dogma. Simply put, it's about why love is the answer.</p><p>So look past the robe. Set aside preconceived opinions. Open your heart a crack. And be present to receive what this evolved human has to share. If you do, I think this powerful conversation will leave you feeling nourished, more hopeful and immensely more positive about our global predicament.&nbsp;</p><p>Today's mind meld is viewable (via Zoom) on <a href=\"https://youtu.be/PEmaWdfUUuk\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube</a>.
