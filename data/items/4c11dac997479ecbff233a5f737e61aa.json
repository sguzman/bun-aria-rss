  "description": "<p>Kevin Meaney invited me over to his apartment to talk about what it was like coming out of the closet at 50 years old. He was married with a kid when he did it. This was such a great podcast. He was open and honest and had such a unique difficult time of coming to be open about who he is. I hope you enjoy it and use it to help you give up the secrets you're holding onto. </p>",
