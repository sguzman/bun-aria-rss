We will also run into betrayal, prophetic dreams, epic battles, Xenophon’s rise to leadership, heartbreaking moments, tribal guerrillas in the mountains, poisoned honey, athletic competitions, sweet revenge, and the planting of the seeds for Alexander the Great’s campaigns.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n\n<p class=\"\">This episode is sponsored by <a href=\"http://www.geeknationtours.com\">www.geeknationtours.com</a> In addition to offering tours to many locations that would be of interest to fans of history, this summer they will lead a tour to the Little Big Horn Battlefield in Montana, site of the 1876 epic clash between the 7th Cavalry and the Lakota and Cheyenne forces. Incidentally, I plan on dedicating a multi-part series to this topic within the next few months.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">Also, please show some love to my regular sponsors by shipping for supplements, special foods, clothing, and exercise equipment at <a href=\"http://www.onnit.com/history\">http://www.onnit.com/history</a> and receive a 10% discount.
