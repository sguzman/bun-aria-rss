Matt overcomes his post vaccine illness, Heath and Mariah take a stomach turning trip, and the thought of Zane reading a book makes him queezy. The JUICE and the funny are brought to a whole new level this week when we find out our house’s exciting history. So, turn off the gps and get lost with us, as we try to be less confused about life. What else is new, right?! (Besides our coffee flavors which you can find at <a href=\"http://kramoda.com\">kramoda.com</a>) Enjoy! :-)</p>\n",
