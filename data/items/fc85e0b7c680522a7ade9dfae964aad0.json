  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin show, we bring you the Best of Mark Levin! We were furious that the GOP was sending the president a continuing resolution that did not include money for a border wall. But the president righty asked for the $5 Billion to be included in the budget and you, the listeners made it happen -- you're voices matter and you're voices were heard! The House voted 217-185 in favor of $5 billion for the border wall. Let's see if Leader McConnell can manage to get this measure passed in the Senate. Also, President Trump has dug his heels in on a troop withdrawal from Syria. We maintain minimal assets in Syria and are achieving maximum results by being there. This is completely different from our presence in Afghanistan where we are not succeeding and have a much larger footprint in Afghanistan yet we have no control. This is about making the right decision, and it's dangerous radical libertarians like Sen Rand Paul who provoke wars that lead to massive casualties through their policy of weakening the military. Sen Mike Lee is equally as disappointing when it come to his radical libertarian views of national security. The truth is that Congress authorizes and approves appropriations for military activity and not a single soldier can be placed abroad with out funding from congress which controls the power of the purse. Just because the U.S disengages does not mean the enemy disengages, and that's why Vladimir Putin praised Trump's decision to pullout of Syria. This leaves our Kurdish and Israeli allies exposed and alone to fend for themselves. If we can't be bothered by what happens outside of America then why do we have bases abroad, why do we have aircraft carriers in international seas? Finally, William Barr is a brilliant attorney that's under attack for sharing a personal opinion on Robert Mueller. The test for Attorney General is not whether we agree or disagree with him, its whether he'll uphold the Constitution with integrity, and we don't nee Chuck Schumer or Mark Warner to behave as jackals and obstruct his appointment.
