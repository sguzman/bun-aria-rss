  "description": "<p>I spoke to two hunters today who talked about having strange experiences while out hunting.</p> <p>Both hunters talked about being screamed and roared at. The witnesses are from two different states, they both talked about hearing what sounded like little kids laughing in the woods and carrying on with this strange gibberish. As I spoke to each witness, it was strange how similar their encounters were.</p> <p>I had a gentleman on the show awhile back who was from Oregon and he talked about hearing this strange gibberish and laughter. I believe the following day he had rocks thrown at him. I have been looking for the old episode...</p> <p>I will also be speaking to Steven who will be sharing with us some of the encounters he has put together on his new website <a href=\"http://www.lonestar-ape.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">www.lonestar-ape.com</a></p> <p>If you get a chance check it out!</p>",
