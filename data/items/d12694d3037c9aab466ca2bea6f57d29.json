    "media:description": "This weekend, nearly all of us will set our clocks back one hour. It's part of the twice-a-year ritual of alternating between daylight saving time and standard time. William Brangham looks at the history of changing the clock and a movement to do away with this process, once and for all.\n\nEditor's Note: This report contained an error in that it misspelled Senator Patty Murray (D-Washington) name in the lower third font.
