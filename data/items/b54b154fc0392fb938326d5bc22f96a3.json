  "description": "<p>When it comes to understanding human nutrition, there are a lot of conflicting opinions, science, and dogmas out there. Whether you eat a ketogenic diet, are passionate about veganism, or don’t subscribe to any type of diet at all—I support you in that. Diet can be a very individual thing that can incorporate your culture, traditions, health conditions and sensitivities, and so much more.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p>That being said, there is a lot to be gained from being open-minded and listening to others who have differing perspectives. Today’s guest, Dr. Paul Saladino is the leading authority on the science and application of the carnivore diet. In his practice, he has helped hundreds of patients improve their chronic inflammation, mental health issues, and autoimmune diseases.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p>On today’s show, he’s here to discuss some of the major talking points about the carnivore diet. We’ll discuss humans as hunter-gatherers, dive into anthropological discussions about evolution and diet, and talk about nutrients and disease prevention, and more. If you’ve had any questions or objections about the carnivore diet, I hope this episode will act as a helpful resource.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p><strong>In this episode you’ll discover:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Why it’s important to listen to <strong>differing perspectives</strong>.</li> <li>The differences between a meat-based diet and an animal-based diet.</li> <li>Which key nutrients are found in organ meat.</li> <li>The truth about <strong>nutritional deficiencies</strong> on a carnivore diet.</li> <li>Which metric is best for measuring vitamin C deficiency.</li> <li>How plant-based foods can trigger inflammation.</li> <li>Why we need to consider <strong>genetic variability</strong> when it comes to diet.</li> <li>The difference between molecular hormetic and environmental hormetic.</li> <li>What studies show about removing fruits and vegetables from the human diet.</li> <li>Why toxins exist in plants.</li> <li>The importance of thinking about diet through an <strong>evolutionary lens</strong>.</li> <li>How meat has been vilified as a source of cancer and obesity.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></li> <li>Why LDL cholesterol alone is not a good predictor of heart disease.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></li> <li>How <strong>inflammation and insulin resistance</strong> relate to cardiovascular health.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Items mentioned in this episode include:</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href= \"https://themodelhealthshow.com/onnit\">Onnit.com/model</a> ⇐ Get your optimal health & performance supplements at 10% off!</li> <li><a href= \"https://themodelhealthshow.com/ease-magnesium\">Easemagnesium.com/model</a> ⇐ Get an exclusive 15% off here!</li> <li><a href= \"https://www.amazon.com/Social-Leap-Evolutionary-Science-Where/dp/0062740393\"> The Social Leap by William von Hippel</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://carnivoremd.com/book/\">The Carnivore Code by Paul Saladino, MD</a></li> <li>Connect with Dr. Paul Saladino <a href= \"https://carnivoremd.com/\">Website</a> / <a href= \"https://carnivoremd.com/podcast/\">Podcast</a> / <a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/carnivoremd/\">Instagram</a></li> </ul> <p>* <a href= \"https://themodelhealthshow.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Episode+379.pdf\"> <em>Download Transcript</em></a></p> <p><strong>Be sure you are subscribed to this podcast to automatically receive your episodes: </strong></p> <ul> <li><a href= \"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-model-health-show/id640246578\"> Apple Podcasts</a></li> <li><a href= \"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/model-health-show/the-model-health-show\"> Stitcher</a></li> <li><a href= \"https://open.spotify.com/show/6F3aCAq1L6k3eVqfaveMCp\">Spotify</a></li> <li><a href= \"https://soundcloud.com/themodelhealthshow\">Soundcloud</a></li> </ul> <p>Join TMHS Facebook community - <a href= \"https://www.facebook.com/groups/2393689010676188/\">Model Nation</a> </p>",
