  "description": "Bruce Springsteen is an American icon, known to his fans as “Bruce” and the “Boss.” Springsteen burst onto the American music scene in 1975 with the release of his classic album, Born To Run. His concerts are legendary, and his music offers keen insight on American society.\n\nIn Bruce Springsteen: American Poet and Prophet (Scarecrow Press, 2014), Donald Deardorff explores the lyrics of Bruce Springsteen and uses them to explore what they reveal about American culture. The book examines how Springsteen’s career represents and comments on the tremendous changes that have shaped the United States since World War II. Deardorff traces the development in Springsteen’s thought, giving equal weight to both the early and late part of his career.\n\nIn the podcast, we explore a wide range of topics, including artistic influences on Bruce, Springsteen’s analysis of the crisis in masculinity, Bruce’s response to postmodernism, and even the surprising range of artists Bruce has influenced.\n\nDonald Deardorff has taught numerous courses in American literature and literary criticism at Cedarville University Ohio, since 1996. He is the author of The Image of God in the Human Body: Essays on Christianity and Sports and Sports: A Reference Guide and Critical Commentary, 1980-1999.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
