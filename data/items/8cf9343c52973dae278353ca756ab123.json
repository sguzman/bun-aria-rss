  "description": "On the Best of Mark Levin, the Russian troops are busy murdering torturing, raping, and molesting Ukrainian citizens. When Russians in Moscow speak out, they're sent to a modern-day gulag for years. Unless the Ukrainians get the military equipment they need their people will continue to be brutalized. The January 6 committee leaked information to the media but there's only one problem, it's a lie. While Democrats claimed that there was a gap in President Trump's phone records but a review of records from the National Archives shows that there are no missing logs or phone calls as the whole story was fabricated by Pelosi's January 6th Committee to diminish any future campaigns for public office by Trump. President Biden is not only stupid by birth, but he is dangerous as well. He is the reason for increased gas, propane, crude oil prices, and an economy in crisis. Now Biden is draining America's strategic reserve by releasing a million barrels a day for the next several months to try and fix the mess he made. Yet the real answer here is to drill and produce more energy to create a surplus. The Putin wing of the Republican Party, the Putin wing of the media, and those pretending to be America First cannot deny the genocide that Putin, a cold-blooded mass murderer, is waging on Ukraine - this is real Naziism. President Biden must stop being afraid of Putin's nuclear weapons and remember that we have nuclear bombs too. Afterward, Elon Musk might be one of the few individuals that can right the ship at Twitter regarding censorship, free speech, and preventing propaganda. Now President Biden's SEC is going after Musk to force him to disclose his majority stake in Twitter.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
