  "description": "<p>In recent years, fasting has made a lot of headlines. Like many other ways of eating, fasting has been both championed and demonized in popular culture. But what if we didn’t think of fasting as an extreme diet or trend? Instead, what if we considered fasting as a way of returning to our roots and reclaiming our biological processes?<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p>Until recently, fasting in sync with the circadian rhythm is something that humans have done for hundreds of years. Eating exclusively during daylight hours is a natural, innate habit for humans—in fact, it’s how we evolved. Our bodies naturally function in accordance with our intrinsic circadian rhythm, and digestion is an important part of that process. Fasting, specifically circadian fasting is an essential way we can tune into our inherent biological functions and behave in a way that our genes expect.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p>Dr. Amy Shah is here to unpack the power of the circadian rhythm and how it impacts our digestion, hormones, and other biological processes. Dr. Shah is a double board-certified physician who specializes in fasting, balancing hormones, and gut health. Her new book, <em>I’m So Effing Tired</em> offers solutions to beat burnout and optimize energy levels through the power of circadian fasting. On this episode of The Model Health Show, she’s sharing the science and tips you need to tap into your natural energy levels and operate at your highest capacity.
