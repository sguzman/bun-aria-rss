  "description": "<p>We present an implementation of the full electroweak $H+2~\\text{jets}$\nproduction process at hadron colliders in the framework of the\n$\\tt{POWHEG~BOX}$, a public tool for the matching of fixed-order perturbative\ncalculations with parton shower generators. Our implementation allows for the\nsimultaneous description of vector-boson fusion and Higgsstrahlung\ncontributions. NLO-QCD and electroweak corrections are taken into account and\nmatched to QCD and QED showers, respectively. The size of the fixed-order QCD\nand electroweak corrections is found to be moderate, but dependent on the\nconsidered selection cuts. QCD shower effects slightly modify the NLO-QCD\npredictions and are most pronounced for distributions of non-tagging jets. The\nimpact of QED shower effects is small.\n</p>",
