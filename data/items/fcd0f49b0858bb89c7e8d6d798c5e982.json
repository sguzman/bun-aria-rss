  "description": "Legendary actress Kathy Bates has probably lost count of how many awards she has been nominated for and won. But very few people know about her battles with cancer, her family history of suicide attempts, or her own struggles with PTSD and depression. On this episode of Impact Theory with Tom Bilyeu, Kathy Bates talks about gratitude, moments of grace, and the fact that you don’t have to be perfect to be remarkable. Along the way she tells stories of healing and tragedy, life and death, and memorably explains why she always thanks the crew.
