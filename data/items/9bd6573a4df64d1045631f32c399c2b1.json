The gallery has remained a leader of the pack throughout the past 50 years, despite seismic shifts in the art world and market.

Ultimately, the legacy of the gallery will be the artists it has supported, she says: “The gallery will be forgotten. It’s the artists who survive.”</p> <p>For this and more, tune in today to <em>In Other Words</em>.</p> <p>Transcript: <a href= \"https://www.artagencypartners.com/transcript-58-paula-cooper-and-steve-henry/\"> https://www.artagencypartners.com/transcript-58-paula-cooper-and-steve-henry/</a></p> <p>“In Other Words” is a presentation of AAP and Sotheby’s, produced by Audiation.fm.</p>",
