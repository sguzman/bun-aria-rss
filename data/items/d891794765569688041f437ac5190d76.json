Hashimoto’s is the leading cause of hypothyroidism (i.e., an underactive thyroid) in the US, and roughly 14 million people are struggling with this diagnosis. The conventional approach to treating it is based almost entirely on suppressing symptoms with drugs. However, with a Functional Medicine approach, there are so many other steps for treating the thyroid.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>I talk with Dr. George Papanicolaou, Dr. Elizabeth Boham, and Dhru Purohit about why thorough testing is necessary for identifying Hashimoto’s and how lifestyle changes, such as removing gluten, could help to treat this condition.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. George Papanicolaou is a graduate of the Philadelphia College of Osteopathic Medicine and is board certified in Family Medicine from Abington Memorial Hospital.
