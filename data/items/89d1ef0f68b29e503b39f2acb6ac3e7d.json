  "description": "Venture capitalist Tim Draper has doubled down on his Bitcoin price prediction of $250,000 by the end of this year or early next year. However, the billionaire explained why he expects the price of the king crypto (BTC) to soar past his estimate.\n\nDraper explained: “Women control about 80% of retail spending and retailers haven’t yet realized that they can save 2%, and they usually run on very thin margins so that might be like double their profits.
