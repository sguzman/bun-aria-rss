  "description": "<p><p>On Episode 49, the fellas open up with some chatter about their sister podcast Pardon My Take and their new show on ESPN. The boys also dissect what ails a few teams before discussing the Las Vegas Golden Knights inevitable introduction to Hockey Twitter and the Internet Outrage Machine thanks to quoting a movie. Ray Ferraro then joins in for a fun and wide-ranging interview. The scrappy forward who scored 408 goals in 18 hard-nosed NHL seasons discusses his time in Hartford, the favorite stop in his career, the squandered chance in the 1990 Adams Division Semi-Finals vs. the Bruins, scoring 108 goals in juniors, how the Atlanta Thrashers maintained their sanity during a 14-win season, how he got into TV, the 1993 Islanders epic upset over the Penguins, and much more. The boys then answer #AllRightHamilton questions and close with some words about Gord Downie. Ray is a hell of a raconteur so tune in and enjoy.</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
