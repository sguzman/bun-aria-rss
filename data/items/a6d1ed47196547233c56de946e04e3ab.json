  "description": "<p>We have a big double interview today as we talk to Canadian track cyclists Lauriane Genest and Kelsey Mitchell. Lauriane and Kelsey met each other at an RBC Training Ground event several years, and both went on to medal in Tokyo last year. We talk about their meeting on a training bike when neither of them had ever thought of cycling before, their experience of competing against each other and separately in Tokyo, as well as find out what other sports they may have tried out since their first Olympics. They're Canada's new cycling duo, and they bring twice as the entertainment as usual on our latest episode.</p>",
