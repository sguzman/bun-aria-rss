  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, President Biden will commit the US to cut greenhouse gas emissions by 2030. This is an attack on what was the industrial revolution, yet another part of the degrowth movement. Ayn Rand predicted this in her book \"The Return of the Primitive: The Anti-Industrial Revolution.\" Rand surmised that attacking technological progress is an attack on the innovative thought of the individual and limits the unknown and undiscovered. Joe Biden is allowing an attack on capitalism which is actually an attack on liberty because you can't have a free society without it. A plan to reach net-zero greenhouse gasses would destroy so many smoke-stack industries and associated jobs. This is a massive totalitarian affront on our liberty and it's based on crap science. Notice how the left has stopped talking about the Amazon because it's still there producing carbon dioxide which is protein for plants. Environmentalist leftists are part of a religious movement to destroy their own industries and many of them don't even realize it. Later, if Democrats pursue statehood for the District of Colombia then all non-federal areas of the District should be ceded back to the state of Maryland so that they can have a vote. In the past, part of Washington DC was ceded back to Virginia. So, the purpose of having a federal enclave was established in the Constitution because the framers didn't want the Capitol to exist in any state. Afterward, Lt. Gov. Mark Robinson got under Rep. Steve Cohen's skin today as he gave testimony to Rep. Chip Roy. Robinson cited how offensive it is for Congress to suggest that African Americans could survive slavery but not figure out how to get a voter ID card. Finally, Sen. Marsha Blackburn calls in discuss her bill that would force the Biden administration to submit any Iran nuclear agreement, including rejoining the 2015 deal, for Senate consideration as a treaty. \n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
