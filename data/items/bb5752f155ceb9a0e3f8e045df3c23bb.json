  "description": "The Coronavirus Crisis is the first 50 state natural disaster in American history. And while it is certainly not the first for which the federal response was lacking, it may be the worst overall response of an administration to a major crisis in our history. The lies continue. Public confidence continues to erode. Vital supplies from tests to masks to ventilators remain out of reach for many. Coordination is weak. Signs of corruption are brewing. And the President and his team seem to be learning precious little from their errors. So, what's working? Who's succeeding? What's the solution? And how much worse can this get. On this urgently important episode, we discuss with Juliette Kayyem of the Kennedy School at Harvard, Jeremy Konyndyk of the Center for Global Development, both crisis experts, and our own Ryan Goodman of \"Just Security\" and NYU Law School. Don't miss it.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
