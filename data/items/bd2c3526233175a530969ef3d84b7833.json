  "description": "<p>We initiate a systematic study of continuously self-similar (CSS)\ngravitational dynamics in two dimensions, motivated by critical phenomena\nobserved in higher dimensional gravitational theories. We consider CSS\nspacetimes admitting a homothetic Killing vector (HKV) field. For a general\ntwo-dimensional gravitational theory coupled to a dilaton field and Maxwell\nfield, we find that the assumption of continuous self-similarity determines the\nform of the dilaton coupling to the curvature. Certain limits produce two\nimportant classes of models, one of which is closely related to two-dimensional\ntarget space string theory and the other being Liouville gravity. The gauge\nfield is shown to produce a shift in the dilaton potential strength. We\nconsider static black hole solutions and find spacetimes with uncommon\nasymptotic behaviour. We show the vacuum self-similar spacetimes to be special\nlimits of the static solutions. We add matter fields consistent with\nself-similarity (including a certain model of semi-classical gravity) and write\ndown the autonomous ordinary differential equations governing the gravitational\ndynamics. Based on the phenomenon of finite-time blow-up in ODEs, we argue that\nspacetime singularities are generic in our models. We present qualitatively\ndiverse results from analytical and numerical investigations regarding matter\nfield collapse and singularities. We find interesting hints of a Choptuik-like\nscaling law.\n</p>",
