She joined Allison’s family in their search for Allison, which included looking at numerous possible suspects, knocking on doors, excavating land, and speaking to witnesses to yield information. Then, there was an alleged confession that detailed Allison’s death- who was involved, when, and where. But was that story believable or a complete fabrication?</p><p>If you have any information about Allison’s disappearance, please call the Bay County Sheriff’s Office at 850-747-4700.</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p>Doordash- Get 50% off, up to a $20 value, and zero delivery fees.
