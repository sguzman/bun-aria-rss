  "description": "<p>Jack the Ripper. That name can cause one's blood to run cold. No serial killer is as famous as Jack the Ripper. This killer was unique in that he seemed to be the first who reveled in provoking the police. The area where these crimes were committed, Whitechapel, would hold onto its infamous reputation. On this episode we will examine the crimes, talk about the victims, theorize on who the killer may have been and share the hauntings that have plagued Whitechapel ever since.
