  "description": "Happy 4th of July! We're dropping the new episode of The Readheads a few days early because we were all so excited about this months book. In this episode we are recapping and discussing Girls With Bright Futures with a very special guest, Claudia Oshry! She's an honorary Readhead and she read along with us this month so she's joining us for the episode. As always we're talking about the best and worst parts of the book and all of the other books we read this month. The next book is Dana's choice and she chose A Flicker in the Dark by Stacy Willingham. The overall Readheads Rating for Girls With Bright Futures is 4.08.",
