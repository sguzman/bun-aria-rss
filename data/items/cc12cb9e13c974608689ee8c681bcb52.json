Understanding Freire and his influence is therefore paramount to understanding how our education system has been poisoned by Marxist Theory over the last forty years. To put it simply, Freire must be understood as a significant prophet in the Marxist religion, and his faith has been integrated thoroughly into all North American education, to the detriment of all. Join James Lindsay in this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, where he continues through the darker, deeper aspect of Freirean Critical Pedagogy, as he reads through the second half of Henry Giroux's foreword to Freire's 1985 The Politics of Education (https://amzn.to/3s4bQft), which is an explicitly religious book. This is the fourth episode in Lindsay's sprawling Critical Education Theory (Critical Pedagogy) series on the New Discourses Podcast.\n\nSupport New Discourses:\npaypal.me/newdiscourses\nnewdiscourses.locals.com/support\npatreon.com/newdiscourses\nsubscribestar.com/newdiscourses\nyoutube.com/channel/UC9K5PLkj0N_b9JTPdSRwPkg/join\n\nWebsite:\nhttps://newdiscourses.com\n\nFollow:\nfacebook.com/newdiscourses\ntwitter.com/NewDiscourses\ninstagram.com/newdiscourses\nhttps://newdiscourses.locals.com\npinterest.com/newdiscourses\nlinkedin.com/company/newdiscourses\nminds.com/newdiscourses\nreddit.com/r/NewDiscourses\n\nPodcast:\n@newdiscourses\npodcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/new-…es/id1499880546\nbit.ly/NDGooglePodcasts\nopen.spotify.com/show/0HfzDaXI5L4LnJQStFWgZp\nstitcher.com/podcast/new-discourses\n\n© 2022 New Discourses.
