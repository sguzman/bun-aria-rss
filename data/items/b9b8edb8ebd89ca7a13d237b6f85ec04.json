  "description": "<p>Lower manufacturing costs, innovative launch vehicles, miniaturized sub-systems and new sensor technologies have resulted in a surge in the number of satellites orbiting earth. The more than 1,300 small satellites orbiting earth means we can now scan any given location on the planet multiple times per day -- and not just with cameras, but with sensors that measure atmospheric pressure, temperature, and more. This week, Switched On speaks with technology analyst Sarrah Raza about the rapid growth in the industries that make these small satellites, send them to space, and analyze the data they send back.</p><p>This episode is based on a report titled <a href=\"https://www.bnef.com/core/insights/23241\">Tiny Satellites – Space’s Next Frontier</a>.
