  "description": "<p>Modern machine learning is transforming particle physics, faster than we can\nfollow, and bullying its way into our numerical tool box. For young researchers\nit is crucial to stay on top of this development, which means applying\ncutting-edge methods and tools to the full range of LHC physics problems. These\nlecture notes are meant to lead students with basic knowledge of particle\nphysics and significant enthusiasm for machine learning to relevant\napplications as fast as possible. They start with an LHC-specific motivation\nand a non-standard introduction to neural networks and then cover\nclassification, unsupervised classification, generative networks, and inverse\nproblems. Two themes defining much of the discussion are well-defined loss\nfunctions reflecting the problem at hand and uncertainty-aware networks. As\npart of the applications, the notes include some aspects of theoretical LHC\nphysics. All examples are chosen from particle physics publications of the last\nfew years. Given that these notes will be outdated already at the time of\nsubmission, the week of ML4Jets 2022, they will be updated frequently.\n</p>",
