  "description": "<p>In recent years, there’s been a shift in how we think about psychedelics – from drugs of abuse and recreation, to powerful drugs for treating neuropsychiatric conditions such as depression, addiction, and PTSD.  </p><p>But there’s still a lot we don't know about how they work, and how we can maximize their therapeutic benefits while minimizing their adverse side effects. So this episode of Journal Club discusses a method for striking that balance, from a paper published in Nature last month, “<a href=\"https://doi.org/10.1038/s41586-020-3008-z\">A non-hallucinogenic psychedelic analogue with therapeutic potential</a>“... which could represent a major step forward in psychedelic medicine. </p><p>This episode first appeared on Bio Eats World:<br />https://a16z.com/2021/01/21/journal-club-safer-psychedelic/</p>\n",
