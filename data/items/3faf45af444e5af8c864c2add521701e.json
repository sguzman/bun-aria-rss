    "media:description": "i've been playing elden ring for around 90 hours. i have not moved from my seat. i eat, sleep and defecate in the same spot for days. if i move, my hands start shaking because i'm not playing elden ring. if anything else except elden ring is on my monitor, i start punching it out of fear of the unknown. i do not know anything else except elden ring. Thank you From Software. Thank you so much. My life has gotten significantly better since this game has come out. \n\nother stuff:\n♢ TWITCH: https://www.twitch.tv/squizxy\n♢ TWITTER: https://twitter.com/squizxy\n♢ INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/squiz.xy/\n\n#eldenring #fromsoftware #animation",
