  "description": "On Tuesday’s Mark Levin show, some once-conservative voices have become sell-outs and are positioning themselves as critics of President Trump. Trump has stood on the side of liberty and for the Constitution on so many important issues facing our nation. An attack on Trump is an attack on every American who voted for him, yet they revere and protect the so-called whistleblower, Eric Ciaramella. Ciaramella is the new \"blue dress\" of this illegitimate impeachment inquiry designed to malign Trump. What's more, the un-free press works hand-in-glove with the political left-wing and their ilk in media to destroy the Trump Presidency covering little else in their news coverage. Then, imagine what tomorrow's post-hearing headlines will look like. The media will say that those damn Republicans will want to hear from the so-called whistleblower, but Adam Schiff decided that only the Democrats can speak with the anonymous Ciaramella. Only Schiff can decide what witnesses can be called. Only the Democrats can be involved in their concocted impeachment charades. Later, the left has been working for decades on changing ideas, values, and institutions in America and Conservatives have been too slow to recognize and respond to it. In Edward Erler's book on the Founders, he cites Aristotle, \"a radical change in the character of the citizens would be tantamount to a regime change just as surely as a revolution in its political principles.\" If the Democrats take power in the Senate, and the presidency, we can say goodbye to capitalism, national security, and your local police departments.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
