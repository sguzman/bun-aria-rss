  "description": "Akamai's Women's Forum Americas, OHANA and In Reach Employee Resource Groups recently hosted Cross ERG 'Change the Rules' Keynote - Celebration of Black History Month in our Chicago office. We were excited to have notable Michelle Silverthorn, CEO of Inclusion Nation, a company that focuses on improving recruitment, retention, and the promotion of diverse professionals, as the keynote speaker. It is not often that we have an external speaker join us and have the impact Michelle had with her talk on Changing the Rules. Her stories resonated with the audience and her actionable approach was most appreciated.",
