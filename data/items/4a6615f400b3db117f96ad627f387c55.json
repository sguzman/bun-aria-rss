  "description": "<div>In January 1974, 18-year-old Guðmundur Einarsson enjoyed a night out with friends in the town of Hafnarfjordur, Iceland. At the end of the evening, he walked into a wild snowstorm and was never seen again. Ten months later, in November 1974, 32-year-old Geirfinnur Einarsson (no relation) also disappeared from the Icelandic fishing town of Keflavik. In a country with next to no homicide, foul play was considered immediately.  <br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nNarration – <a href=\"https://twitter.com/casefilehost\">Anonymous Host</a>\n</div>\n<div>Research and writing – Jessica Forsayeth</div>\n<div>Creative direction – Milly Raso<br>\nProduction and music – <a href=\"http://mikemigas.com/\">Mike Migas</a>\n</div>\n<div>Music – <a href=\"http://www.andrewjoslynmusic.com/\">Andrew D.B.
