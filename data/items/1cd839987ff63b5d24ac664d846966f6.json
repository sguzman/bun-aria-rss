  "description": "On this episode of The Fred Minnick Show, the alt-blues band Houndmouth joins Fred for some whiskey sipping and lively conversation. Formed in New Albany, Indiana, in 2011, the band consists of Matt Myers, Zak Appleby and Shane Cody. On the show, they talk about touring, 10 years of being headquartered in downtown New Albany, they sip everything from Michter's 10 to 291 Colorado Whiskey and they perform two songs -- one of which is slated to be on their forthcoming new album.\n\nWhiskeys tasted:\nMichter's 10 Year (14:24)\n291 Colorado Whiskey (23:40)\nPenelope Four Grain Bourbon (44:12)\nPeerless Rye (47:00)\nOld Fitzgerald 14 Year Bottled in Bond (55:46)\n\nEPISODE SUMMARY\n\nFred and the members of Houndmouth talk about a wide variety of things, such as:\nFred gives the band a moment to decide whether to perform before drinking the whiskey or after. It is noted that performing pre-whiskey would be a foreign experience; predictably, they choose post-whiskey.\nThere's a quick discussion of thrift stores and haunted dolls.\nThe band is headquartered in an old house in downtown New Albany which sits next to a fire station, making it sometimes difficult to record.\nThey tell the story of how the band name came about, and it is directly related to the fact sound bleeds into the old house.\nFred takes the band through his method of tasting bourbon.\nFred says mindfulness - paying close attention to what you're eating or drinking - can work even for something as mundane as a McDonald's cheeseburger. Talk then turns to chicken sandwiches and later hot chicken. Because it's so freaking good. Fred then somehow waxes eloquent about Tanzanian cashews.\nThe band agrees they've never tasted anything quite like the 291 Colorado Whiskey. Aspen staves will do that. (They loved it.)\nFred talks about some of the many flavors he's encountered in whiskey: Drywall, plastic and even dead cat.\nThe origins of Houndmouth, which first began to take shape in 2011, are explored. Interestingly, each of the original members primarily played guitar, so they were forced to diversify.\nThe band performs a song at around the 37:00 mark.\nFred gets to the Penelope Four Grain and the group already had consumed it. Oops. The Peerless Rye comes out.\nThere is a discussion about the benefits of having a great mother-in-law.\nBefore covid, Houndmouth toured so relentlessly that in one year they played 280 shows.\nThey already drank the Old Fitz as well. As for the overall favorite? Penelope Four Grain was the winner ... which is why they essentially finished it before the show was recorded.\nLook for a new album from Houndmouth this spring.\nThe band performs a song from the forthcoming album at around the 55:00 mark.\n\nRESOURCES\n\nhttps://www.houndmouth.com/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/Houndmouth\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/Houndmouth/\n\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.",
