  "description": "<p>There have been a thousand hot takes about the Facebook Oversight Board, the Supreme Court-like thing Facebook set up to oversee its content moderation. The Board generated so much press coverage when it handed down its decision on Donald Trump’s account that Kaitlyn Tiffany at <em>The Atlantic </em>called the whole circus “<a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/technology/archive/2021/05/facebook-oversight-board-trump-decision-circus/618813/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">like <em>Shark Week, </em>but less scenic</a>.” Everyone weighed in, from Board Members, to <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/05/05/technology/facebook-oversight-board-decision-reaction.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">lawmakers</a>, academics, critics and even <em>Lawfare</em> podcast hosts. But there’s a group we haven’t heard much from: the people at Facebook who are actually responsible for sending cases to the Board and responding to the Board’s policy recommendations. Everyone focuses on the Board Members, but the people at Facebook are the ones that can make the Board experiment actually translate into change—or not. So this week for our Arbiters of Truth series on our online information environment, in light of Facebook’s <a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2021/07/facebooks-first-quarterly-update-on-the-oversight-board/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">first quarterly update</a> on the Board, Evelyn Douek talked with Jennifer Broxmeyer and Rachel Lambert, both of whom work at Facebook on Facebook’s side of the Oversight Board experiment.
