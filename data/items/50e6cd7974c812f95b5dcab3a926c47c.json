  "description": "<div>This week we revisit Sam's conversation with Sir Salman Rushdie, recorded just before the pandemic. <em>‘Things that would have seemed utterly improbable now happen on a daily basis’, </em>Sir Salman Rushdie said to Sam when they spoke in an interview for the Spectator's 10,000th edition. They discuss everything from his latest book <em>Quichotte</em>, to his relationship with his father, who we learn made up the surname 'Rushdie', and how he feels about <em>The Satanic Verses</em> now.</div>\n",
