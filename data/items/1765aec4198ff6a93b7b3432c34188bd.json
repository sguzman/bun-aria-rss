  "description": "In  A Universe from Nothing: Why There is Something Rather than Nothing (Atria, 2012),  Lawrence M. Krauss presents this big idea: something can–and perhaps must–come from nothing. That something is, well, everything–you, me, and the entire universe. If that doesn’t get your attention, nothing will. Of course, as Lawrence explains, nothing usually turns out on close inspection to be something. Listen in and find out how. Lawrence and I also discussed the relationship between science (especially physics) and religion, and in particular the question “What came before that?” and whether said question has any meaning at all. No matter what you believe, I’m sure you’ll find what Lawrence has to say of great interest.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
