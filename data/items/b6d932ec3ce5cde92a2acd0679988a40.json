She got into her car and drove in the direction of home. She has never been seen again. Her car was found soon after and it appeared there was a strange vehicular accident. Her car was smashed backwards into an abandoned, creepy old farmhouse. The old house has a violent history. What happened to the driver of that car and was this even really a car accident at all? Did a terrible crime take place there instead? Did this event lead to the abduction of this girl? Someone out there knows something. This week we discuss the disappearance of Brianna Maitland.
