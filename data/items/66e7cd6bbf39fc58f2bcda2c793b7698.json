Customers can sign up today for our new Business 2 Gig product for $250 a month. (Yep, that’s the same price we offered SMB 1000 for previously — same low price, twice the download speed). <br /><br />Business 2 Gig customers get up to 2000 mbps download and up to 1000 mbps upload, along with Wifi 6 with mesh capability and up to two mesh extenders based on the needs of their business. Our flagship Business 1 Gig remains a great option for business customers as well, now at only $100 a month, providing fast, reliable internet at an even more affordable price. <br /><br />Additionally, we know that phone service is integral to business operation. That’s why we’re pleased to &nbsp; offer Google Fiber Business customers the opportunity to sign up for <a href=\"https://www.dialpad.com/dp/google-fiber-landing-page/?promo=GFIBER25&amp;utm_campaign=google-fiber&amp;amp_device_id=eQqWhBBFqelZ8cEauhZ3ss\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\">Dialpad’s business phone service at a 25% discount</a>.  Dialpad customers benefit from unified business and customer communications, including a cloud business phone system, text and team messaging, video meetings and the world’s most advanced AI contact center — all in one app. <br /><br />Existing Google Fiber business customers are eligible for the new pricing and products — they just need <a href=\"https://fiber.google.com/myfiber/\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\">to log in to their account</a> to upgrade or contact <a href=\"https://fiber.google.com/support/\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\">customer service</a> to make the necessary changes. For those who upgrade to Business 2 Gig, our installers will come out to set up the new equipment. <br /><br />Business 2 Gig is available to any business address in any Google Fiber service area.  <a href=\"https://fiber.google.com/business/\" style=\"text-decoration-line: none;\">Sign up today</a> to see where truly fast, affordable internet can take your business! <br /><br />Posted by Bill Mosher, General Manager, Google Fiber Business <br /><br /><img src=\"https://lh6.googleusercontent.com/CA_gB0UD4MOTvHRgJY0bmRlVA7B1Vs-NyIkJ6zK7hVFgSJak7meF8jNSci-uIGszFnM2haLzb77R708BwTTqjygM6cg-6nySH7QxP--flGAE6S4TVG2Yw7smFtwm4EcoQ_ppCC_XVRHF1d3Z2OY-Ykc1A-mTPt-v7mso-lh0JDUOUGpI=w113\" /><br /><br /><br /><br /><br />",
