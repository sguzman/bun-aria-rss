To discuss what the Wuhan virus could mean for markets, Dave Lafferty, chief market strategist at Natixis Investment Managers, and Ye Xie, a contributor to Bloomberg’s Markets Live blog, join the “What Goes Up” podcast.</p><p>Some highlights from Natixis’ Lafferty:</p><p>\"There’s always sort of two phases: there’s the knee-jerk sort of risk-off, markets go down 1 percent, 2 percent, 3 percent, something like that, and then there’s a waiting period where we find out if it’s actually a more systemic problem. By and large in history, policy makers have gotten their arms around it, market tends to rally back.\"</p><p>\"The thing that worries me is that there’s so much optimism priced in, and people are worried about valuation. But valuation, in and of itself, isn’t a catalyst. So in that vacuum, people tend to look for catalysts and maybe some type of epidemic or pandemic becomes the excuse they’ve been looking for to either profit-take or sell down assets that they think are expensive. So I don’t think it’s necessarily the thing that makes or breaks the market, but I would agree at these valuations, with the way the market has run, it does make for kind of a convenient excuse to take a little profit here.\"</p><p>Mentioned in this podcast:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-21/-sharp-and-short-lived-the-impact-of-health-scares-on-markets\">‘Sharp and Short-Lived’: The Impact of Health Scares on Markets</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-23/sars-lessons-don-t-apply-markets-ponder-threat-from-china-virus\">Markets Upset From China Virus Is Only Getting Larger</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/news/articles/2020-01-17/extreme-valuation-cases-wanted-for-a-red-hot-rally-in-equities\">Extreme Valuation Cases Wanted for a Red-Hot Rally in Equities</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
