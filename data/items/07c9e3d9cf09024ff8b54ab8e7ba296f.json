  "description": "<p>(Recorded September 2021) British documentarian Lucy Walker is asking big questions with her latest film, <em>Bring Your Own Brigade</em>. Specifically, why are there more catastrophic wildfires worldwide, and what could mitigate the destruction? Her gripping film focuses on real people impacted by two 2018 California wildfires, “The Camp Fire,” which killed 85 and nearly destroyed the town of Paradise, and “The Woolsey Fire,” which devastated parts of Malibu. Lucy’s camera takes you from the horror of people struggling to escape the wildfires to disbelief as residents reject steps that could limit future destruction. Lucy Walker’s other films include <em>The Crash Reel</em>, <em>Countdown to Zero</em>, <em>Waste Land</em>, <em>Blindsight</em>, and <em>Devil’s Playground</em>. </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
