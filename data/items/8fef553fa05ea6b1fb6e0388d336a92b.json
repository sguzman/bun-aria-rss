  "description": "<p>This week on <em>Radio Cherry Bombe</em>, host Julia Turshen welcomes Erin McKenna of Babycakes Bakery and Brooks Headley of Del Posto Restaurant in NYC. Starting off the show, Erin shares her story with Julia about how she began to bake, specifically gluten free, treats, and now has bakery locations in NYC, LA, and Orlando. Similarly, Brooks, the Executive Pastry Chef at Del Posto, recalls his background and how he found himself working in one of the best restaurants in the city. Both guests relate on the trials and tribulations of work in the culinary realm as well as the differences between being hands-on with their food versus managing employees. Letting others help with the work is something that the chefs agree is a necessity for success. After the break, Julia chats with the guests about their support systems as well as Brooks’ recent book, Fancy Desserts. Julia also asks what we can expect from both in the future before signing off with the <em>Radio Cherry Bombe</em> rapid fire quiz!
