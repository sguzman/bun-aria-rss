  "description": "<p>For <strong>Life on Purpose Episode #79</strong>, my guest is author and women’s leadership expert <strong>Tara Mohr</strong>, who gives women <em>(and the men in her audience/community)</em> the practical skills to voice and implement the changes they want to see—in themselves and in the world.</p> <p><strong>Tara</strong> joined me for a great conversation on her new book <em><strong>Playing Big: Practical Wisdom for Women Who Want to Speak Up, Create</strong></em>, and Lead, which was named a best book of the year by Apple’s iBooks. It provides real, practical tools to help women quiet self-doubt, identify their callings, “unhook” from praise and criticism, unlearn counterproductive \"good girl\" habits, and begin taking bold action.</p> <p><em>“How did Playing Big come to be? I felt like all around me, I saw women playing small. Brilliant women with fabulous ideas, provocative questions, visions for how the world could be different and better. But those ideas and visions and questions weren't being voiced. And I was very attuned to that because I was struggling with that myself.</em></p> <p><em>I sent out a survey and asked my readers and asked them, 'What's the biggest challenge in your life?' and I listed a bunch of the challenges that we typically think loom so large in women's lives. But because of what I'd seen again and again, I added one more challenge to the list, 'I'm playing small.' When the survey responses came back, 'I'm playing small' was what the most women deemed the biggest challenge in their lives.\"</em></p> <p>About: <strong>Tara Mohr</strong> is an expert on women’s leadership and well-being.
