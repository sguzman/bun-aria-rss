They discuss the new Louis CK stand up special. After 4 weeks in quarantine, the guys go over what they miss most about bars. Voicemails include: Covering Up a Crime, Sex Equivalent, and Spiderman or Orgasms. \n\nCory G (@corygfitness) joined the show. He tells us about how he used to be an actual coal miner, how he started his first gym, and what we can do to get in shape while in quarantine. \n\nJo Koy returns to the show. We discuss being quarantined with family, how coronavirus has effected the comedy scene, and Jo tells us about a heartwarming, cathartic moment he had with Tiffany Haddish at one of his recent arena shows.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
