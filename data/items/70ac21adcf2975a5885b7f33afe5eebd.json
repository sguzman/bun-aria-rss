  "itunes:summary": "Over the last two decades, Clare Cooper has brought together thousands of people to collaborate on community initiatives, creative approaches to governance, collaborative composition, speculative design, and critical listening.\n\nHere, in line with Jim Denley’s profile on Clare, published on Disclaimer, Clare talks through memories of sound and listening, the beginnings of playing the harp and guzheng, futuring, and the multitude of organising and improvising that has been present throughout her career. Spanning disciplines, countries and communities, Clare’s work is rooted in the sociability of improvisation and it’s capacity to encourage compassion and radical acts of trust.\n\nhttps://disclaimer.org.au/contents/the-test-of-time-clare-crim-cooper\n\nImage: Keelan O'Hehir\n\nFinancial support from patrons at any level has a resounding impact on our work. You can support Liquid Architecture’s weekly podcast and our online journal Disclaimer, for new thinking and writing on listening and sound through a Patreon subscription, for as little as $5 a month. \n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/liquidarchitecture\n\nFor the past 20 years, Liquid Architecture has been Australia’s leading organisation for artists working with sound and listening. LA investigates the sounds themselves, but also the ideas communicated about, and the meaning of, sound and listening.",
