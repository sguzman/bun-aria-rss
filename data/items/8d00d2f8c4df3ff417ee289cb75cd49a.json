  "description": "Faith is a loaded word in some circles, but in this episode, Elizabeth Mattis Namgyel makes her case for it - in ways that might surprise you. We also discuss: what she means by the phrase \"being realistic,\" the power of exploring open questions, and how sitting like a log is the new activism. She's been practicing for 35 years in the Tibetan tradition. She is the retreat master of Samten Ling in Crestone, Colorado and has spent over six years in silent retreat. She’s the author of The Power of an Open Question and The Logic of Faith, and host of the new podcast Open Question.  \nWhere to find Elizabeth Mattis Namgyel online: \nWebsite: https://www.elizabethmattisnamgyel.com/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/EMattisNamgyel\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/ElizabethMattisNamgyel/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/elizabethmattisnamgyel/ \nBooks: The Power of an Open Question - https://www.elizabethmattisnamgyel.com/the-power-of-an-open-question\nThe Logic of Faith - https://www.elizabethmattisnamgyel.com/the-logic-of-faith \nOther Resources Mentioned: Thinley Norbu Rinpoche - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Thinley_Norbu\nFaith by Sharon Salzberg - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00AG0BRCE/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1 \nShantideva - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shantideva\nMahayana - https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Mahayana\nThe Way of the Bodhisattva - https://www.amazon.com/dp/B006L8SE58/ref=dp-kindle-redirect?_encoding=UTF8&btkr=1 Dzigar\nKongtrul Rinpoche - https://www.mangalashribhuti.org/VDKR\nOpen Question podcast - https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/open-question/id1507249383 \nAdditional Resources:\nTen Percent Happier Live: https://tenpercent.com/live\nCoronavirus Sanity Guide: https://www.tenpercent.com/coronavirussanityguide\nFree App access for Frontline Workers: https://tenpercent.com/care \nFull Shownotes: https://www.tenpercent.com/podcast-episode/elizabeth-mattis-namgyel-261\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
