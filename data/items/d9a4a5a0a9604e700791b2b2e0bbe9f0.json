  "description": "<p>In this episode, the guys wrap up their discussion on the Kingdom of God. The biblical story ultimately becomes a clash between God’s Kingdom and human kingdoms. God responds to this rebellion throughout the Old Testament, but the good news of Jesus is that he came to bring the Kingdom again. What does this mean for us as followers of Jesus?</p>\n<p>In the first part of the episode (02:36-16:40), Tim and Jon talk about Jesus as King. What does it look like for Jesus to invite his followers to live under his reign in the upside-down Kingdom?</p>\n<p>In the last part of the episode (16:55-22:48), the guys continue to unpack this idea of the “now and not yet” Kingdom they introduced last time. There is incredible hope in the reality of God’s Kingdom. Death, injustice, and human failure are not the way the story ends! But joining in God’s Kingdom means resisting the kingdoms of the world and allowing Jesus to fully reign.</p>\n<p>Video:<br />\nThis episode is designed to accompany our video called, “Gospel of the Kingdom.\" You can view it on our youtube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=xmFPS0f-kzs</p>\n<p>Book References:<br />\nHow God Became King by N.T.
