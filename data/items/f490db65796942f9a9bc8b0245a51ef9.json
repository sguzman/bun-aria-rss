  "description": "<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Credit scores are these three digit snapshots — usually a number between 300 and 850 — that represent a borrower&#8217;s risk of default. They&#8217;re calculated by algorithms that use a borrower&#8217;s credit data, like the history of their credit payments, the amount of debt they owe, how long they&#8217;ve owned credit cards and more. Much of that data is collected and maintained by the three big credit bureaus, Equifax, Experian and TransUnion. It&#8217;s a system that scores millions of Americans. But critics say the system doesn&#8217;t serve consumers who prioritize paying for things in cash or don&#8217;t have enough credit accounts. In this episode, &#8220;Marketplace Tech&#8221; producer Daniel Shin explores how not having enough credit data to feed the algorithm can hurt a consumer&#8217;s chances of getting a loan or a mortgage.</p>\n<p>Your donation powers the journalism you rely on. <em><a href=\"https://support.marketplace.org/tech-sn\">Give today to support &#8220;Marketplace Tech.&#8221;</a></em></p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p>\n",
