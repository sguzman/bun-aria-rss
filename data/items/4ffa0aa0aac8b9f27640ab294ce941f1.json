  "title": "ðŸ“¬ Mailbag: How underratedÂ is Patrick Mahomes' contract? Who will win the AFC North? Who'd be the best head coach: Brady, Manning or Rodgers? (Football 4/6)",
  "description": "The Pick Six Mailbag is back for a Tuesday edition with questions pouring in. Will Brinson is joined by Ryan Wilson and John Breech to answer questions from the listeners. We applauded the Chiefs for the terms of Patrick Mahomes' contract last year, but could it go down as one of the best deals ever? Alright Breech, you're on the clock...What would you do if the Bengals had the #1 overall pick this year after taking Joe Burrow #1 last year? We examine another hypothetical: if Matthew Stafford wins a Super Bowl with the Rams, which team would he enter the Hall of Fame for? What if the NBA's \"Stepien Rule\" was transferred to football? Those answers and way more including a positive spin on the Steelers, which legendary QBs would make the best coaches, if we'll ever see a legitimate 2-QB system in the NFL and what happens to fan bases when teams move?\n\n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts.Â \nYou can listen to Pick Six on your smart speakers!
