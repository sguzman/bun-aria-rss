  "description": "<p>Pandemics and plagues have been a part of our human history. No matter how developed the world becomes, a very microscopic bug can cause society to fall into collapse and kill millions of people. We are now living through an unprecedented moment in history with the Covid-19 Pandemic. There have been many of these pandemics in recent human history and one of the worst was the Spanish Flu Pandemic of 1918. This form of influenza was believed to have infected a third of the world's population at the time and lead to the deaths of 50 million people. The Moment in Oddity was suggested by Quoylette and features railworkers discovering a 14th Century cave and This Month in History features the Civil Rights Bill of 1866 passing.
