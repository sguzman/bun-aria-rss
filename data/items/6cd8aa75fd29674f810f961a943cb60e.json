  "description": "In this episode, Sharon is joined by writer and author Patrick Radden Keefe, whose new book, Rogues, tells twelve stories of people with big personalities–the grifters, the rebels, the crooks, the crime families, and the people who don’t play by the rules. Patrick talks about how he researches his larger-than-life stories, and gives us a few teasers, like what it was like to interview a woman who is in the Witness Protection Program after testifying against her own brother, and how deeply he dove into the world of wine fraud and revenge. Patrick is fascinated by the choices people make, and what it takes to get inside their minds where they justify their actions, and perhaps even consider themselves the hero of their own stories.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
