  "description": "<p>Analytical approaches in models of opinion formation have been extensively\nstudied either for an opinion represented as a discrete or a continuous\nvariable. In this paper, we analyze a model which combines both approaches. The\nstate of an agent is represented with an internal continuous variable (the\nleaning or propensity), that leads to a discrete public opinion: pro, against\nor neutral. This model can be described by a set of master equations which are\na nonlinear coupled system of first order differential equations of hyperbolic\ntype including non-local terms and non-local boundary conditions, which can't\nbe solved analytically. We developed an approximation to tackle this difficulty\nby deriving a set of master equations for the dynamics of the average leaning\nof agents with the same opinion, under the hypothesis of a time scale\nseparation in the dynamics of the variables. We show that this simplified model\naccurately predicts the expected transition between a neutral consensus and a\nbi-polarized state, and also gives an excellent approximation for the dynamics\nof the average leaning of agents with the same opinion, even when the time\nseparation scale hypothesis is not completely fulfilled.\n</p>",
