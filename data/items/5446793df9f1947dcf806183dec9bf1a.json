  "description": "<p>Personal development comes in many forms. Whether you invest your time in learning from books and podcasts, or cultivate habits like journaling or meditating, there are incredible benefits to making an effort to become a better person.</p> <p>But sometimes, growth isn’t about changing yourself, but instead channeling the most innate and authentic aspects inside of you, and finding the courage to share those things with the world.
