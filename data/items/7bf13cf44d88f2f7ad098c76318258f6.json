  "description": "This is the tale of one woman's journey of growing a community-supported farm from earth to plate. In 1995 Angela Tedesco bought a twenty-acre farm with the goal of growing food for her community, and for seventeen years she fed up to 180 families. Finding Turtle Farm: My Twenty-Acre Adventure in Community-Supported Agriculture (U Minnesota Press, 2022) is the story behind that incredible work, chronicling all the ups and downs of navigating grass-roots organic agriculture in its nascent era. From soil tests to invasive pests (and neighbors), she covers it all - but first and foremost this book is a story of connection, education, and the growth of a thriving local food system. Also included are suggestions of delicious, seasonal varieties of produce as well as recipes to whet your palate. Finding Turtle Farm is a beautiful memoir of food, farming, and one woman who deeply connected with the importance of what goes on our plate, why, and how.\nLiz Barrett is currently history PhDing at Lehigh University. CSA Farmer, mother of 3, and veteran of the USMC. Lives in suburban Philadelphia where she reads and writes a lot, and really likes old stuff. On Twitter: @lizcantlose.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
