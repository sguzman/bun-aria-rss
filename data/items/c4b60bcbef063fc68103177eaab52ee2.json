  "description": "Welcome back to Frankly Speaking. There are a lot of myths surrounding hedge funds, particularly how much yield they create vs. how much it costs you to invest in them. Today I debunk some of those myths, and remind you of the risks vs. rewards of hedge funds. Remember, the better they do, the more risk they take with your money. I also discuss some big changes coming to Curzio Research. We’re getting ready to unveil some exciting new products… and share some special offers with our subscribers. On today’s episode, I also stress the importance of ignoring the market noise. Brexit... tariffs... it doesn’t matter. You can always ride these waves with proper portfolio management. SHOWNOTES: 0:51 – Listener question from Max: Are we seeing a fundamental shift in the hedge fund industry? 4:26 - Hedge fund pricing 9:10 - Hedge funds are encouraged to take more risk with your money. 19:09 - Listener questions from Kurt: Is Briefing.com a substitute for those who can’t afford Capital IQ? Will Curzio Research bundle products? 27:20 - Listener feedback from Jack: I stopped out of one of our Curzio stocks. Should I keep it on the radar for a future position?   30:24 - Ignoring market noise 31:25 - Portfolio management 35:43 - Listener question from Bruce: If returns on REITs are so high, why isn’t everyone flocking to them? What’s the catch?",
