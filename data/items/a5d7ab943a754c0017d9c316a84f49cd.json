  "description": "<ul>\n<li>This week, to celebrate a new term on September 1, we're rating every professor of Hogwarts School!</li>\n<li>How do the DADA professors measure up with one another on quality and on difficulty? We offer individual grades to help us compare them all.</li>\n<li>How about Potions? Is Slughorn a higher quality instructor than Snape?</li>\n<li>We all have high marks for McGonagall, but what about Dumbledore, who we saw teach in Fantastic Beasts?</li>\n<li>We set a Seer against a Centaur and wrap up with Charms, Herbology, and History of Magic.</li>\n<li>Finally, a shout-out to the non-professor teachers of Harry, like Arthur Weasley.</li>\n<li>We confirm our suspicions with MuggleCast's <a href=\"https://www.mugglecast.com/who-are-the-most-effective-professors-at-hogwarts-vote-now/\">listener poll</a> results</li>\n<li>Quizzitch: How many Podcast Awards has MuggleCast received?</li>\n<li>You can join our community at <a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/mugglecast\">Patreon.com/MuggleCast</a> and receive magical benefits, including Bonus MuggleCast!
