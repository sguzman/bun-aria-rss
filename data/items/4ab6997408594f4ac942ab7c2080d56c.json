  "description": "The volatile start to 2021—with some heavily-shorted stocks unexpectedly skyrocketing in late January—seemed to have subsided. But with some of these stocks again on the rise, we ask what factors caused this volatility, how likely it is to repeat, what could prevent this, and what it signals about, or for, markets. Allison Nathan, creator and editor of the firm’s Top of Mind report, turns to former SEC Chair Arthur Levitt, Wellington’s Owen Lamont, and Goldman Sachs’ co-head of Global Prime Services, Kevin Kelly, for answers.",
