    "media:description": "Separation techniques are important in chemistry, and they won't always be as easy as filtration. Sometimes we need to separate two compounds that are dissolved in the same solution. Often we can take advantage of a difference in solubility or reactivity to perform an extraction. This is where one component is pulled into another solvent that is immiscible with the first, and we can separate the two layers using a separatory funnel. There is a lot to learn to do this efficiently, so let's get a closer look at how to perform this technique!\n\nVisit Thermo Fischer Scientific for all your laboratory needs: https://www.thermofisher.com/lab-chemicals\n\nFollow Jamal Muhoza on social media: https://linktr.ee/dr_Jamal\n\nWatch the whole Chemistry Laboratory Techniques playlist: http://bit.ly/ProfDaveChemLab\n\nGeneral Chemistry Tutorials: http://bit.ly/ProfDaveGenChem\nOrganic Chemistry Tutorials: http://bit.ly/ProfDaveOrgChem\nBiochemistry Tutorials: http://bit.ly/ProfDaveBiochem\nBiology Tutorials: http://bit.ly/ProfDaveBio\nClassical Physics Tutorials: http://bit.ly/ProfDavePhysics1\nModern Physics Tutorials: http://bit.ly/ProfDavePhysics2\nMathematics Tutorials: http://bit.ly/ProfDaveMath\n\nEMAIL► ProfessorDaveExplains@gmail.com\nPATREON► http://patreon.com/ProfessorDaveExplains\n\nCheck out \"Is This Wi-Fi Organic?\", my book on disarming pseudoscience!\nAmazon: https://amzn.to/2HtNpVH\nBookshop: https://bit.ly/39cKADM\n&#13;Barnes and Noble: https://bit.ly/3pUjmrn \nBook Depository: http://bit.ly/3aOVDlT",
