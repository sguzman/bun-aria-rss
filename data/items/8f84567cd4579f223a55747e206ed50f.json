  "title": "#230: The Secrets, Tactics, and Creative Processes of High Performers and Achievers -- Debbie Millman",
  "description": "<p>This is round two for Debbie Millman, whose first interview on this show quickly became one of the most downloaded episodes of all time (listen to it here). Graphic Design USA&nbsp;has named Debbie Millman (@debbiemillman) \"one of the most influential designers working today.\" She is also the founder and host of Design Matters, the world's first and longest-running podcast about design, where she's interviewed nearly 300 design luminaries and cultural commentators including Massimo Vignelli and Milton Glaser. Debbie's done it all. Her artwork has been exhibited around the world. She's designed everything from wrapping paper to beach towels, greeting cards to playing cards, notebooks to t-shirts, and Star Wars merchandise to global Burger King rebrands. Debbie is the President Emeritus of AIGA (one of only five women to hold the position in the organization's one-hundred-year history), the editorial and creative director of Print magazine, and the author of six books. In 2009, Debbie co-founded (with&nbsp;Steven Heller) the world's first masters program in branding at the School of Visual Arts in New York City, which has received international acclaim. This time around, Debbie answers the most popular questions submitted by you, the listeners. Topics include: How to turn down stability for opportunity. How Debbie made the leap and continues to try new things. How to outsmart the competition in any job. The future of graphic design. Debbie's own personal creative process. The most valuable lessons Debbie has learned about designing an ideal life for herself. Here's Debbie Millman's round two. Enjoy! Show notes and links for this episode can be found at www.fourhourworkweek.com/podcast. This podcast is brought to you by 99Designs, the world's largest marketplace of graphic designers. I have used them for years to create some amazing designs. When your business needs a logo, website design, business card, or anything you can imagine, check out 99Designs. I used them to rapid prototype the cover for The 4-Hour Body, and I've also had them help with display advertising and illustrations. If you want a more personalized approach, I recommend their 1-on-1 service, which is non-spec. You get original designs from designers around the world. The best part? You provide your feedback, and then you end up with a product that you're happy with or your money back. Click this link and get a free $99 upgrade. Give it a test run... This podcast is also brought to you by Wealthfront. Wealthfront is the future of financial advice. It's become especially popular among my friends in Silicon Valley and across the country because it provides the same high-end financial advice that the best private wealth managers deliver to the ultra wealthy -- but for any account size, at a fraction of the cost. Wealthfront monitors your portfolio every day across more than a dozen asset classes to find opportunities for rebalancing and harvesting tax losses, and now manages more than $5B in assets. Unlike old-fashioned private wealth managers, Wealthfront is powered by innovative technology, making it the most tax-efficient, low-cost, hassle-free way to invest. Go to wealthfront.com/tim to take the risk assessment quiz, which only takes 2-5 minutes, and it'll show you -- for free -- exactly the portfolio it would recommend. If you want to just take the advice and do it yourself, you can. Or, as I would, you can set it and forget it. Well worth a few minutes: wealthfront.com/tim. As a Tim Ferriss Show listener, you'll get your first $15,000 managed for free if you decide to go with its services.&nbsp;</p><p>***</p><p><strong>If you enjoy the podcast, would you please consider&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-tim-ferriss-show/id863897795?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>leaving a short&nbsp;review&nbsp;on Apple Podcasts</strong></a><strong>/iTunes?</strong>&nbsp;It takes less than 60 seconds, and it really makes a difference in helping to convince hard-to-get guests.
