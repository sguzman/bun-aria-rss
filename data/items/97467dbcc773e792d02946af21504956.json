  "description": "<p>Trading our time for money will only get us so far. So many of us are programmed to believe that we have to allocate a large percentage of our time to making money in order to ever consider retirement. Grant Sabatier, this week’s $Pro, is here to say otherwise. Grant wants to disrupt the linear model where time equals money by arguing that our time is actually much more valuable than money. Listen as Grant shares his thoughts on our inability to reclaim lost time, and as we discuss what steps we can take to change the belief: time is money.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Tritonia Gose with Pineapple & Lemon by Creature Comforts which you can find and learn all about on Untappd.
