    "media:description": "Blindfolded archery is insanely difficult and requires a huge amount of training, for years back I would think it was impossible !\nBut with years of full-time archery then impossible things become possible.\n\nMany historical archers did trick archery and there are quite a few descriptions of shots without looking.\n\nText and speak Antony Cummins\nwww.youtube.com/c/AntonyCummins\n\nMathias Fullerton who shoots compound bow in video and is No. 2 on the world ranking list, we are in the same archery club, Lyngby Bueskyttelaug and and even though it is very different archery we sometimes train together.\nhttps://www.instagram.com/mathiasfullerton/\n\n\nAre these just lucky shots?\nAll luck requires a lot of preparation and also here.\nNone of these shots I can do every time, but all the tricks in this video are tricks I have done several times.\nMost of the video was filmed in a large sports hall and here is filmed 2 days to get good shots, that were also filmed well.\n\n0:50 shoot and move, double shoot, is definitely the hardest trick,  I first practiced many times where I watched while I did.\n\nLars",
