  "description": "In this episode, I discuss ways to set up your workspace to optimize productivity, focus and creativity. I discuss how to adjust light, physically arrange your work environment, and leverage body posture to enhance productivity. Additionally, I explore how to shift your work environment for particular types of tasks. Moreover, I review the role of body movement in the workspace. I also discuss sound-based tools that can either enhance or diminish cognitive functioning (the ability to focus on deep work). I describe a particular frequency of binaural beats that studies show can be used to enhance memory and recall. This episode covers quality peer-reviewed findings practical tools anyone can use, regardless of budget, in order to optimize their workspace to achieve heightened levels of productivity, increased alertness and focus, and creativity.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Arranging Environment for Focus\n(00:02:40) Sponsors\n(00:07:55) How to Increase Focus\n(00:10:02) Lighting Your Work in Phase 1\n(00:16:00) Lighting Your Work in Phase 2\n(00:19:45) Lighting Your Work in Phase 3\n(00:24:17) Where to Look While You Work\n(00:28:02) Arranging Your Environment\n(00:31:24) Body Posture\n(00:34:22) How Long to Do Deep Work\n(00:36:50) Set the Right Visual Window Size\n(00:42:15) 45 min / 5 min Rule\n(00:44:23) The Cathedral Effect: Analytic vs Creative Work\n(00:55:50) Leveraging Background Noise\n(01:02:20) Binaural Beats for Work\n(01:06:38) The Best Binaural Frequency for Work\n(01:11:17) How Binaural Beats Increase Focus\n(01:13:56) Minimizing Interruptions\n(01:20:01) Sit or Stand, or Both?\n(01:25:18) Movement in the Workspace\n(01:31:00) Summary & Shifting Work Environments\n(01:39:36) Zero-Cost Support, Sponsors, Instagram, Twitter, Supplements\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",
