  "description": "<p>JonBenet Ramsey. It's been over twenty years since the six-year-old was found murdered in her Boulder, Colorado home and ever since, investigators and the general public alike have been wondering who killed her? Was it an intruder? Some deranged pedophile? Someone wanting money from her rich parents? Or was it a family member? Did her nine-year-old brother kill her? Did her father? Her mother? Some combination of the three? And - why has the public been SO fascinated with her death for so long? We look into a lot of questions and come up with as many answers as this topic will allow, today, on Timesuck.</p>\n<p>My new horror podcast <strong>Scared to Death</strong> is ALIVE!
