  "description": "<p>Las Cultch gets a little spooky on this episode as Matt and sexual handlebar mustache icon Bowen are honest about and fully explore their addictions to social media. Ultimately, it's pretty evil, huh? The boys discuss how the social media landscape has changed over the last decade from a place of opportunity and exchange to a \"zoo with no enclosures\" and detail how it's brought out the worst in themselves and others at times. Also, an examination of shit-talk culture as a whole, the scary ads on Las Culturistas, 73 Questions culture, how Mitch McConnell looks like the walking dead, Bacon Egg and Cheese culture, the drama around pumpkin spice and a full review and discussion of Borat: Subsequent Moviefilm, a cultural moment in time that reveals a star in Maria Bakalova and a damn creep in Miss Rudy Giuliani. Matt and Bow are giving you a hug if you're having a hard time right now. We're all in this together and we'll GET through this together!
