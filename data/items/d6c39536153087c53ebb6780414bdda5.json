Despite a career filled with personal and professional turmoil, Marianne Faithfull has always managed to find her footing. Last year, just as Europe went into quarantine, Marianne started recording a series of spoken word renditions of 19th Century Romantic poems scored by Brian Eno, Nick Cave and her longtime collaborator, Warren Ellis. Resulting in a moving new album, <em>She Walks In Beauty.</em></p><p>On today’s episode, Bruce Headlam talks to Marianne Faithfull about how contracting COVID has impacted her work.
