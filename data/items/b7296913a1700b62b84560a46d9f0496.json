  "description": "I want to remind you today to spend your time investing in your future, not in the past. Investing in the past is when you relive your pains and disappointments, focusing on who hurt you, what didn’t work out, and the mistakes you’ve made. That’s a waste of time and energy. You can’t do anything about what happened in your past—it’s over with. But you can do something about today. When you focus on what you can change, and not on what you can’t change, that is a good investment in the future.<p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
