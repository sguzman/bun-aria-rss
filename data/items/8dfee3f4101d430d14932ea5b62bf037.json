  "description": "<p>Welcome to the Holidays, darling. Day 1 of our 12 episode series explores the fast food kingdom with those golden arches. Las Culturistas agree; \"This was a day of cultural history, this gift.\" The girls discuss why McDonald's is culturally significant, how it relates to their stupid lives, and play Marry, Fuck, Kill with figures within the McDonald's canon. Do YOU think they should give two hash browns instead of one with McDonald's breakfast? Do you have a go-to meal or do you shake it up each time, order-wise? If you don't listen to this episode? Precious one, you're without. </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
