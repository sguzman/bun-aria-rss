  "description": "<p>Mari Andrew is what I’d call a flaneur, she navigates the world in search of moments of discovery, wonder, serendipity and connection. That novelty often drops her into those flickering moments of aliveness - that is her muse. It’s found an expression in the form of beloved illustrations and words on her Instagram account with a community of more than 1M people and her first book. But these last 4 or 5 years have led Mari into entire seasons of deep struggle, reflection, and, ultimately, revelation that’s taken her from park benches in New York’s East Village to hospital wards in Spain and random alleys in Rio.&nbsp;</p><p>In her new book, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3bi0NIJ\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>My Inner Sky: On Embracing Day, Night, and All the Times in Between</em></a><em> (</em>https://amzn.to/3bi0NIJ), Mari shares some of these moments, from an illness that temporarily paralyzed her in a foreign country to finding home within herself again and seeing the world anew.
