  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, Marxism is fascism for the elite dressed up as a people's movement. The Biden Administration and democrats are destroying this country and they're trying to raise taxes and run out the clock because they realize that they may lose some power in the midterms. President Biden is an autocrat that is implementing the neo-Marxist agenda of the radical left-wing of his party. Spending trillions of dollars and working to make permanent the changes they've made in the name of the coronavirus. America will pay a price for flooding the border zone with massive amounts of people as we erroneously attempt to spend our way into prosperity through the American Rescue Plan. This is about the United States of the Democrat Party, not the United States of America. Then, a recent Levin surge to stop Al Sharpton's propaganda has succeeded and your calls to Joe Manchin helped to oppose passing the huge bill on party lines. Biden now says that he is willing to break the bill into small bills to get it passed. Later, Economist Steve Moore joins the show to discuss Biden's horrendous infrastructure plan. Moore highlighted that the way Biden's plan is being presented isn't true and it's a clear display of big government in action. Moore says all of this absurd spending will lead to a crisis if the public doesn't rise up in another Tea Party movement. Afterward, Victor David Hanson calls in to discuss the detriment that inflation would have on the American economy as a result of Biden's atrocious tax increases and spending bills. Hanson remarked that Democrats reject the need for popular support from the people in favor of using raw power to push their measures by any means as if this were a socialist system. \n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
