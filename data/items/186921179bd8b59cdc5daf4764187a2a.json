  "description": "Matthew Cecil brought many questions into his latest historical work, Hoover’s FBI and the Fourth Estate: The Campaign to Control the Press and the Bureau’s Image (University Press of Kansas, 2014).  Questions included, “Why were some members of the press so willing to serve as J. Edgar Hoover’s pawns, even when it was clear they were being used?” And, “How did Hoover’s interactions with the press resemble his leadership at the FBI?”  Cecil, director of Wichita State’s Elliott School of Communication, said he has long had research interests into Hoover’s FBI. This is a book that will draw interest far beyond the Academy. Those interested in politics, media, criminal justice and one of America’s most storied and divisive figures, Hoover, would do well to pick up this book.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
