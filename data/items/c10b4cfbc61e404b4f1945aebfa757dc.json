  "itunes:summary": "“So far from God, so close to the United States”. Porfirio Diaz’s infamous words describing Mexico’s relationship with the United States in many ways still ring true today. Whether through economic integration, the War on Drugs or even the steady stream of citizens and dollars moving across their shared border, the social, political and economic fate of Mexico remains as tied to its neighbors to the north today as it did in those early days following the Mexican revolution over a century ago. That relationship has seen its fair share of crests and waves, with the Presidency of Donald Trump heralding a potential low point in its discursive construction of its North American neighbor as a threat and the physical construction of a wall to keep so-called bad hombres out of the United States along the way. In many ways Mexico marked the first and arguably most consistent victim of Trumpian vision of ‘America First’, and though we are a year removed from the end of that vision one cannot help but wonder just what the Biden administration’s vision of a return to an American led liberal international order means for its Mexican neighbors and the North American continent more broadly. How has ‘America’s Back’ changed US-Mexican relations? What are Mexico’s developmental prospects under the revised CUSMA? And what role will Canada, that often overlooked ‘Third Amigo’, play in Mexico’s future political and economic prospects? To discuss these questions and more I am joined this week by Professor Laura Macdonald. Dr. Macdonald is a professor with the Department of Political Science at Carleton and a prolific specialist in the politics of Latin America and North America, as well as democracy and civil society.\n\n––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\nFollow us on social media:\ninstagram.com/cu_poli.sci\nfacebook.com/carletonu.polisci\ntwitter.com/CU_PoliSci\ncarleton.ca/polisci\nThanks so much for listening, and an extra thanks to Sappheiros for use of his music for our theme.\nLights by Sappheiros @sappheirosmusic\nCreative Commons — Attribution 3.0 Unported — CC BY 3.0\nFree Download / Stream: bit.ly/LightsSappheiros\nMusic promoted by Audio Library youtu.be/-lbbHQbZNKg\n––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n🎵 Track Info:\nTitle: Lights by Sappheiros\nGenre and Mood: Dance & Electronic + Inspirational\n———\n🎧 Available on:\nSpotify: open.spotify.com/album/4KnoJn...\niTunes: music.apple.com/us/album/ligh...\nDeezer: deezer.com/us/album/88114572\nYouTube: youtube.com/watch?v=xq3_uCEtiJI\nSoundCloud: @sappheirosmusi...\n———\n😊 Contact the Artist:\nzachremick1@gmail.com\nsappheiros.bandcamp.com\ndeezer.com/us/artist/13811001\n@sappheirosmusic\nmusic.apple.com/us/artist/sap...\nyoutube.com/channel/UCxLKyBhC...\nopen.spotify.com/artist/5ZVHX...\npaypal.com/paypalme2/sappheiros\ninstagram.com/sappheirosmusic\nfacebook.com/SappheirosMusic\ndiscordapp.com/invite/Pk87yN9\ntwitter.com/SappheirosMusic\npatreon.com/sappheiros",
