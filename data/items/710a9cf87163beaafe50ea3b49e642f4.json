  "description": "<p>“There is no such thing as a self-made man. You will reach your goals only with the help of others.” – George Shinn<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p>As a former lone wolf, the idea that I needed others to make an impact was a hard pill to swallow. But it’s true—it takes a team of people utilizing their unique strengths, solid communication, and a shared goal to make great things happen. This is the case whether we’re talking about creating a podcast, raising children, starting a business, or building a strong and successful marriage.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p>Our relationships are the most impactful thing on our health, happiness, and overall success—and they can take a lot of work. While it’s easy to place blame on others and put a magnifying glass on their shortcomings, that isn’t necessarily productive. But what can really make an impact on how your relationships function is to better understand yourself and your strengths. Once you have a better grasp on who you are, you can master your reactions and use your talents to be more productive and efficient in your roles.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p>In his new book, <em>You Ain’t the Boss of Me</em>, Dr. Eric “ET” Thomas shares how to empower yourself by uncovering your unique superpowers. Dr. Thomas is here with us today to share the critical takeaways and mindset shifts that can occur when you have a better understanding of who you are at your core. You’ll learn powerful lessons on how to manage your approaches and expectations, how uncovering your gifts and talents can help you thrive in all aspects of your life, and so many more profound insights.
