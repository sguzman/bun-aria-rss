  "description": "The 1992 film <em>A League Of Their Own</em> is a beloved sports movie classic – thanks to a memorable all-star cast led by Geena Davis and Tom Hanks, <em>and </em>repeat showings on cable TV. It's a fictionalized account of The Rockford Peaches, the real-life professional women's baseball team that was formed during World War II. With a new TV series adaptation on Amazon, now seems like the perfect time to revisit the original and reflect on its enduring legacy. ",
