  "title": "The Best Of Mark Levin - 7/9/22",
  "description": "This week on The Mark Levin Show, congress just passed a law preventing 18-21-year-olds from buying certain weapons and it didn't matter in the case of the Highland Park, IL shooting on July 4th because the real issue is cultural decay. The Highland shooter had run-ins with police including a suicide threat yet he purchased the rifle anyway to go on a killing spree. The media and gun critics stand up as if they have some sort of moral superiority and they blame law-abiding citizens and firearms for the actions of sick, hateful, mentally ill individuals. President Biden calls for gas station owners to charge less, while he's releasing millions of barrels of oil from the Strategic Petroleum Reserve and sending some of it overseas. There is a culture of loyalty within the Democrat Party that doesn't exist in the Republican Party. There hasn't been a single book written by a former Democrat staffer in the White House that has ever trashed their former Commander-in-Chief. However, the kiss-and-tell culture of disloyalty abounds in Republican circles. Not only are they disloyal but they leak information, embellish, and attack their former boss(es) for the sake of self-aggrandizement, power, fame, and a pay-day.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
