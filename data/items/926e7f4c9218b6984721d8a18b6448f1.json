And can we do it without upsetting homeowners and crashing the economy? \n\nBeth Stratford is a PhD student at Leeds University. Last February she published a blog post at OpenDemocracy that was so interesting we knew we had to get her on the podcast to talk about it. She argues it just might be possible to lower house prices without crashing the economy. \n\nJoe Beswick, head of housing and land here at the New Economics Foundation, joined Beth and Ayeisha Thomas-Smith, to chat through the idea.\n\nWe hope you enjoy! And we’ll be back next week with a brand new episode.\n\nEnjoying the show?
