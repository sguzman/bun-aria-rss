  "description": "<p>Have you ever wondered what your life would be like if you had chosen another path? Would you have been more successful in your craft? A better writer, artist, musician? Would you have made a bigger impact in the world? My guest today, Jesse Browner, has by all rights been <em>extremely</em> successful. He has a great marriage and family, living in the middle of Manhattan. He is a successful author whose books have been published by some of the biggest houses in New York City and he has a lucrative full-time job.</p><p>However, as Jesse approached his 50s, he started wondering, \"What if?\"</p><p>Jesse spent his 20s in what was known as the heartbeat of Bohemia in New York City (if you have ever seen the movie or the musical <em>Rent</em>, then you know exactly the place I am describing). As he looked back at this time, he realized that although no one he knew was extremely successful or rich, they were all living and breathing their craft.</p><p>From this reflection came the question, \"Is there an untapped wealth of talent just buried within me?\"</p><p>Jesse's exploration of this question over many years led to his latest book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/How-Did-Get-Here-Making/dp/0062275704/ref=sr_1_1?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1466294506&sr=1-1&keywords=how+did+i+get+here+by+jesse+browner\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How Did I Get Here?</em></a><em>.</em> Today, Jesse guides us through his incredible journey of discovery and letting go.
