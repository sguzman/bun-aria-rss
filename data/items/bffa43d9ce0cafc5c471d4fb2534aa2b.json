In some people who experience autoimmune conditions such as Sjogren’s, rheumatoid arthritis, or lupus, Raynaud’s Syndrome may be present. Raynaud’s is an uncomfortable vascular condition affecting the small arteries, prompting them to spasm, and can have a big impact on quality of life. Symptoms can include numbness and pain in fingers, toes, ears, or nose when exposed to cold weather or stress. Raynaud’s can also appear on its own in a milder form than if accompanied by another autoimmune condition.&nbsp;</p><br><p>In this episode, Dr. Hyman discusses Raynaud's Syndrome with Dr. Cindy Geyer. They talk about who is at greatest risk of developing this condition and how it can lead to other more serious conditions such as high blood pressure, heart conditions, and stroke. They also explore the Functional Medicine approach to treating Raynaud’s, including healing the gut and incorporating stress management techniques.</p><br><p>Dr. Cindy Geyer received her Bachelor of Science and her Doctor of Medicine degrees, with honors, from the Ohio State University. She completed residency in internal medicine at Strong Memorial Hospital in Rochester, N.Y. and is triple board certified in internal medicine, integrative medicine, and lifestyle medicine. She joined The Ultrawellness Center in 2021 after practicing and serving as the medical director at Canyon Ranch for 23 years. She has served on the Board of Directors for the American College of Lifestyle Medicine and is a recently elected fellow of ACLM. Dr. Geyer has been a core faculty member at The Center for Mind-Body Medicine (CMBM) for 20 years, teaching physicians and other healthcare professionals how to use food and lifestyle to address health concerns in their own lives and those of their patients. A clinician, educator, and avid hiker, she is passionate about collaborative approaches to health and wellness: from the integrative team model in working with individual patients, to community partnerships that together can affect healthy changes in the places people live and work.</p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by Rupa Health and Athletic Greens.</p><br><p>Rupa Health is a place for Functional Medicine practitioners to access more than 2,000 specialty lab tests from over 20 labs like DUTCH, Vibrant America, Genova, Great Plains, and more.
