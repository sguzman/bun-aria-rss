  "description": "David Barton has been described as “America’s historian.” He is a best-selling author and the founder of WallBuilders, and he sits on the board of Mercury One, Glenn’s humanitarian and educational charity. And if combined with Glenn's, his private collection of founding-era documents would be rivaled only by the Library of Congress. Barton and Glenn take a look at a few artifacts on both the good and bad sides of history. Most importantly, they emphasize knowing WHY you believe what you do. History has been dulled and politicized in our schools and government – and our Bill of Rights is suffering from it. But organizations like WallBuilders and Mercury One are dedicated to preserving and teaching the truth.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
