  "description": "<p>Maybe there are artists who are always inspired, always energised and always making fantastic work... but if there are, we don't know them. This week we're talking about those times when inspiration seems to desert us. These are the times when we either can't face making art, or can't make anything we like. We discuss the frustration that comes with feeling lost, and we break down some of the reasons we might feel that way. This is so important because, if we can understand what drags us down, perhaps we can lift ourselves out of it. As always, we both believe this comes down to individual preferences and work patterns. Some people work best when they turn up every day regardless of how they feel; others need lots of time away from the studio to recharge their batteries. We believe all of us need to learn to accept ourselves just the way we are, and honour our own creative processes, no matter what they are.</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>Rock til we Drop <a href=\"\">https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m001516f</a></p>\n<p>Medicine exhibition - The Science Museum: <a href=\"\">https://www.sciencemuseum.org.uk/see-and-do/medicine-wellcome-galleries</a><br>\n<br>\nFind our websites and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/\">www.alicesheridan.com&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicesheridanstudio/\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art/\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p>Credits: \"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n",
