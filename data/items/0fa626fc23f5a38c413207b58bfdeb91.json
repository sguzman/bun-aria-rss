  "description": "After watching the Twin Towers collapse on 9/11, Noah Galloway immediately enlisted in the military at just 21 years old. Three months into his second deployment, an IED exploded, ripping apart the Humvee he was driving and nearly ending his life. He awoke five days later to find both his left arm and left leg amputated. After he finally returned home, he was overcome by a deep depression. When his marriage dissolved and he spent 10 days in county jail for a DUI, he knew he had to turn his life around. Determined to be a good role model for his children, he slowly clawed his way out of depression and into the gym to begin his mental and physical rebirth. His grit and determination began to attract media attention, landing him on the cover of Men’s Health Magazine and multiple TV appearances on Ellen, The Today Show, and the military-inspired competition series American Grit. He also earned third place on Dancing With the Stars.
