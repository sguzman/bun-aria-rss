  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, a belief that Republicans will slaughter the Democrats in the 2022 midterm elections is no reason to sit on one's laurels. Americans must organize now that a movement has been built. After 10 weeks on the New York Times bestsellers list and one million copies of Mark Levin's American Marxism book now sold, there are one million people that understand how American Marxists work. They are better prepared to get active and counter President Biden's policies and the American Marxists implementing them. Then, the Biden Administration is sabotaging America. Democrats feed on a divided, and economically weak America because that's when the American Marxists step in to offer all sorts of free government support. This is the Cloward and Piven strategy of overwhelming the system, crashing it, blaming it, and transforming it. Later, a group of 15,000 Haitians has illegally crossed the border into Del Rio, Texas. The media goes after the border patrol on horseback instead of after Biden's policies. Anyone challenging this gets labeled a xenophobic racist. This is how the radicals change the voter rolls, by changing the citizenry. Meanwhile, when Cubans that escaped communism were rejected while all other immigrants escaping their countries are welcomed. Afterward, Democrats are attacking the funding of Israel’s Iron Dome yet they never complained about the massive spending bills they've advanced. Finally, House Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy calls in with an update on why Democrats defunded the Iron Dome that protects Israel because the pro-BDS anti-Israel leftwing is running the Party.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
