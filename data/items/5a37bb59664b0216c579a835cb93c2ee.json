This week's episode focuses on romantic relationships. I discuss the top 7 reasons why you're not getting what you need and want in relationships:</p> <p>1. You're afraid to ask for it.</p> <p>2. You're being passive in the process.</p> <p>3. You're too busy listening to others or comparing yourself to others.</p> <p>4. You've convinced yourself you don't need or want love.</p> <p>5. You're not clear about what you need and want.</p> <p>6. You're not being flexible.</p> <p>7. You haven't healed from past hurts.</p> <p>For more information and resources, visit the website at <a href=\"http://www.therapyforblackgirls.com\">therapyforblackgirls.com</a></p> <p>To join the conversation on social media, use the hashtag <strong>#TBGinSession</strong>.
