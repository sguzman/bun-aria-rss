  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, we still have American citizens behind enemy lines in Afghanistan and the elites in the Democrat Party don’t care. Why is there no committee on Americans left behind enemy lines in Afghanistan? Planes on the runway at the Kabul airport are being prevented from leaving, yet the White House refuses to call them hostages. The media ignores the presence of Iran, Russia, and China in the region. Meanwhile, the Biden administration still can't produce the nearly 5,000 children that they can't account for. And every time there's a natural disaster it's We The People that become the problem for causing climate change, or for White supremacy, or anything else. Then, the New York Times's Paul Krugman has taken aim at Levin's book \"American Marxism\" taking cheap shots, instead of accepting the public challenge to debate the substance of the book's premise on a live broadcast of this program. Later, Nicholas Wade, the former science editor of the New York Times, broke the COVID origin story earlier this year. Now, the New York Post is reporting that Anthony Fauci has been caught in a lie regarding his alleged ignorance on animal testing and gain of function experiments at the Wuhan Institute of Virology in China. Afterward, Marx was a pagan and as much as they'd like it, there's never been a right to abortion in the U.S Constitution.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
