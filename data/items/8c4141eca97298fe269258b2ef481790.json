Later, the media mocked President Trump and Sen. Tom Cotton for suggesting the coronavirus leaked from the Wuhan Institute of Virology. Shouldn't the scientists know about which grants they have issued and to whom? Hower eco-Health Alliance in New York did receive a grant and used it for gain of function research on the coronavirus. Fauci's response was dishonest. Afterward, Sen Mike Lee calls in to discuss why the innovation and competition act is the wrong way to beat China. Instead of chilling innovation and competition, we ought to decentralize power and champion trust in the private sector. Lee added that Biden's nominee to head the ATF is one of the worst he's ever seen, especially on the second amendment. Finally, Curtis Sliwa, candidate for Mayor of New York City, joins the show to discuss how he will stop the crime in NYC.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
