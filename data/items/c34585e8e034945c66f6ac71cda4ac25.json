  "description": "This week we have a very serious guest to talk about very serious things; a true gentleman who will walk you to your car and clean your windshield if you ask to take a selfie with him. You guessed it: Sir Conan O’Brien. He discusses the collapse of the shelf of his hair and how he’s dealt with the trauma since, his resting heart-rate of a hummingbird, and historical moments with Tom Selleck’s mustache. Because it’s a podcast, and that’s what happens.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
