    "media:description": "This video uses CI (comprehensible input) to teach the informal future structure (IR + a + infinitive). With this future tense, you can talk about what you are \"going to do\" for your New Year's Resolution. You can also talk about the near future, such as what your goal is going to be just for today or for this week. \n\nThrough storytelling, as well as \"storyasking,\" you will have moments to practice speaking Spanish and responding to questions in the target language as we explore some common New Year's resolutions to bring some positive change to our new day, week or year. \n\nTPRS (Teaching Proficiency through Reading and Storytelling) has been proven to be an effective and engaging way to learn a new language. If you enjoy this approach to language acquisition, let me know by subscribing to my channel for more TPRS and CI videos to come!\n\n//Links to budget-friendly products to record this video:\nWireless microphone for recording on cell phone:\nhttps://amzn.to/39OKBOK\n\nTripod stand for cell phone with ring light:\nhttps://amzn.to/3qvVpad\nAs an Amazon Associate I earn from qualifying purchases.",
