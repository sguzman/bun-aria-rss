  "description": "Our guest today, Barbara de Vries, has a most impressive and varied background as a creative. Her prolific career includes launching CK at Calvin Klein, working on projects for Ralph Lauren and Pantone, creating her own fashion line, and co-founding her own publishing and media company. She also worked as a model and an environmental activist. Today we talk to Barbara about her new book, Coming Home: Modern Rustic, Creative Living in Dutch Interiors.\nWhat You’ll Hear on This Episode:\n\n\nBarbara’s adventurous career path.\n\nHow Barbara’s Dutch lineage has inspired her philosophy and style.\n\nThe difference between using the old and the new in the US vs. Europe.\n\nHow the work from home movement is evolving our spaces.\n\nCultural differences make a big difference in kitchen size and design.\n\nWhy we all can benefit from using more daily conservation efforts.\n\nA Decorating Dilemma about the power of well-adjusted drapes.\n\nWhat can we learn about Dutch Interior Design to take into our own homes?\n\nBarbara was a model and an environmental activist?\n\n\nDecorating Dilemma \nI must say I have never seen a house with all the ceilings painted before and I understand that not being your style. Ideally, you would paint all over everything. If your budget doesn't allow it, though, then I would advise painting the ceilings white. Your house would immediately come much lighter and bright. Going room by room, I would buy 2 paintings and a mirror for the dining to the wall to the left of your window. I wouldn't worry about a rug because the light reflects beautifully on the natural wood floor. Drapes could also make it look cozier in there. I would get large vases and keep fresh flowers in there. I would also paint the wall below the staircase and the hallway ceiling white. I would live with the terracotta in your living room and maybe add some pieces that reflect that color. If there isn't a rug in there, I would get a rug that picks up on those colors. And if you don't want to paint, maybe try tile underneath the cabinets.\nIf all the suggestions are too much work, I would definitely start with the white ceilings, white dining room, and white panel on the stairs. It's a great, sunny space! We would love to see the after photos!\n\n\nMentioned in This Episode:\nBarbara de Vries\nGoing Dutch Interiors on Instagram\nTED Talk - Plastic is Forever\nComing Home: Modern Rustic, Creative Living in Dutch Interiors",
