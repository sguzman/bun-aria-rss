  "description": "A Tuesday pod on a Thursday! ESPN producer (and former third mic on Sports?) Andrea Masenda joins Katie to talk about stuff that happened this week like they used to at the office in The Before Times. Topics include: how to make new friends as an Old; an incredibly inconsequential catfish situation we're genuinely sorry for caring about (21:50); the death of the Super League (43:44); that Raiders tweet and why it stinks even if they \"meant well\" (48:18). And lastly: a list of every TV show Andrea has watched over the last year and why you should or shouldn't watch it (1:06:08) and a voicemail about long distance relationships (1:45:42). Tomorrow is Friday, folks. You're almost there.",
