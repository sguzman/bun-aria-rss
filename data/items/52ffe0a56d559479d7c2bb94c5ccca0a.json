  "description": "<p>When you think of wartime prison escapes, what comes to mind? Probably the breakouts attempted by prisoners of war during World War II and the movie <em>The Great Escape</em>. But the escapees of WWII learned many of the tricks of the trade from their pioneering predecessors, who honed their courageous craft during the first World War.</p><p>My guest today has written a book about their audacious exploits. His name is Neal Bascomb, and his book is: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B07895QNLK/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B07895QNLK&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Escape Artists: A Band of Daredevil Pilots and the Greatest Prison Break of the Great War</em></a>. Today on the show, Neal describes what conditions were like for British POWs during WWI, and why prisoners wanted to escape the German camps, even when they were relatively comfortable. We also discuss Germany's most infamous POW camp, which was essentially a land-locked Alcatraz designed to hold the most escape-prone prisoners. While it was believed to be impossible to escape, Neal describes how the prisoners hatched an elaborate breakout plan anyway, and made a 175-yard tunnel towards freedom. We end our discussion with what Neal took away from the heroic exploits of these men.</p><p>You're going to really enjoy this look at a fascinating slice of history.</p><p>Get the show notes at <a href=\"http://aom.is/escapeartist\" target=\"_blank\">aom.is/escapeartist</a>.</p>\n",
