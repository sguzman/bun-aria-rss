  "description": "On Tuesday’s Mark Levin show, President Biden is the dumbest, nastiest, President ever, he's a lair who doesn’t care about America. MLB has pulled their All-Star game from a city that is 51% Black to a city that is 76.1% White. The Democrat party has been a racist party since its inception and uses people because of their race. Democrats abandoned individual responsibility a long time ago. Yet, they lie and say that this isn't about taking over and weakening our voting system for their political gain, but that it is all about \"new Jim Crow laws\" - their actions speak louder than their words. Biden's history as a supporter of segregationists and his affinity for left-wing pablum is antithetical to the civil rights movement. Biden is obsessed with picking at the scab of race because Biden has always been a racist. In 1977 Biden worried that de-segregation would cause his children to grow up in what he called a \"racial jungle.\" Later, Iran is celebrating as they move ahead with their nuclear program and Biden's team only helps them to achieve it. Iran and the US are now in agreement on their path to a nuclear program. Afterward, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis joins the show to explain how the media disreputably smeared him when they deceptively edited his comments on Florida's vaccine distribution with a very reputable retail pharmacy chain. DeSantis added that Anthony Fauci has never contacted him to learn how his administration was so successful in keeping the economy open and following the science to keep infection rates down. DeSantis says President Donald Trump is the one that deserves the credit for the vaccine. \n\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
