  "description": "<p>John Maxwell says the first person you must learn how to lead is yourself. This week, we’re starting a new series called “How to Start Successfully.” Spring is a time of year when we’re thinking of new beginnings and starting fresh. How you start can set you up for success or set the stage for failure on the rest of your journey.</p> <p>That’s why, in this episode, we’re not just talking about how to start––we’re talking about how to start off right. John will dive into the importance of starting the journey with yourself and starting early.</p> <p>Your host, Mark Cole, is joined by Jason Brooks to talk about the roles that setting priorities and developing your life philosophy play in starting a new endeavor successfully.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this series is the How to Start Successfully Worksheet, which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching. You can download the worksheet by visiting MaxwellPodcast.com/start and clicking “Download the Bonus Resource.”</p> <p>References:</p> <p><em><a href=\"http://leadershiftbook.com/\">Leadershift by John C.
