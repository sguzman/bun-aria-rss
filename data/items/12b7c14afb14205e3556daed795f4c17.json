  "description": "<p><p>Kirk Minihane has abandoned Bob Hearts Abishola. The once-promising CBS sitcom has lost its charm after only one week. As such, Minifans are released from their sworn obligation to watch the show loyally. Minihane spends the morning jiggling church doors. WEEI, the Entercom station that once employed our own Podcast Jesus, is consumed with paranoia, infighting and conspiracy theories thanks to Blind Mike and the Minifans. Hillary Clinton tells us to leave Joe Biden alone. Shane Gillis might come on the show? Someone in Vietnam is trying to sell bootleg Minifan t-shirts. Minihane gets a lesson in gender theory from his new favorite podcast, Gender Reveal. </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
