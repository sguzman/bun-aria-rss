  "description": "Naomi Stein of Design Manifest joins the show this week to share how working with her contractor father gave her an eye for design and a purpose to help others make their lives more functional. We talk about making a room light, bright and comfortable, the big mistakes we tend to overlook in kitchen design, and hacks for small spaces. She also talks about finding that middle balance between your dream and your budget, and things people should look out for when working with an interior designer. \nWhat You’ll Hear on This Episode:\nNaomi worked with her father for 12 years which helped her knowledge of working in high-end homes, and honed her skills for taking her clients to the next level. Common mistakes we tend to make including layout, form, and functionWhat Naomi doesn’t want to see in a kitchen, and what appliances she thinks is okayIdeas for storing trash bins in a sleek yet recognizable space, and ideas for housing composting and recycling containers inside a kitchen. Naomi’s best hacks using Ikea cubbies, and what she learned from renovating her own small space, or “twin” as they call it in Philadelphia. A large part of Naomi’s success is the fact that she is very aware with both the artistic vision of a project, along with the realistic overview about budget and what it will take to get it practically aligned. What works when mixing finishes in a kitchenWhere it’s easiest to take risks in the kitchen, and personal examples Naomi has worked with either in her professional life or in her own personal renovations. What to do with outlets! Do we color them, do we have USB outlets, lamps with USB options, etc!",
