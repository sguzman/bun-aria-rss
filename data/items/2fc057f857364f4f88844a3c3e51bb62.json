  "description": "<p>This is it. The Besties have been on hiatus — which intimates a brief pause in an otherwise regular schedule, so let's call it a \"temporary cancellation\" — for a few months now, but we've gathered the crew back together for one last hurrah. We're going to talk about video games for a very, very long time, y'all. In this four-hour series finale, we're pitting 2014's best games against one another in unyielding combat to the death. (This isn't Polygon's official Game of the Year lineup, though — those will be announced soon!)\nFor those that have stuck with us from the beginning, through the exploratory episodes, the Chris Grant-a-Tron period, the video specials and countless horrible, imaginary special guests — thank you. Sorry it got so weird there, in the middle. Now: Let's close this out right.\n<p>The Games</p>\n<p>Dragon Age: Inquisition<br />\nMiddle-earth: Shadow of Mordor<br />\nMario Kart 8<br />\nSuper Smash Bros. for Wii U<br />\nHearthstone: Heroes of Warcraft<br />\nTransistor<br />\nP.T.<br />\nFar Cry 4<br />\nDark Souls 2<br />\nBayonetta 2<br />\nWolfenstein: The New Order<br />\nDestiny<br />\nCall of Duty: Advanced Warfare<br />\nTitanfall<br />\nSunset Overdrive<br />\nShovel Knight</p>\n<p>Theme song by Ian Dorsch<br />\nGet the show:</p>\n<p>Download MP3\"</p></p>\n",
