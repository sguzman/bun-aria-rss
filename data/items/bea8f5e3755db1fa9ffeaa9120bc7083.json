  "description": "<p>It’s September 4, 1986. And Deirdre has just met a kindred spirit in singer <strong>Syd Straw.</strong> Like Deirdre, Syd traveled in good company. You could pick out her voice on records by <strong>Los Lobos, Rickie Lee Jones, Was (Not Was), </strong>and more. As an early member of the indie supergroup <strong>The Golden Palominos</strong>, she was a feature on Deirdre’s playlists long before she became a regular guest.</p>\n<p>Most artists that appeared on “SNAP!” will tell you how comfortable Deirdre made them feel. That absolutely resulted in fantastic on-air performances. But Syd and Deirdre took that to a whole new level. If Deirdre had an official partner-in-crime, it was Syd Straw, who appeared on the show five times. She would sing with a band, or over backing tapes that she brought with her, or she would just guest DJ. And no topic was off limits. They had their own wild chemistry: funny, fearless, and more than a little bent.</p>\n<p>In 1989, Syd struck out on a solo career which eventually took her to New York City. But even now, Syd is rich with memories of the pioneering DJ and friend whom she called “The Godmother.”</p>",
