  "description": "<p>In a spark of creativity, cartoonist Matt Furie created an innocent, loving frog he named Pepe. What came next is so insane, it literally bent reality.</p><p>Filmmakers&nbsp;<strong>Arthur Jones & Giorgio Angelini</strong>&nbsp;wanted to understand how this sweet and relatively obscure indie comic book character morphed into an infamous symbol of hate—and a meme that changed the world. The result is&nbsp;<strong><em>Feels Good Man</em></strong><em>—</em>a filmmaking triumph and one of the best documentaries I’ve seen in years.</p><p>Premiering at last year’s Sundance, where it picked up the U.S. Documentary Special Jury Award for Emerging Filmmaker, it’s the surreal story of&nbsp;Pepe The Frog. How it migrated across the internet, evolving into an unwitting avatar of chaos and a lever for radicalization. It’s about its creator Matt Furie’s efforts to reclaim his creation. And Pepe’s slow transmogrification back into a hieroglyph of positivity.</p><p>But beneath the surface,&nbsp;<em>Feels Good Man&nbsp;</em>is about artistic agency. It’s about the journey from passivity to participation. A sociological excavation of how culture spreads from mind to mind, it’s also an archeological dig into the indelible power of an idea. How a meme adopted by a regressive internet subculture spilled into the real world, shifted the political landscape, and ultimately tipped a presidential election.</p><p>The film is an absolute must-see.
