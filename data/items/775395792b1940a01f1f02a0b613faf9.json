  "description": "<p>LAS CULTCH HAS A NEW IMAGE. And to mark that epic new era..well, Jesus, we're sorry you have to see this one... because Josh and Aaron have returned. Tweedle Dee and Tweedle F*g. Fifth time! If we had jackets for that time of thing, they'd get them. But we don't. Anyways, this one is sheer chaos from the jump. They are the writers and stars of a dirty snuff film with music that is a freak project that will be banned in many countries. It's called F*cking Identical Twins and it isn't out yet! Someday later! Good luck to all people who listen to this and please understand we recorded it before Russia invaded Ukraine, which we do have to say and stress. I'm obsession, I kiss. Listen to this podcast. IT'S.... FREEEEEEEE!</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
