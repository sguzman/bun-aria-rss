  "description": "<p>Many people consider ayahuasca “the queen” of psychedelic plant medicines – and few people know more about ayahuasca than the Brazilian anthropologist, Bia Labate. She has authored, co-authored or co-edited over twenty books about ayahuasca as well as other plant medicines, shamanism, ritual, religion and drug policy. The U.S.-based educational and advocacy organization she founded and directs, The Chacruna Institute of Psychedelic Plant Medicines, is an extraordinary resource on all these issues. Whether you’re already experienced with ayahuasca or are thinking of trying it for the first time, this conversation will prove insightful.<br><br>Bia and I discussed the varied uses of ayahuasca by indigenous peoples in the Amazon region, syncretic religions and the millions of people who have consumed it around the world in recent decades. We talked about its potential medical uses, the challenges and opportunities presented by “ayahuasca tourism,” and some of the controversies generated by groups that don’t live up to the enlightened ideals typically associated with respectful use of plant medicines. And Bia offered her advice about making the most of one’s ayahuasca experience while staying safe.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
