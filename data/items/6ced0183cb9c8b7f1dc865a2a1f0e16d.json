  "description": "Frank is traveling, leaving me (Daniel Creech) behind the mic today to discuss the headlines… I break down what recent actions by Russia’s central bank say about commodity prices… why the Russian ruble recovered all its losses following the invasion of Ukraine… how future sanctions will impact commodities like oil, gas, and gold… and how individual investors can profit as the global financial system undergoes massive changes.  On a more lighthearted note, I explain what Elon Musk’s latest move says about activist investors… and if Twitter (TWTR) could become the next meme stock.  In this episode:  Where’s Frank? [0:15] Why you should pay attention to the ruble [3:35] Will currencies become linked to commodities? [6:00] Stocks that will profit from sanctions against Russia [13:10] The new activist investor [14:00] Is Elon Musk the new BlackRock? [20:50]  Enjoyed this episode?
