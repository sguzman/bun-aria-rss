  "description": "<p>It’s difficult to concisely sum up interior designer <strong>Kathryn M. Ireland</strong>’s charmed career —she’s been everything from an art director for music videos to a shop-owner, interior decorator, fabric designer and TV Star. Most recently she’s become an entrepreneur, founding e-design and e-commerce startup The Perfect Room, which she hopes will bring high design to a broader audience (her partner, CEO Michael O’Neal, joins the discussion for the second half of this episode). On this episode, Ireland spoke with host Dennis Scully about the role that serendipity has played in her career, how she turned the recession into an opportunity, and why being an interior designer is a lifestyle as much as it is a profession. <i>This episode is sponsored by BuildLane and Dedon</i>.</p>\n",
