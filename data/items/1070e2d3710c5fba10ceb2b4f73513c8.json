  "description": "Permeable blood brain barrier and gut barrier connected to inflammation and autoimmunity diseases is enough to make anyone’s head spin.<br /><br />Dealing with these health conditions can be frightening and endless. Your body’s reaction to proteins and your immune response can be highly frustrating when you’re being instructed to follow “protocols” and standards of treatment.<br /><br />If you or someone you love has felt betrayed living a standard healthy lifestyle only to fall prey to gut issues, autoimmune disease and declining cognition, you’re not alone.<br /><br />Dr. Datis Kharrazian is a world-renowned functional medicine health care provider. He specializes in managing chronic diseases, autoimmunity and neurological problems. He treats his patients with non-pharmaceuticals, and is in extremely high demand from patients and other healthcare professionals wanting to learn his clinical models.<br /><br />In this episode, Dr. Kharrazian is addressing the flaw with medical treatments that over standardize what people are experiencing and the causes. He’s explaining why giving blanket treatments and protocols can cause patients far worse health conditions than where they started.<br /><br />Check out Dr. Kharrazian’s book, Why Isn’t My Brain Working: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3wvDplt\" rel=\"noopener\">https://amzn.to/3wvDplt</a> <br /><br />SHOW NOTES:<br /><br />0:00 | Introduction to Datis Kharrazian<br />0:37 | Do You Have Leaky Brain?<br />4:15 | The Problem with Gluten<br />16:48 | How Autoimmune Disease Happens<br />25:37 | Avoid These Foods<br />32:22 | Prevent Brain Disease<br />39:57 | Do This To Stay Healthy<br />51:10 | Push Neurological Limits<br /><br /><br />QUOTES:<br /><br />“The same inflammatory oxidative stress mechanisms that break down the gut barrier can also break down the blood brain barrier.” [2:20]<br /><br />“We’re all at risk for developing autoimmune disease, and the rates of autoimmune disease now exceed cancer and cardiovascular disease combined.”  [20:33]<br /><br />“The more diverse your gut bacteria microbiome is, the more immune regulation you have, the greater tolerance you have, and things like exercise improves gut microbiome diversity.”  [32:00]<br /><br />“I do not have a protocol.
