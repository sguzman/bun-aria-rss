    "media:description": "So....this one took me a week of nonstop editing and wrecked nerves so I really hope you'll enjoy it. The algorithm decided to BLOW UP my last video which is humbling but also quite terrifying. I really am at loss for words.\n\nI got a lot of comments regarding it's length therefore I decided to post this one. Even though this vid is not much longer than the previous one it's still MORE content soo...I hope y'all won't murder me in the comments.",
