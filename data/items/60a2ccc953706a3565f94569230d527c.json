  "description": "<p>Here’s a random yet important fact: Copper is one of the very best conductors of electricity of all metals. And that matters, because as we move toward a world in which more and more things in our lives plug in or charge up–not just your phone, but electric vehicles, solar panels and wind turbines that will power the future–copper is in increasingly high demand. Worldwide, about 21 million metric tons of it are hauled up from the ground each year. And demand will soon double.<br><br>Some of the richest reserves of copper are found in Southern Africa. But getting it from deep underground and trucking it thousands of miles to buyers can be a harrowing journey.</p>\n<p>Without more production or new mines, the world could be looking at shortages, and soaring prices for copper and the products that use it. Joining this episode are Santiago-based commodities reporter <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/AOg5GZvamFc/james-attwood\">James Attwood</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.bloomberg.com/authors/AUNP6pcrJRQ/yvonne-yue-li\">Yvonne Yue Li</a>, a metals and mining reporter in New York.
