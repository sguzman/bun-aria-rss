  "description": "<p>Do you allow yourself to want what you really want?</p> <p>Most of us are stuck between our deepest desires and what society believes are the right things for us.</p> <p>We all have desires. We all have a calling from our mind, body, and soul that's always nudging us in the right direction if we choose to listen to them.</p> <p>The challenge today is that many of us have become hard of hearing when it comes to the communication from within.</p> <p>It's true. If you are able to really listen to your body it will tell you exactly what he or she needs (thank today's guest we're no longer going to refer to your body as an \"it\").</p> <p>You already have everything you need to get you where you want to go. It's just about deciphering the messages in your cravings so that you can be free to live a life that's truly worthy of you. That's what today's episode is all about.</p> <p>Today we are fortunate to have on bestselling author Alex Jamieson so help us crack the code on cravings, and help us to understand our innermost desires.
