There’s a good chance we’ll need <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg25033342-900-covid-19-booster-shots-will-we-need-them-and-how-would-they-work/'>vaccine booster shots</a> to keep on top of the disease. With Israel already planning to roll these out, and many other countries considering the same, the team explains what the booster shots will look like. They then explore the mind-melting discovery that <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/2277050-measuring-time-accurately-increases-the-entropy-in-the-universe/'>simply by measuring time</a>, humans are adding to the amount of entropy or disorder in the universe. They catch up with the neuroscientist <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg25033340-900-david-eagleman-interview-how-our-brains-could-create-whole-new-senses/'>David Eagleman who explains the concept of brain plasticity</a>. They mark a very special year for the loudest insect in the world - cicadas - and they discuss how degrowth - a deliberate step down in economic activity - might be the safest way to keep global warming at 1.5 degrees. On the pod are Rowan Hooper, Tiffany O'Callaghan, Graham Lawton and Clare Wilson.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
