    "media:description": "Democrats Run UNHINGED Ad Of Woman ARRESTED For Having Abortion, Voters Switch To GOP Over Inflation. Democrats are banking huge on abortion and January 6th despite voters only caring about inflation and gas prices.\n\nEric Swalwell ran a ridiculous and poorly produced ad showing a woman getting arrested at dinner with her family. The message is vote Democrat or else. Except even Chuck Grassley and most republicans reject arresting women for abortion and they even opposed a national abortion ban.\n\nBiden is tanking the economy and desperately trying to control gas prices even sacrificing our strategic petroleum reserves for political gain\n\n#democrats \n#republicans \n#biden\n\nBecome A Member And Protect Our Work at http://www.timcast.com\n\nMy Second Channel - https://www.youtube.com/timcastnews\nPodcast Channel - https://www.youtube.com/TimcastIRL\n\nMerch - http://teespring.com/timcast\n\nMake sure to subscribe for more travel, news, opinion, and documentary with Tim Pool everyday.",
