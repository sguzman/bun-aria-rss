  "description": "An interview with Allegra Hyde, author of Eleutheria (Vintage, 2020), a debut novel about an idealist who comes face to face with the allure and pitfalls of utopian eco-communities. Allegra and I discuss the need for hopeful narratives of a possible future in an age of climate disaster, and how and why art is poised to craft those narratives. We talk about the “stench of perfectionism” that invades some intentional communities, the pleasures of dumpster-diving with Freegans, the beautiful art of terrarium making, trying to live the solution when the world isn’t listening, and so much more.\nBooks Recommended in this episode:\n\nAlexandra Kleeman, Something New Under the Sun\n\n\nLydia Millet, A Children’s Bible\n\n\nMatt Bell, Appleseed\n\n\nAmitav Gosh, The Great Derangement\n\n\nAndreas Malm, How to Blow Up a Pipeline\n\n\n﻿\nChris Holmes is Chair of Literatures in English and Associate Professor at Ithaca College. He writes criticism on contemporary global literatures. His book, Kazuo Ishiguro as World Literature, is under contract with Bloomsbury Publishing.
