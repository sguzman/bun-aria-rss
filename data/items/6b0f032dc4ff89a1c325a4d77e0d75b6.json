    "media:description": "DR. ROLLERGATOR was making waves on twitter until he crossed a line. (A very silly line, but still.) His twitter persona was quirky and brash, but when I looked into his essays, I found a deep thinker who could translate complexity into coherency, on a number of issues. In this discussion, we talk about media narratives and power politics and how he sees conspiracies everywhere, while still not being a conspiracy theorist. \n\nFind him on substack at\n\nhttps://drrollergator.substack.com\n\nSupport this channel: https://www.paypal.me/benjaminboyce\n\nFind all interviews on spotify: https://spoti.fi/3px5WnK\n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/benjaminboyce\n\nJoin me on alternative video sites:\n\nhttps://odysee.com/@BenjaminABoyce\nhttps://www.bitchute.com/channel/benjaminboyce/\nhttps://rumble.com/user/BenjaminABoyce\nAnd on Twitter @BenjaminABoyce",
