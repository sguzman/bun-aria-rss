  "description": "Why is falling in love so exciting and painful at the same time? And what explains our longing for people who are bad for us or no longer love us back? In her book On Romantic Love: Simple Truths about a Complex Emotion (Oxford University Press, 2015), philosopher and cognitive scientist Berit Brogaard tackles these and other difficult questions through the lenses of biochemistry, philosophy, and psychology. She argues that love is an emotion to which humans can become addicted but which they also possess the power to overcome. In our interview, we discuss cutting-edge ways of conceptualizing romantic love as well as practical, real-life strategies for navigating its many ups and downs.\n\nBerit Brogaard is Professor of Philosophy and Director of the Brogaard Lab for Multisensory Research at University of Miami, as well as Professor of Philosophy at University of Oslo. She answers letters from love-stricken readers on her Psychology Today webpage The Mysteries of Love.

He treats individuals and couples, with specialties in LGBTQ issues, eating and body image problems, and relationship problems. Follow him on Twitter and Instagram.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
