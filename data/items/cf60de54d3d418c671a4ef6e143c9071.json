  "description": "<p>Iron ilmenene is a new two-dimensional material that has recently been\nexfoliated from the naturally-occurring iron titanate found in ilmenite ore, a\nmaterial that is abundant on earth surface. In this work, we theoretically\ninvestigate the structural, electronic and magnetic properties of 2D\ntransition-metal-based ilmenene-like titanates. The study of magnetic order\nreveals that these ilmenenes usually present intrinsic antiferromagnetic\ncoupling between the 3d magnetic metals decorating both sides of the Ti-O\nlayer. Furthermore, the ilmenenes based on late 3d brass metals, such as\nCuTiO$_3$ and ZnTiO$_3$, become ferromagnetic and spin compensated,\nrespectively. Our calculations including spin-orbit coupling reveal that the\nmagnetic ilmenenes have large magnetocrystalline anisotropy energies when the\n3d shell departs from being either filled or half-filled, with their spin\norientation being out-of-plane for elements below half-filling of 3d states and\nin-plane above. These interesting magnetic properties of ilmenenes make them\nuseful for future spintronic applications because they could be synthesized as\nalready realized in the iron case.\n</p>",
