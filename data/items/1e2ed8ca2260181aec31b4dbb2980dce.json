  "description": "<p>Today we tick another sport off our list that we've never featured interview from before with our first ever curler, the one and only Jill Officer. Jill was on the undefeated gold medal winning team from Sochi, and she talks us through all the thoughts and emotions of the historic run in Sochi on the way to the gold medal. She takes us back to how she got into the sport through her family, and how she met her long time team mate Jennifer Jones as a teenager. Jill also explains how huge the mob scene was when arriving home at a late hour after the Olympics, not to mention what she's up to now since leaving the sport competitively.</p>",
