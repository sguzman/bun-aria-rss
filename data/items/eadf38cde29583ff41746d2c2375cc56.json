  "description": "Steve Koomar, editor of Vigilante Investor and Curzio’s newest , is back with us today to talk about the oil market.  Steve has covered the oil sector extensively for many years. On this episode, he shares his views on the recent attack on Saudi Arabia’s Khurais oilfield. He also gives you some of his favorite energy names to buy right now... and which to avoid [10:41]. Oil prices affect just about every sector of the economy. But in my educational segment, I debunk the theory that higher oil prices will derail the U.S. consumer and crush corporate profits. I also give you a few tips on how to gain exposure to this volatile sector... without taking on a lot of unnecessary risk [30:41].   -------------------------------- Editor’s note: Steve Koomer is one of Frank’s most popular Wall Street Unplugged guests… and now, he’s a Curzio Research guest commentator.
