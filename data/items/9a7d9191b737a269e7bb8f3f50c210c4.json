Also instead of Charlamagne giving someone the credit they deserve for \"Donkey of the Day\" we had Azealia Banks stop by (who Charlamagne once gave \"Donkey of the Day\" to) where she spoke about why she once supported Trump, Cardi B, and made it known she is still not happy with RZA. </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
