  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Left is in mourning over the execution of a convicted murdered by the federal government. They accuse pro-lifers of being hypocrites because some of us support the death penalty. But today we’ll talk about why their position — that the death penalty is okay for babies but not for criminals — is really deranged and incoherent. Also Five Headlines, including Rush Limbaugh causing waves by bringing up the possibility of secession. I think that secession would not be a terrible idea, and I’ll explain why.
