  "description": "<p>1316 with Abby Martin</p>\n <p>Abby is a left-wing political lady with a great sense of humor and a reasonable mind. She's been on Rogan before and is always a pleasure. I really enjoy the way she speaks and puts her opinion across. She's a very smart person. I learned a lot reviewing this one.</p>\n <p>Enjoy my review folks!</p>\n <p>Follow me on Instagram at <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/joeroganexperiencereview\">www.instagram.com/joeroganexperiencereview</a></p>\n <p>Youtube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6ilK4Zrqk2ZeowbOo7pXgw\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6ilK4Zrqk2ZeowbOo7pXgw?</a></p>\n <p>Please email me <a href=\"mailto:Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com\">here</a> with any suggestions and questions for future shows..</p>\n",
