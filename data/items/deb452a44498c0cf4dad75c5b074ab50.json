  "description": "Do low tech attacks on soft targets suggest a change in the nature of both the war on terror and how our societies express their political dysfunction? Or is the mayhem that drives the news daily more or less what we have always seen in the past? On this episode of Deep State Radio, Georgetown Law School’s Rosa Brooks, Stanford’s Kori Schake and CNAS’ Julie Smith try to get past the headlines and answer what’s new about the period we have entered and whether or not our leaders in the White House are doing anything to help. Or are they making it worse? You be the judge.
