  "title": "PMS 2.0 068 - Chris Ballard, Rich Eisen, & Behind The Scenes Of The \"Greatest Draft Announcement Of All-Time\"",
  "description": "<p>On today’s show, Pat breaks down his trip to Nashville for the NFL Draft. From shaking hands with Roger Goodell and sitting in a forum with Hall of Famers like T.O. and perhaps the most electric human on earth, Rayfield Wright, to hanging out with Shane Lechler and TJ Yates in the green room and getting a picture with Reggie Wayne, to delivering the most entertaining and hilarious draft pick in NFL history, Pat relives the entire day. Also joining the show to discuss his draft and what he thought of Pat’s performance, is GM of the Indianapolis Colts, Chris Ballard. He and Pat discuss the players the Colts picked up, and what the atmosphere was like in the Colts’ war room for pick 89 (33:24-37:51). Also joining the show is friend of the program, friend of The Brand, and the voice of the NFL, Rich Eisen. He and Pat discuss draft weekend, and what Rich thought of the weekend as a whole. They cover the headspace of Giants fans after drafting Daniel Jones and all the negative backlash, Mike Mayock's first draft as GM of the Oakland Raiders, Rich’s vendetta with the band at the draft, his enthusiasm when calling the first punter drafted, and what he thought of Pat’s performance (48:24-1:10:22). The guys also dive DEEP into Game of Thrones as they discuss the Battle of Winterfell and whether or not it lived up to everyone’s expectations, and they briefly get into Avengers: End Game (WITHOUT SPOILERS). It’s a good one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
