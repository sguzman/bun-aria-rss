  "description": "<p>What a cool looking number huh? I am excited to say that Cory Brandan, the vocalist of Norma Jean, is on the podcast today.

It’s a very introspective and revealing look at a person who has been doing this for quite some time. I love Norma Jean and hopefully you will after this chat (if you already don’t).
