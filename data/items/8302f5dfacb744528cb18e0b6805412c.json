She got offered a wish by the Make-a-Wish foundation. She really wanted to go meet her favorite band, but her toxic mother forced her to take the entire family to a tropical vacation instead. OP gave in because she was just a child who wanted to make her mother happy, even though she really wanted to see that band. Wow, imagine stealing a dying child's last wish ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡ðŸ¤¡</p>\n",
