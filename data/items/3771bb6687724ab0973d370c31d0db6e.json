  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, illegal aliens and all Democrat experiments should happen in blue states and be paid for by people in those states. This idea of nullifying immigration law is a throwback to the Confederacy. The left supports secession as long as it's issue-based; arguing that the President (Obama) alone should have plenary power when it comes to immigration. When President Trump enforces federal immigration law then the left no longer wants him to have plenary power. Liberals like to pick and choose which laws to enforce as long as they trash Trump. The media claims to fact-check Trump, but they've never been interested in fact-checking Obama. Moreover, where are the Latino's on CNN? They demand diversity as long as it doesn't impact them. We are a nation of citizens, not a nation of immigrants! Then, Federal District Judge Carlton Reeves went on an anti-Trump rant charging the president with being a racist. It's grossly irresponsible for an arbiter of justice to make such incendiary statements. Later, we're up against radical progressive forces more than ever, we who love our country need to do what we need to do fight this fight through our work. Freedom of the press belongs to the people, not to the media. We need to learn from the great patriots who've gone before us and rekindle the American Spirit and press our case when we go into the public square, when our children set foot in their classrooms it will be them that are educated and make their case for liberty. Lastly, Dr. Thomas Sowell calls in to discuss his new book \"Discrimination and Disparities.\"\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
