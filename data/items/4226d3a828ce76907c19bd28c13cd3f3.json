  "description": "<p>We’re thrilled to share a brand new show with you. It’s called Million Bazillion and it’s all about money -- how we earn it, how we save it and how we spend it.<br><br>In the first episode you’ll travel back thousands of years to learn the ways people got what they needed before money was invented. Back then some people traded goods, others made pacts to share what they had. We’ll also meet the king who came up with the idea for coins. Plus, Kristen Bell designs her own money!<br><br>This show is a collaboration between Brains On and Marketplace. It’s hosted by Jed Kim with Bridget Bodnar.
