  "description": "<p>The NFL Draft happened and we finally feel normal again. Breaking down the first round, creepy Goodell, sob stories, great picks by a lot of teams, the Raiders being the Raiders and Athlete Couches being awesome (2:47 - 28:10). Packers Quarterback Jordan Love on being drafted in the first round and having his life changed forever (28:10 - 43:39). Fyre Fest of the Week and Mt Flushmore of non alcoholic drinks (43:39 - 71:36). We also welcome on a Dungeon Master who taught us about Dungeons and Dragons and let us play a live action game (71:36 - 104:49).</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
