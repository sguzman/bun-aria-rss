Given (as you probably know) that the Trump administration has not been particularly friendly to scientific advancement (see&nbsp;<a rel=\"noreferrer noopener\" href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/28/climate/trump-administration-war-on-science.html\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nytimes.com/2019/12/28/climate/trump-administration-war-on-science.html</a>&nbsp;for some examples), an unexpected and hurried executive order related to science policy was met with skepticism.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>Given that we still do not have full information about the content of the possible Executive Order, we are focused on ensuring consultation as it is developed so we have no additional comment now.&nbsp;</p><p>I should also mention that the decision to sign the letter was made following ASA’s policy for responding to time-sensitive public issues—with a vote of the President, President-elect, Past President, and Secretary. Needless to say, these elected leaders take this responsibility very seriously and do their best to reflect the interests of the sociologists who are our members. </p></blockquote>\n\n\n\n<h3>Photo Credit</h3>\n\n\n\n<p>By Martin Falbisoner - Own work, <a href=\"https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-sa/4.0\">CC BY-SA 4.0</a>, <a href=\"https://commons.wikimedia.org/w/index.php?curid=53567598\">Link</a></p>\n",
