  "description": "In 1977 Jennie Hicks seemingly vanished from her home in Carmel Maine, leaving her two children behind with her husband James Hicks... at least that was James’ story. Those who knew Jennie were adamant that there was no way she would have left her children, especially not with her husband who was known to physically abuse her. When law enforcement didn’t seem interested in actually investigating Jennie’s disappearance that left James free to do as he pleased, and a few years later would leave another young mother missing and presumed dead. <br>\n<br>\n\nGreat source for this case: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Tragedy-North-Woods-Murders-James-ebook/dp/B00XRCXSCU\" target=\"_blank\">Tragedy In The North Woods by Trudy Irene</a> \n\n<br>\n<strong>As always, thank you to our sponsors:</strong>\n\n<br>\n\n\n<strong>Shipstation: </strong>Use code, MORBID, to get a 60-day free trial!
