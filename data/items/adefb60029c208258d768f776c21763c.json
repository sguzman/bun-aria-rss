  "description": "Vote for us for Best Sports Podcast and Best Male-Hosted Podcast! http://podcastawards.com/app/signup/\nWhat are the biggest training camp battles we're keeping an eye on? How about the QB situations in Carolina and Seattle (1:25)? And let's not forget the Packers wide receivers (10:00). Are we overlooking Randall Cobb? We've also got some Elijah Moore talk (13:40) and news and notes (16:25) with a weird stipulation in Kyler Murray's contract ... There are plenty of players who could move up in the rankings over the next few weeks. Let's start at QB (21:30) with Jalen Hurts, Russell Wilson and Trey Lance. Then we move on to RB (26:35) and look at a group of potential #2 RBs. Adam makes a case for Breece Hall as a potential riser. Jamey thinks J.K. Dobbins could have some helium. At WR (35:15), we're looking at guys like Gabriel Davis and Jerry Jeudy plus the best value on the Chiefs. And at TE (39:00), will Cole Kmet or Pat Freiermuth make a jump in ADP? ... Jamey gives us more WRs who could be on the rise (41:00), and then we talk about training camp backfield battles (46:50)! How do we see the backfields shaking out for Atlanta, Buffalo, Houston, Kansas City and Seattle? ...
