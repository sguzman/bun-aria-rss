  "description": "<div>In March, 2011, an earthquake measuring 9.0 on the Richter Scale rocked Japan. 30 minutes later, the country experienced the largest tsunami in its history. And then came the blizzard. The three coinciding natural disasters killed over 15,000 people. In the moths following these events, hundreds of paranormal occurrences were recorded including ghost sightings and spiritual possessions. This episode tells some of those stories. <br>\n<br>\n<strong>LOOKING FOR MORE TCO?</strong> On our <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/TrueCrimeObsessed\">Patreon feed</a>, you'll find over 140 FULL BONUS episodes to <strong>BINGE RIGHT NOW! </strong>Including our episode-by-episode coverage of \"<strong>The Vow</strong>\" \"<strong>I'll Be Gone in the Dark</strong>,\" \"<strong>Tiger King</strong>\" <strong>\"Don't F**K With Cats,\" \"The Menendez Murders,\" \"The Murder of Laci Peterson,\"</strong> <strong>\"Casey Anthony: American Murder Mystery,\"</strong> <strong>\"Serial,\" \"The Jinx,\" \"Making A Murderer,\" \"The Staircase,\" \"Lorena,\" \"The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,\" \"OJ: Made in America\" </strong>and so many more! <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/TrueCrimeObsessed\">JOIN HERE!</a>\n</div>\n<div><a href=\"https://audioboom.com/posts/7703675-death-at-the-mansion-rebecca-zahau-part-1/edit\">Update Description</a></div>\n<div>\n<br>\n<strong>YOU GUYS WE LAUNCHED A NEW PODCAST!!</strong> Each week on <a href=\"https://www.centuriespod.com/\">\"Crimes of the Centuries\"</a> host Amber Hunt (of the Accused podcast) takes us on a deep investigative dive into a crime that was huge when it happened, but has been lost to time--and one you've likely never heard of.
