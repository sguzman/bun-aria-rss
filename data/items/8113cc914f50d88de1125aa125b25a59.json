  "description": "<p>The duo are joined in the studio this week by rapper and cast member of Love & Hip Hop Nya Lee. The girls have a chat about recycling exes and how it can possibly be connected to mental illness. Since Nya is a new Mom, we get into keeping your confidence after having a baby, how it changes the way you view your vagina and how you keep it spicy in the bedroom. Can Mom's be sexy? We dig into a debate about what's appropriate and not appropriate to wear as a mother/wife.
