  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, Article II, Section I, Clause 2 is clear that it gives the broadest power to the state legislatures to decide the time, manner, and place of its elections. In the contested election of 2000, the Supreme Court stepped in to defend the Constitution. In the 2020 election, they refused to intervene in the state of Pennsylvania's overreach. On Sunday, Justice Steven Breyer said that none of the cases brought met the criteria of having four Justices agree to take the case. This program has repeatedly made the case that the Constitution is clear that each state shall appoint the electors they see fit. Breyer was wrong and never cited which criteria he was referring to. Then, serial lying from the Biden Administration continues to go unchecked by the media. Even FDA officials are stepping down because they disagree with President Biden and Anthony Fauci's push for booster shots. Forcing people to get vaccinated is not the same as keeping a clean workplace under OSHA standards. Later, Secretary Antony Blinken is questioned by members of Congress and offers little in his responses on Afghanistan. When pressed on why nothing is being done to get Americans out of Afghanistan, Blinken said he was unaware of any such problems. Afterward, Curtis Sliwa, the Republican candidate for Mayor of New York City joins the show to explain how he's in the battle for a lifetime to save the City of New York. His opponent Eric Adams poses as a moderate when he's as far to the left as Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and was mentored by Al Sharpton. Finally, California is no longer the land of opportunity, and it needs to be helped by Larry Elder.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
