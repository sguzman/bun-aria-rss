    "media:description": "I throw King Bob-omb out of bounds. He then falls down until he reaches water at y=-11000, since that's the default value of the water level.\n\nI clip him out of bounds using the elevator platform's walls to push him all the way through the static walls of the course. This was partially inspired by a similar strategy used for HMC Metal-Head Mario Can Move! (https://youtu.be/QSxEhoimzX4). Also, note that simply trying to throw him or drop him while pressed against out of bounds doesn't work, because there's a failsafe that prevents him from being released out of bounds directly.\n\nUpdate: It seems that Plush already did this one time using a different method: https://youtu.be/CrdAxSy43aA",
