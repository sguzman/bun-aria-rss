  "description": "<p>The Therapy for Black Girls Podcast is a weekly conversation with Dr. Joy Harden Bradford, a licensed Psychologist in Atlanta, Georgia, about all things mental health, personal development, and all the small decisions we can make to become the best possible versions of ourselves.</p>\n<p>Over the years, there have been many public conversations around academic institutions failing to adequately support Black women, leaving many brilliant sisters feeling burned out, discouraged, and undervalued. At the same time, the desire for Black women to pursue higher education and secure tenure roles at Universities still exists, and rightfully so. Black women deserve a seat in higher education just like everyone else. The question is, for those who want to pursue higher education, what should they know beforehand? </p>\n<p>Joining me this week to discuss Black women navigating the academic arena are Professor Helen A. Neville, an Educational Psychology and African American Studies professor at the University of Illinois at Urbana-Champaign and Dr. Della V. Mosley, co-founder of Academics for Black Survival and Wellness. In our conversation, we break down the difficulties Black women face while pursuing  tenure track positions in academia, what Black women should consider in their assessment of whether to get into academia, and what other pathways exist to pursue higher education.  </p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<p>Visit our <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/shop/therapy4bgirls\">Amazon Store</a> for all the books mentioned on the podcast.</p>\n<p>Get updates about <a href=\"https://sisterhoodheals.com/\">Sisterhood Heals</a>. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Where to Find Dr. Neville</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://afro.illinois.edu/directory/profile/hneville\">Website</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Where to Find Dr. Mosley</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.dellavmosley.com\">Website</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/dvmosley/?hl=en\">Instagram</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Stay Connected</strong></p>\n<p>Is there a topic you'd like covered on the podcast?
