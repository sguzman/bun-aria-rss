  "description": "<div>This week, the gals discuss the motivations and methods of Munchausen's Syndrome and Munchausen by Proxy Syndrome. Pick up a bottle of Melodramatic Red Blend and tune in for the psychology behind faking illness, a mother-daughter duo who toe the \"by proxy\" line, and a recent case that involves a lifetime of lies, Miranda Lambert, and murder.
