  "description": "<p>Murderer’s Creek, Oregon was named in the 1860s, or so the story goes, after a party of eight prospectors who were exploring its banks were murdered. On tonight's show a group of hunters have a couple of run ins with a creature who has been watching them.</p> <p> </p> <p>Check out Justin's wife's podcast: <a href= \"https://linktr.ee/cdfishingusa\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The February Room</a><br /> The fly tying vise is like a campfire...bust one out, sit back, and listen to the stories unfold. Our vise is located in the \"February Room\", a Montana basement where the juices flow, and wild and wooly experiences are recounted. Hosted by Lauren Karnopp.</p>",
