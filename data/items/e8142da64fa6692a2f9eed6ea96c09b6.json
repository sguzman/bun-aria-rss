  "description": "<p>As the country continues to grapple with issues of race, privilege, policing, justice, and inequality, new voices are emerging with various solutions -- some more helpful than others. In the Washington Post, a columnist proposes that we eliminate all movies and TV shows featuring cops, while others urge the defunding of police departments. Meanwhile, controversy at the New York Times over an oped from Sen. Tom Cotton and calls for censorship. Robert Littal, the founder and editor of Black Sports Online, joins the show again to talk about Drew Brees and his comments regarding the America flag as well as the police killing of George Floyd (1:00:40). President Trump says some insane shit at a jobs press conference, so Kirk brings in notable right-wing apologist S.E Robinson to explain it away (1:32:40).</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
