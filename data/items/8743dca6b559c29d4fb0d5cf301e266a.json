Trigger warning: this episode contains graphic descriptions of desecration, and may not be appropriate for all listeners.</p><p><a href=\"https://static.macmillan.com/static/fib/stuff-you-should-read/\" rel=\"payment\">They don't want you to read our book.: https://static.macmillan.com/static/fib/stuff-you-should-read/</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
