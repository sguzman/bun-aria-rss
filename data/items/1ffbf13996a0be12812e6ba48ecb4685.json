This time we talk to Ian Renwick of Domaine de la Citadelle in the Luberon region of the Rhône Valley. I have \"known\" Ian virtually for years and have watched his career changes through interactions over email and social media as he moved into wine. Finally, he gives us the whole, fascinating story and then we get into SERIOUS dorkery -- discussing everything from rosé making to the politics of Bordeaux to whether or not ratings matter.
