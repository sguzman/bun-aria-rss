Create more tailored experiences for deeper engagement</h3><p data-block-key=\"fc7ur\">Over half of mobile consumers use Google and YouTube alongside other platforms when researching products or brands to try,<footnote id=\"722e02a1-56db-4ad8-9528-565e7434dde7\">[722e02]</footnote>and 91% say they took action immediately after discovering new products or brands.<footnote id=\"b8e752a3-9551-4f7d-9f92-4df038c6a9ec\">[b8e752]</footnote>Once they do, consumers also expect brands to deliver experiences that are <b>relevant and helpful</b>. In fact, two in five say they enjoy exploring Google feeds for shopping ideas because they are more personalized.<footnote id=\"1fe581d7-8b90-4dd1-84e1-b8d7d1165145\">[1fe581]</footnote></p><p data-block-key=\"7dv7u\">With <b>product feeds for Discovery ads</b> now <a href=\"https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/12561938\">available</a> in beta, advertisers can show shoppers items based on their interests and intent. Specifically, individual retailers can now use lifestyle images and short text with their Google Merchant Center catalog to deliver more relevant ad experiences. For example, a consumer interested in fitness and fashion might see sneakers in a variety of colors and styles from a new brand in their content feed on YouTube or the Google app.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"h-c-page\"><div class=\"article-image__is-caption h-c-grid__col--10 h-c-grid__col--offset-1 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-l--8\"><a class=\"article-image--link\"><video alt=\"Discovery Puma\" autoplay=\"\" class=\"article-image__media\" loop=\"\" muted=\"\" playsinline=\"\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_videos/FINAL_MP4_Discovery3Panel_Puma_1022.mp4\" tabindex=\"0\" title=\"An animated visual that shows an example of PUMA’s ads across YouTube, Discover and Gmail\" type=\"video/mp4\">Video format not supported</video></a></div><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption article-image__is-caption-image h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"odgfp\">An example of ads for Puma across YouTube, Discover, and Gmail.</p></div></figcaption></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"0srhm\">Puma switched to product feeds from standard Discovery ads to promote its catalog during key seasons, and saw a +46% increase in return-on-ad-spend while lowering costs by 19%. “Product feeds for Discovery ads offered more ways to expand our social-style assets across new platforms,” says Ashley Anderson, Senior Director of Digital Marketing at Puma. “Personalization and great performance made it easy to efficiently scale our spend.”</p><p data-block-key=\"8dc8o\">For tips to help you craft engaging Discovery ads with product feeds, see our <a href=\"https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/10547315\">creative best practices</a>.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3 data-block-key=\"2yqti\">2. Take an asset-first approach for bigger creative impact</h3><p data-block-key=\"483tb\">Keeping today's consumer engaged across platforms requires creative finesse at scale—and a multi-asset approach for campaigns like social and video to enable more visual and authentic storytelling. Nearly half of consumers say they are more likely to purchase a new product or brand they see in a video ad.<footnote id=\"1adffc2a-74c8-47f8-bd77-bd83ece5995d\">[1adffc]</footnote></p><p data-block-key=\"56bet\">You can now scale your assets to <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/creators/shorts/\"><b>Shorts</b></a>, YouTube's new short-form video experience, to drive visual momentum with consumers watching everything from workout clips to recipe walkthroughs. You can make the most of this mobile canvas by bringing your best vertical video and image assets to the Shorts experience with Video action and now Discovery campaigns for images.</p><p data-block-key=\"6dqf5\">We've seen this asset-first creative approach across campaigns drive better results: more than 60% of advertisers who combine Video action campaigns with Discovery ads see incremental conversions at or below their original cost-per-action.<footnote id=\"e34b9273-f192-4b33-87ee-9c259d45c78e\">[e34b92]</footnote></p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph_with_image\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap\"><div class=\"uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\" data-component=\"uni-article-paragraph\"></div></div></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"h-c-page\"><div class=\"article-image__is-caption h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3 h-c-grid__col--offset-2\"><a class=\"article-image--link\"><img alt=\"An image that shows the research insight about consumers’ preference for authentic and diverse creative\" class=\"article-image--large\" data-loading='{\n                \"mobile\": \"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/new_E02802031_Google_BPM_Ipsos_Consumer_Insi.max-500x500.jpg\",\n                \"desktop\": \"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/new_E02802031_Google_BPM_Ipsos_Consumer_In.max-1000x1000.jpg\"\n              }' loading=\"lazy\" src=\" https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/new_E02802031_Google_BPM_Ipsos_Consumer_Insi.max-100x100.jpg \" tabindex=\"0\"/></a></div><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption article-image__is-caption-image h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"s4bpr\">Source: Google/Ipsos, Consumer Feed Behavior Research, August 2022</p></div></figcaption></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3 data-block-key=\"ylobm\">3.
