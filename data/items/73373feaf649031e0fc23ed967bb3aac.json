  "description": "<p>Kirk Minihane has done what no political leader or Hollywood celebrity has accomplished in the last three decades. A tense, weary, polarized, fractured and disillusioned nation has been united like never before around a singular noble cause: #FireKmarko. Let it echo from sea to shining sea, from New York to L.A., from Madawaska to Panora -- #FireKmarko. In today's show, Kirk elaborates on the treachery of Kmarko's decision to collaborate with a known enemy of Barstool to hurt a Barstool brand. Kmarko's acts of infamy dominate The Rundown, providing Dave Portnoy, KFC, and Big Cat an opportunity to embarrass themselves by proving they have no idea what cancel culture is. Friend of Kmarko Ellie Schnitt says Kirk is \"on the wrong side of history\" and levels baseless charges of racism against him (0:29:39). Portnoy joins the show (0:40:14). Big Cat joins the show (0:50:34). KFC joins the show (0:56:30). #FireKmarko #FireKmarko #FireKmarko #FireKmarko\n\nYou can donate to the #FireKmarko fund here: KirkMinihaneShow.com</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
