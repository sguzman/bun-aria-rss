  "description": "When setting goals we often set large goals or make plans that can be somewhat unrealistic. They may not be unrealistic as far as your ability but unrealistic when it comes to other factors that play a part in you making it happen. In order to avoid being disappointed by not doing what you said you were going to do, you have to learn what things will keep you from making it happen. Are there certain emotions that keep you distracted from the goal or the plan ? Are there certain environments that will keep you from achieving the goal or keeping the plan ? These are just two of many questions you need to ask yourself in order for you to set realistic plans.
