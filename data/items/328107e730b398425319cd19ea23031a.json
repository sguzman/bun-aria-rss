  "description": "<p>We will be discussing The 'Siege' at Honobia! Bigfoots had been harassing a family who lived deep in the sticks in Honobia, Oklahoma for some time. The family had planted a lot of Austrian snow peas, a crop that deer loved to eat, so deer congregated on their property. The family then hunted the deer for food, mostly by spotlighting at night. They stored deer meet in a freezer in a shed outdoors. The Bigfoots were coming around the house mostly at night, attacking the house with rocks, banging on windows and doors, screaming and yelling, stealing deer meat from the freezer, damaging property, and just in general raising Hell. These incidents took place at a rural homestead outside the town of Honobia, Oklahoma in January of 2000. Some BFRO contacts went to visit the family. They stayed overnight and were impressed. Weeks later television stations and newspapers in Oklahoma mentioned the incidents but never told the whole story. Mid January, 2000 The first message received by the BFRO, from the uncle of the Honobia family: \"Too many incidents to mention here, please have someone contact us. This is no hoax and my brother is afraid for his family. This creature is getting bolder every time it returns. This thing is huge, walks upright, smells like a musky urine, burned hair type odor. He repeatedly comes back in the early morning hours after midnight and harasses them until just before dawn. It has on more than one occasion tried to enter their home. We don't know where to turn. Everyone thinks we are crazy when we mention it. Please, we don't know what to do but I do know that something needs to be done! There are stories we could tell that would make the hair stand on your neck...\"</p>",
