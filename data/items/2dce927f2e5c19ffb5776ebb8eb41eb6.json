  "description": "<p>We come once again to Advent, the beginning of the liturgical year and the great season of waiting. Christian life has a permanent Advent quality, for we are always expecting the coming of the Lord.

Our readings for this first Sunday of Advent give us some wonderful instruction.</p>\n",
