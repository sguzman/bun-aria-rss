  "description": "<p>Bill \"Gingery\" Burr enters the mommy dome for a lengthy, laugh-filled conversation. A true sportsman, Burr talked football with Tom until Christina started snoring.

We talk about shit-talking online and when people share too much -in person and on Facebook. Bill gets fired up about getting bodyscanned at the airport and why you should never use your debit card. Mike Singletary, Would You Rather, Bears and more! What type of denim are you wearing today?! </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>PS- don't forget to download Bill's new special for only $5 at BillBurr.com</p>\n",
