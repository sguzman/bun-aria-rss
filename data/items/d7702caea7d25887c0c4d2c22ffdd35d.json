Next, on his birthday, 9 year NFL veteran at defensive back, co-host of the Man-To-Man Podcast, Darius Butler joins the show to chat about everything going on in the NFL, Patrick Peterson going to the Vikings, if he's going to move positions, what the tape says on Sam Darnold, and why he thinks the Patriots might be back (49:47-1:10:07). Later, Pat and AJ Hawk chat about the different moves during free agency thus far, the bracket challenge, and much more before welcoming 3x Pro Bowler, All-Pro, CB for the Philadelphia Eagles, Darius Slay to chat about what he's got planned for the offseason, the situation in Philly right now, what he saw in Jalen Hurts last year that made him feel like they had a guy, his relationship with Matthew Stafford, and much more (1:10:09-1:44:03).
