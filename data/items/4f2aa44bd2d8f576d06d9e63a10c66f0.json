  "description": "<p>Stars are born in dense molecular filaments irrespective of their mass.\nCompression of the ISM by shocks cause filament formation in molecular clouds.\nObservations show that a massive star cluster formation occurs where the peak\nof gas column density in a cloud exceeds 10^23 cm^-2. In this study, we\ninvestigate the effect of the shock-compressed layer duration on filament/star\nformation and how the initial conditions of massive star formation are realized\nby performing three-dimensional (3D) isothermal magnetohydrodynamics (MHD)\nsimulations with {gas inflow duration from the boundaries (i.e., shock wave\nduration)} as a controlling parameter. Filaments formed behind the shock expand\nafter the duration time for short shock duration models, whereas long duration\nmodels lead to star formation by forming massive supercritical filaments.\nMoreover, when the shock duration is longer than two postshock free-fall times,\nthe peak column density of the compressed layer exceeds 10^23 cm^-2, and {the\ngravitational collapse of the layer causes that} the number of OB stars\nexpected to be formed in the shock-compressed layer reaches the order of ten\n(i.e., massive cluster formation).\n</p>",
