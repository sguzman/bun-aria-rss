  "description": "On Tuesday’s Mark Levin show, what has happened to Lt General Michael Flynn by Robert Mueller is an absolute, horrific injustice, and history will reveal that. There’s no reason he should have been charged, and yet Hillary Clinton, and all the rest of them are not charged, they’re celebrated.\nWhen the left raised over half a million dollars for Peter Strzok, who was fired for what he did to this country, his interference in our election, that can’t stand. We need to rally and help Flynn, after all, he spent 33 years protecting us. Also, Michael Cohen attorney Lanny Davis is on the payroll of a pro-Moscow Ukrainian oligarch, Dmytro Firtash, with direct ties to Russian President Vladimir Putin. Does Davis have a collusion problem? Later, Alan Dershowitz says Mueller is gearing up to subpoena President Trump. If Mueller issues a subpoena to Trump he will need to do it with backing of the DOJ and have it approved by Rod Rosenstein. If this happens it’s a frontal attack on our constitutional system.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
