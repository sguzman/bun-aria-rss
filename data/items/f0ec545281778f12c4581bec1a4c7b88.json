  "description": "<p><em>\"First of all, I wish to give an account of the attack and tell of the famous incident of July, 1924, when the \"Hairy Apes\" attacked our cabin. We had been prospecting for six years in the Mt. St. Helens and Lewis River area in Southwest Washington. We had, from time to time, come across large tracks by creek beds and springs. In 1924 I and four other miners were working our gold claim, the Vander White. It was two miles east of Mt. St. Helens near a deep canyon now named \"Ape Canyon\" — which was so named after an account of the incident reached the newspapers\"</em> - Fred Beck</p> <p> </p> <p>We also speak to a Police Officer who investigated a bigfoot attack on a person. He also discusses some strange calls he has been on that were Sasquatch related.</p> <p>The final guest talks about two encounters he has had. One of his encounters is very disturbing when he came face to face with a Sasquatch.</p>",
