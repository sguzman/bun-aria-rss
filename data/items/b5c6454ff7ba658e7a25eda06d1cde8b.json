  "description": "<p>A <strong>NASTY NINETEENTH</strong> in <strong>NASHVILLE</strong>? Oh Sadie is in for a treat. This past weekend was Sadies Birthday, and with her friends all being back in school she needed someway, somehow, and somewhere to get ROWDY ASF. When the same group of <strong>tiktokers</strong> she was with in episode 16 shouted her an invite to Nashville there was no questions asked. From blacking out 3 nights in a row, getting thrown to the wolves in the middle of <strong>tiktok drama</strong>, and finally meeting her <strong>crush</strong> since she was 16 years old, this episode covers it all. Listen in for the truth, the whole truth, and nothing but the mother f*cking truth.</p>\n",
