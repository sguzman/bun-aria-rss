  "description": "On today's show, Pat and the boys break down George Kittle's new contract and speculate about Travis Kelce's (which he signed shortly after we finished recording), the situation in Dallas with Dak Prescott not being paid still, Jerry Jones' comments about the situation, and whether or not everything that has happened this offseason has ruined the relationship between Dak and the Cowboys, plus they discuss where we currently stand with college football and what it all potentially means. Later, former Real World Cast member, executive producer for the Jim Rome Show, actor on Days of Our Lives, and current co-host of Good Morning Football, electric factory Kyle Brandt joins the show. Pat and Kyle chat about his new podcast, \"10 Questions with Kyle Brandt,\" which recently premiered with Aaron Rodgers as his first guest. Kyle also prepares a couple of questions for Pat, they chat about the current world of sports media and television, what Kyle's ultimate goal is, and whether or not he has ever considered going on MTV's The Challenge (23:22-47:36). To close out the show and send you into the weekend, 4x Pro Bowler and current Center for the Los Angeles Chargers, Mike Pouncey joins the program. Pat and Mike chat about what it's been like having Hard Knocks around the facility, how much different training camp is in the current world, what the testing procedures are like, having to police other players as a player rep, his relationship with Anthony Lynn and Tom Telesco, and what he expects from the Chargers as they turn the page and move past the Phil Rivers era (48:40-1:05:43). Don't forget to send in the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat with a picture of where you're listening to the show for the chance to win some free merch. We appreciate you all for listening, have a great weekend. Come and laugh with us, cheers.\n",
