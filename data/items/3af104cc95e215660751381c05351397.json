  "description": "In today’s podcast we look at an APT group that’s been active since 2011. We hear about the Quadrooter Android vulnerability. We take a look back at Black Hat, and look for some sensible perspective on cyber risk. We also read some discussion of the differences between espionage, crime, and warfare. The US Marshalls will auction SilkRoad’s forfeited Bitcoin later this month. Dr. Charles Clancy from Virginia Tech's Hume Center tell us what to expect from 5G cellular technology. And yes, there’s more Pokémon-themed malware in the Play Store.",
