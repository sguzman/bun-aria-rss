  "description": "<p>Awwww Yeah!</p><p>We had a conversation with one of our homies that happens to be a major player, the man who put the G in \"Gangster\" J. Prince. We caught up with J rolling in his Rolls Royce through his native 5th Ward Houston, Tx and had the opportunity to chop up a few things. We talked about his brother, \"Sir Rap-A-Lot\" who's presently sitting on a 22 year bid and even touched on Birdman to find out if he ever cleared his delinquent payment. J even broke down what it means to get a courtesy call vs an official visit.</p><p>We also discussed the opiate epidemic that has taken the country by storm and we ask when it became cool to be the fiend and not the dealer? This was not done in the studio, but we managed to get it done so you can hear the game that J. Prince gives on this episode. There are a few echo's here and there, and the sounds not perfect, but I'm sure that you will be inspired by this conversation. Press play and lets get into this G-Sh*t!</p><p><strong><em>By the way, make sure you keep it G and go out and vote, Real G's go to the polls!</em></strong></p><p><em>Make Sure You Subscribe To Gangster Chronicles Online</em></p><p><strong>Instagram</strong> <a href=\"shorturl.at/AFHN7\">shorturl.at/AFHN7</a></p><p><strong>Facebook</strong> <a href=\"shorturl.at/anLOX\">shorturl.at/anLOX</a></p><p><strong>YouTube</strong> <a href=\"shorturl.at/ehsOQ\">shorturl.at/ehsOQ</a></p><p><em>Hit Our Merchandise Store</em></p><p><a href=\"shorturl.at/mqEW8\">shorturl.at/mqEW8</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
