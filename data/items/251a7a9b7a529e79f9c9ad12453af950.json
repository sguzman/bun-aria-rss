  "title": "Everything I Don't Like is Racist and Sexist: The Talib Kweli Twitter Fight",
  "description": "<p><p>Talib Kweli is well into hour 50 of his anti-Kirk Minihane tweet storm, which began after we asked him to come on the podcast, but the rapper still refuses to come on for an interview. As the Minifan v. Kweli feud simmered all weekend, most of Barstool Sports remained oddly quiet (20:00). Minihane saw the Richard Jewell movie yesterday and, suffice it to say, not his favorite Clint Eastwood flick (41:35). Minifan President DEC tweeted out promotion for a Minihane Arch Enemy, so we can call him former Minifan President -- Minihane has a new nominee (49:40). Minihane evaluates Blind Mike's performance in theÂ Saturday's Mike and the Minifans (54:50). Jay Leno is the latest target of online outrage groups due to some hack jokes he told about eating dogs, but Eddie Murphy is poised to host Saturday Night Live without any PC outcry (1:10:20). The Boston Globe refuses to run advertising from a group opposed to the impeachment of President Trump (1:26:53). The Hallmark Channel pulls an advertisement featuring a same-sex couple kissing -- and then puts it back up (1:33:00). The Army-Navy game this weekend erupted in controversy after a few cadets made the \"OK\" hand gesture on camera (1:50:00). Plus, Minihane weighs in on the Fore Play podcasts fight with old guard golf reporters.</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
