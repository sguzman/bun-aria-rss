  "description": "<p>On the Categories (ca. 350 BCE), which purports to describe all the types of entities that exist. We mostly talk about substances, as A's presentation raises interesting questions about, e.g. the status of the species of substance, and the rest of the categories (e.g. quality, quantity, relative) rely on substances existing. So how exactly do these other categories relate to substances, and why does A divide the world the way he does?</p> <p>Part two of this episode is only going to be available to you if you sign up at <a href=\"https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/support\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">partiallyexaminedlife.com/support</a> or via <a href= \"http://itunes.apple.com/podcast/the-partially-examined-life/id318345767\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Apple Podcasts</a>. <a href= \"https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2021/10/09/ep279-2-aristotle-categories-citizen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Get it now</a> or <a href= \"https://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2021/10/16/preview-ep279-2-aristotle-categories/\"> listen to a preview</a>.</p> <p><strong>Sponsors</strong>: Get a free month of Great Courses lectures and lots of other great content at <a href= \"https://wondrium.com/pel\">Wondrium.com/PEL</a>.
