  "description": "<p>Portland, Oregon was known in Victorian times as the \"City of Roses\" and it has retained that nickname for over a century. The Portland Underground is known more readily as the Shanghai Tunnels. These tunnels that snaked through what is today Old Town and Chinatown, were used for practical business purposes, but they also serviced the seedy side of things in the city. Some parts of these tunnels can still be accessed today and they reveal a dark, cob-webbed maze that one would not want to enter without a strong flashlight and a good guide. Spirits are reputed to lurk here. Is it because men and women were carried off for human slavery operations through these tunnels? Was it the era of Prohibition that has led to spectral activity? Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of the Shanghai Tunnels! The Moment in Oddity was suggested by Corbin and features an Indonesian man who is 145-years-old and This Day in History features President McKinley being mortally wounded. Our location was suggested by listeners C. Laurel Boaz, Lisa Lindermann and Michelle Vaugh.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be seen here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/09/hgb-ep-147-shanghai-tunnels.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/09/hgb-ep-147-shanghai-tunnels.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p>Entwined Podcast article: <a href= \"http://www.entwinedpodcast.com/news/fingerfood10\">http://www.entwinedpodcast.com/news/fingerfood10</a></p>",
