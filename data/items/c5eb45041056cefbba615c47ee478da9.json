  "description": "<p>Traveling the world, especially for an extended period, may be a luxury you only dream about or can only do every few years. But, what if there was a way to make it happen? And, way sooner, and for less money than you ever imagined? Or, what if there's a way to evoke that sense of wonder and curiosity that travel brings out of us without leaving our immediate neighborhood?&nbsp;</p><br><p>What would it look like to keep the spirit of the journey or travel alive at home, using it to engage with and learn from the community that's right in front of us in a new and meaningful way? My guest today, Rolf Potts, is a firm believer in the life-altering benefits of travel - even if that means driving heading just a few blocks outside your normal routine - and how we can use adventure as a metaphor for life itself, and I'm excited to dive deeper into his philosophies and stories about life, travel, and wonder.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Rolf has shared much of his wisdom and travel stories in his books <em>Vagabonding: An Uncommon Guide to the Art of Long-Term World Travel</em> and his newest release, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3Cuj8jn\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Vagabond's Way: 366 Meditations on Wanderlust, Discovery, and the Art of Travel</em></a>. In our conversation today, we explore Rolf's strategies for doing immersive travel in a meaningful way, uncover the ways anyone, even those who can't travel, can use the vagabond mindset to disrupt their routines at home, and we touch on a few moments of adventure and curiosity that have shaped and inspired us.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p>You can find Rolf at: <a href=\"https://rolfpotts.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a> | <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/rolfpotts/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a> | <a href=\"https://pod.link/1315718369\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Deviate with Rolf Potts Podcast</a></p><br><p><strong>If you LOVED this episode </strong>you’ll also love the conversations we had with <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/good-life-project/id647826736?i=1000541910682\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Tim Ferriss</a> about centering humanity and love in work and life.</p><br><p><strong>Check out our offerings & partners:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li><strong>My New Book </strong><a href=\"https://sparketype.com/book/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sparked</a></li><li><strong>My New Podcast </strong><a href=\"https://pod.link/1610198312\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SPARKED</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.goodlifeproject.com/sponsors/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Visit Our Sponsor Page For a Complete List of Vanity URLs & Discount Codes.</a></li><li><strong>Indeed: </strong>Connect with your talent audience so you can make more quality hires faster.
