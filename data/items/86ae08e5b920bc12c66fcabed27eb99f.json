  "description": "<p>With young children, the years might speed by, but the days can feel like they go on forever. It's tempting to live for the next big milestone, fun moment, or restful break. Instead of asking, \"How can I be faithful in <em>this</em> moment for the glory of God?\" we find ourselves asking, \"How can I burn through the next few hours and just make it to bedtime?\" In this episode, Emily and Laura identify with this common trap, and discuss ways to keep our eyes on our primary mission. Passing along our faith to the next generation isn't just something that happens in the big moments. Instead, it's the humble collection of a million daily interactions over the course of a childhood. </p> <p>Like what you hear? Visit <a href= \"http://www.risenmotherhood.com\">www.risenmotherhood.com</a> for links to additional articles and resources on this topic. You'll also find more encouragement and truth on how to be an intentional mother that cares for and loves her children with eternity in mind. And if you get a chance, we'd love for you to subscribe and/or leave a review in iTunes!</p>",
