  "description": "<p>We formulate the problem of performing optimal data compression under the\nconstraints that compressed data can be used for accurate classification in\nmachine learning. We show that this translates to a problem of minimizing the\nmutual information between data and its compressed version under the constraint\non error probability of classification is small when using the compressed data\nfor machine learning. We then provide analytical and computational methods to\ncharacterize the optimal trade-off between data compression and classification\nerror probability. First, we provide an analytical characterization for the\noptimal compression strategy for data with binary labels. Second, for data with\nmultiple labels, we formulate a set of convex optimization problems to\ncharacterize the optimal tradeoff, from which the optimal trade-off between the\nclassification error and compression efficiency can be obtained by numerically\nsolving the formulated optimization problems. We further show the improvements\nof our formulations over the information-bottleneck methods in classification\nperformance.\n</p>",
