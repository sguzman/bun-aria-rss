  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, the CDC and President Biden told the country that masks are no longer required for fully vaccinated individuals, as much as Biden wants to take credit for this it was Donald Trump’s Operation Warp Speed that got us this far. It was the leadership of state Governors like Ron DeSantis who led Florida through this pandemic without destroying their economy or denigrating citizens. Then, Economist Milton Friedman taught that capitalism is a necessary condition for political freedom. The less economic freedom we have the less political freedom we have. This is why the left uses the climate change de-growth movement to change the American economic system through Marxist ideas. Now the economy is suffering, pipelines are getting hacked and ransom is being paid, and America's energy infrastructure is much less safe as a result. The Green New Deal will be much worse than this current cyber-attack. Biden is a human pandemic and the ransomware president! Later, the Muslim Brotherhood, a terrorist organization, is praising the anti-Semitic wing of the Democrat Party for abandoning Israel amidst an onslaught of rocket fire. Yet, Speaker Pelosi, Chuck Schumer, and Biden have done nothing to stop or condemn members of Congress for going against an American ally and rooting for terrorists. Synagogues were burned and rockets were fired at apartment buildings by Hamas. Interestingly, no mosques were targeted by the Israelis. Afterward, Bill O'Reilly calls in to discuss his new book, Killing the Mob: The Fight Against Organized Crime in America. \n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
