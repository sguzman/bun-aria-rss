  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, Joe Biden makes the grotesquely absurd claim that white supremacy is the most lethal threat we face as a country. We will analyze that claim and see if we can’t identify at least a few other threats that are perhaps a bit more urgent. Also Five Headlines including the woke mob randomly deciding that a certain actress is a racist Klan member. It’s not true, but then again this actress supported BLM prior to this, so I’m not sure I have much sympathy for her. And for a little change of pace, a Republican congresswoman says that someone came and sprayed offensive graffiti on her property. The Left is skeptical of the claim, for once. I wonder why. Plus, in our Daily Cancellation, we will cancel Kamala Harris. Again. All of that and more today on the Matt Walsh Show. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
