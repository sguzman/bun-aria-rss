  "description": "<p><p>Round 1: A North Dakota man got a phone call saying his son, a Marine, had been killed on active duty. It was all a scam to steal the man's identity. Gotta keep your head on a swivel.</p><p>Round 2: Chinese boots hate the military at times too. That being said, the Chinese government has certain penalties when you get out early. You cant just do it all willy nilly. We layout all 8 of those penalties and we'll vote if it's worth it or not.  </p><p>Round 3: The VA may soon be required to screen doctors and nurses and NOT hire the unqualified ones. I mean holy shit, really?</p><p>Round 4: We interviewed Army Major and Green Beret Jason Van Camp about his deployments, a mormon mission in Russia, and joining the polar bear club with some old Russian ladies! </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
