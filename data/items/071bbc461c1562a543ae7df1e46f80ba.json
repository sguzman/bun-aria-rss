  "description": "On Friday’s Mark Levin Show, there is no logic or connection between losing your ability to speak freely and having your security clearance removed. 12 former CIA directors wrote a letter condemning President Trump for stripping John Brennan of his security clearance – where were these people when Brennan was running the CIA, lying repeatedly and confessed only when his fingerprints were exposed. No rational Republic would allow such a poison pill like Brennan to continue to have security clearance while he gives aid and comfort to our enemies by using his position as former CIA director to accuse Trump of treason. Also, Republicans will get slaughtered in the midterm election if we don’t turn out in numbers on election day. The media and the Democrat party are doing everything to create hate, bigotry, and racism to turn out their base while the Republican ranks are divided and self-defeating. The firewall that is the House of Representatives can go significantly blue if Republicans don’t turn out at the polls; we can’t afford to lose this election.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
