  "description": "We're going to get updated dynasty rankings from Heath, but first we have to let him react to the Tyreek Hill trade. Heath left Hill out of his Top 12 at WR! And find out how he is ranking the Chiefs (9:30) after the trade. We also have a movie review (15:45) and some news and notes (17:15) including our thoughts on Clyde Edwards-Helaire as the Chiefs look for backfield help ... Dynasty time! We start with QBs (25:30) as Deshaun Watson is a riser in the rankings. Why is Heath a little low on Trey Lance? Then it's on to RBs (34:00) as we look at a big group of RBs who are approaching the end of their primes ... At WR (42:40), how old is too old? What do we think about the Broncos WRs right now in dynasty? And finally at TE (51:00), is it kind of a deep position in dynasty? Should Kyle Pitts be a Top 5 pick in dynasty leagues? ...
