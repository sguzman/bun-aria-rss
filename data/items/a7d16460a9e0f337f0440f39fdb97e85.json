  "description": "<p>A memory window of ferroelectric field-effect transistors (FeFETs), defined\nas a separation of the HIGH-state and the LOW-state threshold voltages, is an\nimportant measure of the FeFET memory characteristics. In this study, we\ntheoretically investigate the relation between the FeFET memory window and the\nP-E hysteresis loop of the ferroelectric gate insulator, and derive a compact\nmodel explicitly described by material parameters. It is found that the memory\nwindow is linearly proportional to the ferroelectric polarization for the small\npolarization regime, and converges to the limit value of 2 x coercive field x\nthickness when the remanent polarization is much larger than permittivity x\ncoercive field. We discuss additional factors that possibly influence the\nmemory window in actual devices such as the existence of interlayer (no direct\nimpact), interface charges (invalidity of linear superposition between the\nferroelectric and charge-trapping hysteresis), and minor-loop operation\n(behavior equivalent to the generation of interface charges).\n</p>",
