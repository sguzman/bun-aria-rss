  "description": "<p>Another delightful episode of SASF is here for you as Nate and Brian discuss the dustup from two previous episodes, focusing mostly on artistic temperament and motivation gone bad. But first, Brian decides what we need is not less but MORE of Nate's unvarnished opinions, and the guys head into a discussion of a book idea found on Twitter, and how to make a good pitch. You get a sneak peek at an upcoming Nate project as well... Also, if you have a question the guys would want to discuss, please send it in! The question tank could use a top-up, and that's not cheap here in Biden's America. Enjoy! And don't forget, if you prefer video, that's streaming only on Canon+.</p>\n<p>#StoriesAreSoulFood #artisticcalling #artistictemperament #bookideas #bookpitch</p>",
