  "description": "<p>“I looked at the vague but reassuring forms of the doctors around me. Abruptly my vision cleared. The sudden horror of what I saw rocked me as I realized I was definitely not in a hospital.</p> <p>I was looking square into the face of a horrible creature . . . with huge, luminous brown eyes the size of quarters! I looked frantically around me. There were three of them! Hysteria overcame me instantly.” — Travis Walton</p> <p> </p> <p>The Travis Walton UFO incident was an abduction of an American forestry worker by a UFO on November 5, 1975, while working in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest near Snowflake, Arizona. Walton reappeared after a five-day search. The Walton case received mainstream publicity and remains one of the best-known alien abduction stories.</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.travis-walton.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">http://www.travis-walton.com/</a></p> <p> </p> <p>____________________________________________________</p> <p> </p> <p>The man, the myth, the mysterious world traveler… as seen on TV….Maybe you caught the Travel Channel’s; Expedition Unknown episode of “Hunt For The Yeti” with Josh Gates and Adam Davies, if so, you’re certainly going to want to check it out.
