  "description": "<p>The NFL schedule has been released and we have hope. Notable games and a moment of silence to no Thursday night Jags/Titans (2:27 - 10:02). Earl Thomas got held at gunpoint by his wife after an orgy with his brother and Fyre Fest of the week (10:02 - 35:28). Number 1 pick in the 2020 NFL Draft Joe Burrow joins the show to talk about post draft life at his parent's house, team zoom meetings, and what Coach Duggs is doing wrong (35:28 - 54:59). Musician Mike Posner joins the show to talk about walking across the entire US, getting bit by a baby snake, the rise of his career and how weird fame was for him (54:59 - 85:40). We finish the show with the Mt Flushmore of minor injuries.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
