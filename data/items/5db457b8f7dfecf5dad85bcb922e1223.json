  "description": "<p>ONE NIGHT ONLY: Mike Kelton is such a radiant beam of light that Matt and Bowen are forced to swap out the negative \"I Don't Think So, Honey\" segment for the extremely positive and uplifting \"Yaz Hunni!\" segment! And YAZ HUNNI, Bowen does his about Hot and Spicy Cheez-Its! But if you think that's all this episode has going for it, then you are sorely mistaken. Of COURSE Matt lists the credits; of COURSE Bowen charms with the compliments - but then Kelton gets right into it with a 14 minute rendition of his famous parable, the \"Elevator Story\" (21:20). The story is so good that I've used it to make a point in my real life TWICE and the episode hadn't even come out yet. The story includes lawyers, Pride, the fire department, and Brian Faas so any good Culturista is going to want to check it out ASAP. But wait. There's more: Mike talks about the influence of Jagged Little Pill (34:38), our hosts breakdown Clueless vs. Mean Girls (39:30), and we get to hear about Mike's new show \"Shade: Queens Of NYC\" (44:30) which everyone is going to want to check out - it sounds likes essential viewing. Thanks to Mike for coming on! We all look up to you and appretiate you coming out! Enjoy the episode everyone...and rate 5 stars! - HPJ</p><p>LAS CULTURISTAS HAS A PATREON!
