  "description": "It's already December and we're making a list and checking it twice! Has your sewing space turned into Santa's workshop? If you're like us, we love making handmade gifts for everyone on our list, but sometimes it's hard to find the right project they'll love -- and that you can make quickly! We have some gift suggestions that may be just what you're looking for! We share ideas for organizing using basic office supplies -- perfect for any last-minute sewing items you're stashing away before company comes. We'll also be giving fast finish ideas for any holiday quilts or UFOs you're trying to complete before the end of the year. And on Getting Sewcial, we chat with Holly Lesué of Maker Valley, who talks about the evolution of her business and her love of scrappy quilts.\n\nFor more resources from today's show, visit the show notes here.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
