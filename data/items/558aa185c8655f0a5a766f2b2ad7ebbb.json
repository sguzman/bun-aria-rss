  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, Frank R. James was captured by the NYPD with the help of a citizen. He’s a systemically racist, terrorist slob that posted lots of White hate online. James, who has 11 prior arrests, will face multiple charges as the investigation continues. Despite all the censorship from Big Tech, James's social media posts, suggesting the killing of others, were never taken down by any social media platforms. Then, the Bureau of Labor Statistics announced that inflation is growing at the fastest rate in the history of record-keeping, and this does not include food prices, energy prices, and trade costs which have been excluded by Biden's economists. Later, the Russians are concentrating their efforts on a separate part of Ukraine to continue their offensive. The Ukrainians remain in need of aircraft and heavy artillery to fight back. Biden has rejected sending any helicopters or planes. Meanwhile, Al Roker says that the focus on climate change is getting lost by Putin's war on Ukraine. Afterward, US Senate Candidate Dave McCormick calls in with an update on his campaign. McCormick says Biden's bad policies and the war on energy are creating America's inflation problem. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
