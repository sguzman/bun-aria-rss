  "description": "<p>In this 122nd in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens.</p><p> </p><p>This week, we discuss cancellation for being woke, and for being medically woke. We discuss vitamin D, latitude, altitude, health and allergies.  We talk about teaching children how to think, not what to think, and about Margaret Mead’s retroactive cancellation. We discuss coming of age in Samoa, New Jersey, among the Amish, and in the era of Covid. We talk about what the Amish do and do not engage in, and whether everyone should be aiming to go to college. We discuss how many progressives have sold out our values in the last two years—and before—and risked reversing decades of actual progress. We talk about Nuremberg, and vaccine mandates, and a GenX revolution.</p><p> </p><p>*****</p><p> </p><p>Support the sponsors of the show:</p><p> </p><p>Sole: Beautiful shoes and carefully designed footbeds for healthy feet.
