  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, The Robert Mueller investigation is one of the greatest abuses of power in modern American history. There was no collusion between the Trump campaign and the Russians. Now members of Congress are trying to protect Mueller from getting fired but it is a clear violation of the separation of powers. This is a coup, an effort to undermine a legitimate President. If President Trump decides not to run for reelection in 2020, he should fire Mueller and pardon every one of special counsel Mueller’s targets. And then tell the House, ‘go ahead and impeach me,’ and the Senate, ‘go ahead and remove me,’ because this is simply unacceptable and somebody has to protect the Constitution. We know what's in the Constitution and the special counsel and his illegitimate appointment are not in it! Also, the Republicans should be passing every last piece of the President's agenda during the lame duck session, but instead Mitch McConnell is too busy passing the largest spending bill in US history. Then, the real reason GM is laying off workers is because of the steel tariffs. Higher steel costs raise the overall price of new cars and with new car sales costing more their sales are flat - now we see the effects of tariffs on steel. If this continues we'll see a terrible recession in a few years. Finally, Sean Hannity calls in to give his thoughts on the Mueller investigation.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
