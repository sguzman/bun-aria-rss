  "description": "<p>The town of Bodie in California is probably one of the best preserved ghost towns in America and the town describes itself as being in a state of arrested decay. There are over 100 structures still standing today with many of them dating back to the late 1800’s. The town is a State Historic Park maintained by the California State Parks System. In its heyday, it played home to gamblers, miners, gunfighters and prostitutes. It went boom and bust quickly and left abandoned. Some would claim that it is not completely abandoned. The spirits of those who lived during Bodie's glory years seem to still be around, as if waiting for another rich strike to bring the people flocking to the ramshackle buildings. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of the ghost town of Bodie! The Moment in Oddity was suggested by listener Kathy Webb-Thomas and features The Cadaver Synod and This Month in History features the Triangle Shirtwaist Factory Fire. We also have the 13th installment in the 3rd series of Tim Prasil's Spectral Edition! Our location was suggested by listener Debbie Miller.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes and pictures can be seen here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2017/03/hgb-ep-190-ghost-town-bodie.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2017/03/hgb-ep-190-ghost-town-bodie.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive producer and get stuff: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p>Music:<br /> <br /> Vanishing from http://purple-planet.com (Moment in Oddity)<br /> In Your Arms by Kevin MacLeod http://incompetech.com (Outro)<br /> <br /> Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br /> http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p> <p> </p>",
