  "description": "As more of the story of the 10-year-old girl who traveled across state lines to get an abortion comes out, Glenn explains how pro-choice ideas are eerily similar to the views of the first sadomasochist. Investigative journalist Megan Fox is investigating the truth of the 10-year-old girl, and she exposes how the story is even darker than initially reported. Former investment banker Carol Roth explains how inflation is inherently theft and what record-breaking 9.1% inflation means for the average American. Glenn explains how America's recent actions are affecting our relationship with other countries. The more we learn about the 10-year-old girl and her abortion, the more questions we have. Glenn predicts that something big is coming, judging from the Left's reaction to Roe v. Wade.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
