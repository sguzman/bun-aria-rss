  "title": "A non-linear PDE for XVA by forward Monte Carlo",
  "description": "Vladimir Piterbarg considers a non-linear partial differentiation equation that appears in a number of XVA-related contexts, including a one-way credit-support annex, credit value adjustment with risky closeout, option pricing with differential borrowing and lending rates, accounting-consistent valuation and constrained cash supply. In showing its solution is given as the minimum of solutions of certain related but linear PDEs, he develops an efficient forward simulation algorithm for any number of dimensions",
