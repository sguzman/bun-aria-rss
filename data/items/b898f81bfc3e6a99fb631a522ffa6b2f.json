  "description": "Kara and Scott talk at the annual Lesbians Who Tech Summit in New York City. Scott is dubbed a #LezBro. They discuss 48 state AG's putting forth an antitrust probe into Google. They love it. Kara comes with her new augmented reality glasses -- she thinks they're the future, Scott disagrees. WeWork's biggest investor encouraged them not to go forward with their IPO -- it's either because Pivot has gone so hard after them or because their S-1 is utter nonsense. Kara's win is Chrissy Teigen taking on Trump on Twitter. Scott's win is California's new law protecting gig workers. And they answer audience questions about how tech can be a better place for the LGBTQ community.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
