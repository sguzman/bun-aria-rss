  "description": "In today's podcast we discuss the consensus that Guccifer 2.0 didn't actually hack the Clinton Foundation. We hear how information operations might work during an election. The arrested NSA contractor's alleged motives remain unclear. The Mirai botnet got its exploitable vulnerabilities by downstream propagation of default credentials. The US Surgeon General discloses a breach. Dr. Charles Clancy from Virginia Tech's Hume Center considers policy statements from US presidential candidates. Joyce Brocaglia tells us about the Executive Women's Forum. And if you have a hard time listening to us, you may be suffering from \"security fatigue.\" Don't believe us—take it from NIST.",
