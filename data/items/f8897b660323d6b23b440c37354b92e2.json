  "content:encoded": "<p>Staying on top of recent work is an important part of being a good researcher, but this can be quite difficult. Thousands of new papers are published <a href=\"http://www.marekrei.com/blog/ml-nlp-publications-in-2017/\">every year at the main ML and NLP conferences</a>, not to mention all the specialised workshops and everything that shows up on ArXiv. Going through all of them, even just to find the papers that you want to read in more depth, can be very time-consuming.</p>\n<p>In this post, I have summarised 50 papers. After going through a paper, if I had the chance, I would write down a few notes and summarise the work in a couple of sentences. These are not meant as reviews &#8211; I&#8217;m not commenting on whether I think the paper is good or not. But I do try to present the crux of the paper as bluntly as possible, without unnecessary sales tactics. Hopefully this can give you the general idea of 50 papers, in roughly 20 minutes of reading time.</p>\n<p>The papers are not selected or ordered based on any criteria. It is not a list of the best papers I have read, more like a random sample. The only filter that I applied was to exclude papers older than 2016, as the goal is to give an overview of the more recent work.</p>\n<p>I set out to summarise 50 papers. Once I was done, I thought this would be a sensible place to summarise my own work as well. So at the end of the list you will also find brief summaries of the papers I published in 2017.</p>\n<p>Let&#8217;s get started.</p>\n<p><strong>1. A Thorough Examination of the CNN/Daily Mail Reading Comprehension Task</strong><br />\nDanqi Chen, Jason Bolton, Christopher D. Manning. Stanford. ACL 2016.<br />\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.02858.pdf\">https://arxiv.org/pdf/1606.02858.pdf</a></p>\n<p>Hermann et al (2015) created a dataset for testing reading comprehension by extracting summarised bullet points from CNN and Daily Mail. All the entities in the text are anonymised and the task is to place correct entities into empty slots based on the news article.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.marekrei.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/cnn_daily_mail.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1058\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://www.marekrei.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/cnn_daily_mail-300x151.png\" alt=\"cnn_daily_mail\" width=\"300\" height=\"151\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1058\" srcset=\"https://www.marekrei.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/cnn_daily_mail-300x151.png 300w, https://www.marekrei.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/cnn_daily_mail-150x76.png 150w, https://www.marekrei.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/cnn_daily_mail-768x388.png 768w, https://www.marekrei.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/cnn_daily_mail.png 951w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></p>\n<p>This paper has hand-reviewed 100 samples from the dataset and concludes that around 25% of the questions are difficult or impossible to answer even for a human, mostly due to the anonymisation process. They present a simple classifier that achieves unexpectedly good results, and a neural network based on attention that beats all previous results by quite a margin.</p>\n<p><strong>2. Word Translation Without Parallel Data</strong><br />\nAlexis Conneau, Guillaume Lample, Marc&#8217;Aurelio Ranzato, Ludovic Denoyer, Hervé Jégou. Facebook, Le Mans, Sorbonne.

On-line Active Reward Learning for Policy Optimisation in Spoken Dialogue Systems<br />\n</strong>Pei-Hao Su, Milica Gasic, Nikola Mrksic, Lina Rojas-Barahona, Stefan Ultes, David Vandyke, Tsung-Hsien Wen, Steve Young. Cambridge. ACL 2016.<br />\n<a href=\"http://aclweb.org/anthology/P/P16/P16-1230.pdf\">http://aclweb.org/anthology/P/P16/P16-1230.pdf</a></p>\n<p>The goal is to improve the training process for a spoken dialogue system, more specifically a telephone-based system providing restaurant information for the Cambridge (UK) area. They train a supervised system which tries to predict the success on the current dialogue &#8211; if the model is certain about the outcome, the predicted label is used for training the dialogue system; if the model is uncertain, the user is asked to provide a label. Essentially it reduces the amount of annotation that is required, by choosing which examples should be annotated through active learning.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.marekrei.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/dialogue.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1065\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://www.marekrei.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/dialogue-300x158.png\" alt=\"dialogue\" width=\"300\" height=\"158\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1065\" srcset=\"https://www.marekrei.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/dialogue-300x158.png 300w, https://www.marekrei.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/dialogue-150x79.png 150w, https://www.marekrei.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/dialogue.png 710w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></p>\n<p>The dialogue is mapped to a vector representation using a bidirectional LSTM trained like an autoencoder, and a Gaussian Process is used for modelling dialogue success.</p>\n<p><strong>5. Vision and Feature Norms: Improving automatic feature norm learning through cross-modal maps</strong><br />\nLuana Bulat, Douwe Kiela, Stephen Clark. Cambridge. NAACL 2016.<br />\n<a href=\"http://aclweb.org/anthology/N/N16/N16-1071.pdf\">http://aclweb.org/anthology/N/N16/N16-1071.pdf</a></p>\n<p>The task is to predict feature norms &#8211; object properties, for example <em>is_yellow</em> and <em>is_edible</em> for the word <em>banana</em>. They experiment with adding in image recognition features, in addition to using distributional word vectors.</p>\n<p>An input word is used to retrieve 10 images from Google, these are passed through an ImageNet classifier to get feature vectors, and then averaged to get a vector representation for that word. A supervised model (partial least-squares regression) is then trained to predict vectors of feature norms based on the input vectors (image-based, distributional, or a combination). Including the image information helps quite a bit, especially for detecting properties like colour and shape.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_734\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-734\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://www.marekrei.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/feature-norms.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-734 size-medium\" src=\"http://www.marekrei.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/feature-norms-300x200.png\" alt=\"Examples of predicted feature norms using the visual features.\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" srcset=\"https://www.marekrei.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/feature-norms-300x200.png 300w, https://www.marekrei.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/feature-norms-150x100.png 150w, https://www.marekrei.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/feature-norms-768x512.png 768w, https://www.marekrei.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/feature-norms.png 828w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-734\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Examples of predicted feature norms using the visual features.</figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>6. Adversarial examples in the physical world</strong><br />\nAlexey Kurakin, Ian J. Goodfellow, Samy Bengio. Google, OpenAI. ArXiv.<br />\n<a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02533\">https://arxiv.org/abs/1607.02533</a></p>\n<p>Adversarial examples are datapoints that are designed to fool a classifier. For example, we can take an image that is classified correctly using a neural network, then backprop through the model to find which changes we need to make in order for it to be classified as something else. And these changes can be quite small, such that a human would hardly notice a difference.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_737\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-737\" style=\"width: 1024px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://www.marekrei.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/adversarial.png\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-737 size-large\" src=\"http://www.marekrei.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/adversarial-1024x292.png\" alt=\"Examples of adversarial image\" width=\"1024\" height=\"292\" srcset=\"https://www.marekrei.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/adversarial-1024x292.png 1024w, https://www.marekrei.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/adversarial-150x43.png 150w, https://www.marekrei.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/adversarial-300x86.png 300w, https://www.marekrei.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/adversarial-768x219.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 1024px) 100vw, 1024px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-737\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Examples of adversarial images.</figcaption></figure>\n<p>In this paper, they show that much of this property holds even when the images are fed into the classifier from the real world &#8211; after being photographed with a cell phone camera. While the accuracy goes from 85.3% to 36.3% when adversarial modifications are applied on the source images, the performance still drops from 79.8% to 36.4% when the images are photographed. They also propose two modifications to the process of generating adversarial images  &#8211; making it into a more gradual iterative process, and optimising for a specific adversarial class.</p>\n<p><strong>7. Extracting token-level signals of syntactic processing from fMRI &#8211; with an application to POS induction</strong><br />\nJoachim Bingel, Maria Barrett, Anders Søgaard. Copenhagen. ACL 2016.<br />\n<a href=\"http://aclweb.org/anthology/P/P16/P16-1071.pdf\">http://aclweb.org/anthology/P/P16/P16-1071.pdf</a></p>\n<p>They incorporate fMRI features into POS tagging, under the assumption that reading semantically/functionally different words will activate the brain in different ways. For this they use a dataset of fMRI recordings, where the subjects were reading a chapter of Harry Potter. The main issue is that fMRI has very low temporal resolution &#8211; there is only one fMRI reading per 4 tokens, and in general it takes around 4-14 seconds for something to show up in fMRI. Nevertheless, they construct token-level vectors by using a Gaussian weighted average, integrate them into an unsupervised POS tagger, and show that it is able to improve performance.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_741\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-741\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://www.marekrei.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/brain.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-741\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-741 size-medium\" src=\"http://www.marekrei.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/brain-300x218.png\" alt=\"Neural activity by brain region, from Wehbe et al.

Cambridge. BEA Workshop 2016.<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W/W16/W16-0530.pdf\">https://www.aclweb.org/anthology/W/W16/W16-0530.pdf</a></p>\n<p>They improve an existing error correction system by re-ranking its predictions. The basic approach uses machine translation to perform error correction on learner texts &#8211; the incorrect text is essentially translated into correct text. Here, they include a ranking SVM to score and reorder the n-best lists from the translation model.</p>\n<p>The reranking features include various internal scores from the translation model, the rank in the original ordering, language model probabilities trained on large corpora, language model scores based on only the n-best list, word-level translation probabilities, and sentence length features. They show improvement on two error correction datasets.</p>\n<figure id=\"attachment_745\" aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-745\" style=\"width: 300px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"http://www.marekrei.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/W16-0530.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-745\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" class=\"wp-image-745 size-medium\" src=\"http://www.marekrei.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/W16-0530-300x129.png\" alt=\"Example output from the models.\" width=\"300\" height=\"129\" srcset=\"https://www.marekrei.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/W16-0530-300x129.png 300w, https://www.marekrei.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/W16-0530-150x65.png 150w, https://www.marekrei.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/W16-0530-768x331.png 768w, https://www.marekrei.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/W16-0530-1024x441.png 1024w, https://www.marekrei.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2016/09/W16-0530.png 1200w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a><figcaption id=\"caption-attachment-745\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Example output from the models.</figcaption></figure>\n<p><strong>10. Variational Neural Machine Translation</strong><br />\nBiao Zhang, Deyi Xiong, Jinsong Su, Hong Duan, Min Zhang. Soochow University, Xiamen University.

First, they model the posterior probability of z, conditioned on both input and output. Then they also model the prior of z, conditioned only on the input. During training, these two distributions are optimised to be similar using Kullback-Leibler distance, and during testing the prior is used. They report improvements on Chinese-English and English-German translation, compared to using the original encoder-decoder NMT framework.</p>\n<p><strong>11. Numerically Grounded Language Models for Semantic Error Correction</strong><br />\nGeorgios P.

While we normally represent token &#8220;25&#8221; as a normal word embedding, we now also have an extra feature with numerical value float(25). Second, they condition the language model on text in a knowledge base. All the information in the KB is converted to a string, passed through an LSTM and then used to condition the main LM.</p>\n<p>They evaluate on a dataset of 16,003 clinical records which come paired with small KB tuples of 20 possible attributes.

The embeddings are then used in a network for essay scoring, improving performance compared to previous methods.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.marekrei.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/An-Error-Oriented-Approach-to-Word-Embedding-Pre-Training.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1107\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://www.marekrei.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/An-Error-Oriented-Approach-to-Word-Embedding-Pre-Training-300x183.png\" alt=\"An Error-Oriented Approach to Word Embedding Pre-Training\" width=\"300\" height=\"183\" class=\"aligncenter size-medium wp-image-1107\" srcset=\"https://www.marekrei.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/An-Error-Oriented-Approach-to-Word-Embedding-Pre-Training-300x183.png 300w, https://www.marekrei.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/An-Error-Oriented-Approach-to-Word-Embedding-Pre-Training-150x91.png 150w, https://www.marekrei.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/An-Error-Oriented-Approach-to-Word-Embedding-Pre-Training.png 735w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></p>\n<p><strong>57.

The text is composed with an LSTM and then used to condition the image representation. The two representations are then compared to calculate a confidence score for the text being written in response to the prompt image.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.marekrei.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Detecting-Off-topic-Responses-to-Visual-Prompts.png\" rel=\"attachment wp-att-1108\"><img decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://www.marekrei.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Detecting-Off-topic-Responses-to-Visual-Prompts.png\" alt=\"Detecting Off-topic Responses to Visual Prompts\" width=\"774\" height=\"327\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-1108\" srcset=\"https://www.marekrei.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Detecting-Off-topic-Responses-to-Visual-Prompts.png 774w, https://www.marekrei.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Detecting-Off-topic-Responses-to-Visual-Prompts-150x63.png 150w, https://www.marekrei.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Detecting-Off-topic-Responses-to-Visual-Prompts-300x127.png 300w, https://www.marekrei.com/blog/wp-content/uploads/2018/01/Detecting-Off-topic-Responses-to-Visual-Prompts-768x324.png 768w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 774px) 100vw, 774px\" /></a></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.marekrei.com/blog/paper-summaries/\">57 Summaries of Machine Learning and NLP Research</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.marekrei.com/blog\">Marek Rei</a>.</p>\n",
