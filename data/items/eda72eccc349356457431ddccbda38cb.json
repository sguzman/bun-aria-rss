Our brain waves are active all the time because the brain is always active. <strong>The brain is active 24/7, 7 days a week</strong>! <strong>Our brain waves change in terms of how they move through the brain, which is based on what we are thinking, doing and feeling</strong>. When slower brain waves are dominant, we often feel tired, slow, sluggish, or dreamy, and are not able to process information or emotions very well. When the higher brain wave frequencies are dominant, we can feel wired or hyper-alert, like there is just too much going on in our brains. A healthy brain tries to balance these extremes.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Sign up to <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/drcarolineleaf\">Patreon</a> to get access to the full video and audio recording add-free, exclusive downloads, live Q&As, and more.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Read the show blog here: https://drleaf.com/blogs/news/how-to-balance-your-brainwaves-the-different-brain-frequencies-how-they-impact-our-state-of-mind-the-difference-between-the-mind-brain</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>OFFERS FROM OUR SPONSORS:</p>\n<p>-<strong>Chime: Get started with Chime today.&nbsp;Applying for a free account takes less than 2 minutes.
