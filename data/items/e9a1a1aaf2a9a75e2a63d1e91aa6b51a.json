  "description": "<p>&nbsp;In this episode of the <a href=\"https://thisisnotasociology.blog/category/digital-sociology-podcast/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Digital Sociology Podcast</a> I am talking to <a href=\"https://www.oii.ox.ac.uk/people/huw-davies/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Huw Davies</a> who is a researcher at the Oxford Internet Institute at the University of Oxford.</p>\n<p>Huw tells me about his research into young peoples' use of technology (and particularly the internet). His research has shown that there are significant social class differences between how young people of different social class backgrounds tend to use technologies. However, this doesn't always follow the patterns we might expect. He has found from his detailed research with young people that many might not be engaging with the school curriculum on digital literacy (for instance) but nevertheless have sophisticated skills and are quite entrepreneurial with online and creative activities.</p>\n<p>The two papers of Huw's we discussed were:</p>\n<p>Davies HC and Eynon R (2018) Is digital upskilling the next generation our ‘pipeline to prosperity’?
