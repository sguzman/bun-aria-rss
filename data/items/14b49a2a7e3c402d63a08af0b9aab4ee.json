But by far his biggest hit has been Natasha, Pierre, and the Great Comet of 1812 -- a musical adaptation of a small slice of War and Peace, with many of the lyrics taken directly from Leo Tolstoy's novel. It's tremendous theater, invigorating fun, and finally on Broadway. Dave and Todd talk about adapting great literature, his musical background, and his next big dare: a musical of Moby Dick.\n      \n      \n      \nLearn more about your ad choices.
