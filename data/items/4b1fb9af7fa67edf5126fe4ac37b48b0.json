  "title": "Mark Levin Audio Rewind - 2/11/21",
  "description": "On Thursday’s Mark Levin show, calling Donald Trump the \"great betrayer\" negates all the betrayals of Presidents Woodrow Wilson and FDR. Wilson was extremely racist, even by the standards of his time. The racist behavior of this man set back race relations by a hundred years. FDR's internment of Americans of Japanese descent was appalling. Also, the Lincoln Project has raised $90M and only one third has gone to making ads, the remainder has been divided by the founders of the organization and subcontracted consultancies that they control, according to the Associated Press. One founder, John Weaver, is facing multiple allegations of sexual harassment. They focus on Trump and ignore the crisis in their own organization. Later, a significant number of individuals want to contort the Constitution so that they can impeach a private citizen. Using their logic, former presidents and the deceased can be impeached as well. Of course, this is not what the framers intended which is why the impeachment clause is so unambiguous. Afterward, Andrew Cuomo aide admits that they hid nursing home data so feds wouldn’t find out. This is called a cover-up. Dr. Elaine Healy who called this program to shed light on this issue deserves a freedom award. \n\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
