  "itunes:summary": "If you include scientific words, there are over 1,000,000 words in the English language. The average person knows about 20,000 words, uses 2,000 different words a week and speaks about 16,000 words a day.\nYour words matter. However, what matters most is not the number of words you speak but the kind of words you choose and the purpose for which you use them. The apostle James tells us that although ‘the tongue is a small part of the body’ it is extremely powerful (James 3:5). In the passages for today, we see how your words can be used, just as the apostle James describes, for good or evil. Each day you have great potential: either to destroy or to build.\nIn our passages for today we see six keys to using your words for good.",
