  "description": "Have you ever met someone after seeing their hilarious social media posts and they've been, well, a bit disappointing in real life? Well, US figure skater Adam Rippon is nothing like that. He's great online and in person. Freestyle skier Torin Yater-Wallace has had so many setbacks but his inner strength has somehow got him here to PyeongChang 2018. Plus, episode eight also can't be without a nod to a special day in the calendar- Haeji Kim tells Ed what happens with Valentine's Day here in South Korea. (Re-sent without 10 mins of silence... Sorry about that!)",
