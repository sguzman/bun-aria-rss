  "content": "<p><em>This work is supported by <a href=\"http://anaconda.com\">Anaconda Inc</a></em></p>\n\n<p>To increase transparency I’m trying to blog more often about the current work\ngoing on around Dask and related projects.  Nothing here is ready for\nproduction.  This blogpost is written in haste, so refined polish should not be\nexpected.</p>\n\n<p>Since the last update in the <a href=\"../../../2018/09/05/dask-0.19.0\">0.19.0 release blogpost</a> two weeks ago we’ve seen activity in the following areas:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>Update Dask examples to use JupyterLab on Binder</li>\n  <li>Render Dask examples into static HTML pages for easier viewing</li>\n  <li>Consolidate and unify disparate documentation</li>\n  <li>Retire the <a href=\"https://hdfs3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\">hdfs3 library</a> in favor of the solution in <a href=\"https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/filesystems.html\">Apache Arrow</a>.</li>\n  <li>Continue work on hyper-parameter selection for incrementally trained models</li>\n  <li>Publish two small bugfix releases</li>\n  <li>Blogpost from the Pangeo community about combining Binder with Dask</li>\n  <li>Skein/Yarn Update</li>\n</ol>\n\n<h2 id=\"1-update-dask-examples-to-use-jupyterlab-extension\">1: Update Dask Examples to use JupyterLab extension</h2>\n\n<p>The new <a href=\"https://github.com/dask/dask-labextension\">dask-labextension</a> embeds\nDask’s dashboard plots into a JupyterLab session so that you can get easy\naccess to information about your computations from Jupyter directly.  This was\nreleased a few weeks ago as part of the previous release post.</p>\n\n<p>However since then we’ve hooked this up to our live examples system that lets\nusers try out Dask on a small cloud instance using\n<a href=\"https://mybinder.org\">mybinder.org</a>.  If you want to try out Dask and\nJupyterLab together then head here:</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://mybinder.org/v2/gh/dask/dask-examples/master?urlpath=lab\"><img src=\"https://mybinder.org/badge.svg\" alt=\"Binder\" /></a></p>\n\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://github.com/ian-r-rose\">Ian Rose</a> for managing this.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"2-render-dask-examples-as-static-documentation\">2: Render Dask Examples as static documentation</h2>\n\n<p>Using the <a href=\"https://nbsphinx.readthedocs.io/en/0.3.5/\">nbsphinx</a> Sphinx\nextension to automatically run and render Jupyter Notebooks we’ve turned our\nlive examples repository into static documentation for easy viewing.</p>\n\n<p>These examples are currently available at\n<a href=\"https://dask.org/dask-examples/\">https://dask.org/dask-examples/</a> but will\nsoon be available at <a href=\"https://dask.org/dask-examples/\">examples.dask.org</a> and\nfrom the navbar at all dask pages.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://tomaugspurger.github.io/\">Tom Augspurger</a> for putting this\ntogether.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"3-consolidate-documentation-under-a-single-org-and-style\">3: Consolidate documentation under a single org and style</h2>\n\n<p>Dask documentation is currently spread out in many small hosted sites, each\nassociated to a particular subpackage like dask-ml, dask-kubernetes,\ndask-distributed, etc..  This eases development (developers are encouraged to\nmodify documentation as they modify code) but results in a fragmented\nexperience because users don’t know how to discover and efficiently explore our\nfull documentation.</p>\n\n<p>To resolve this we’re doing two things:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>\n    <p>Moving all sites under the dask.org domain</p>\n\n    <p>Anaconda Inc, the company that employs several of the Dask developers\n(myself included) recently donated the domain <a href=\"http://dask.org\">dask.org</a>\nto NumFOCUS.  We’ve been slowly moving over all of our independent sites to\nuse that location for our documentation.</p>\n  </li>\n  <li>\n    <p>Develop a uniform Sphinx theme <a href=\"http://github.com/dask/dask-sphinx-theme\">dask-sphinx-theme</a></p>\n\n    <p>This has both uniform styling and also includes a navbar that gets\nautomatically shared between the projects.  The navbar makes it easy to\ndiscover and explore content and is something that we can keep up-to-date\nin a single repository.</p>\n  </li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>You can see how this works by going to any of the Dask sites, like\n<a href=\"http://docs.dask.org/en/latest/docs.html\">docs.dask.org</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://tomaugspurger.github.io/\">Tom Augspurger</a> for managing this\nwork and <a href=\"http://andy.terrel.us/\">Andy Terrel</a> for patiently handling things on\nthe NumFOCUS side and domain name side.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"4-retire-the-hdfs3-library\">4: Retire the hdfs3 library</h2>\n\n<p>For years the Dask community has maintained the\n<a href=\"https://hdfs3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\">hdfs3</a> library that allows for native\naccess to the Hadoop file system from Python.  This used Pivotal’s libhdfs3\nlibrary written in C++ and was, for a long while the only performant way to\nmaturely manipulate HDFS from Python.</p>\n\n<p>Since then though PyArrow has developed efficient bindings to the standard\nlibhdfs library and exposed it through their Pythonic <a href=\"https://arrow.apache.org/docs/python/filesystems.html#hadoop-file-system-hdfs\">file system\ninterface</a>,\nwhich is fortunately Dask-compatible.</p>\n\n<p>We’ve been telling people to use the Arrow solution for a while now and thought\nwe’d now do so officially\n(see <a href=\"https://github.com/dask/hdfs3/pull/170\">dask/hdfs3 #170</a>).  As of the\nlast bugfix release Dask will use Arrow by default and, while the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">hdfs3</code>\nlibrary is still available, Dask maintainers probably won’t spend much time on\nit in the future.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://hdfs3.readthedocs.io/en/latest/\">Martin Durant</a> for building\nand maintaining HDFS3 over all this time.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"5-hyper-parameter-selection-for-incrementally-trained-models\">5: Hyper-parameter selection for incrementally trained models</h2>\n\n<p>In Dask-ML we continue to work on hyper-parameter selection for models that\nimplement the <code class=\"language-plaintext highlighter-rouge\">partial_fit</code> API.  We’ve built algorithms and infrastructure to\nhandle this well, and are currently fine tuning API, parameter names, etc..</p>\n\n<p>If you have any interest in this process, come on over to <a href=\"https://github.com/dask/dask-ml/pull/356\">dask/dask-ml #356</a>.</p>\n\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"https://tomaugspurger.github.io/\">Tom Augspurger</a> and <a href=\"https://stsievert.com/\">Scott\nSievert</a> for this work.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"6-two-small-bugfix-releases\">6: Two small bugfix releases</h2>\n\n<p>We’ve been trying to increase the frequency of bugfix releases while things are\nstable.  Since our last writing there have been two minor bugfix releases.  You\ncan read more about them here:</p>\n\n<ul>\n  <li><a href=\"https://github.com/dask/dask/blob/master/docs/source/changelog.rst\">dask/dask</a></li>\n  <li><a href=\"https://github.com/dask/distributed/blob/master/docs/source/changelog.rst\">dask/distributed</a></li>\n</ul>\n\n<h2 id=\"7-binder--dask\">7: Binder + Dask</h2>\n\n<p>The Pangeo community has done work to integrate Binder with Dask and has\nwritten about the process here: <a href=\"https://medium.com/pangeo/pangeo-meets-binder-2ea923feb34f\">Pangeo meets Binder</a></p>\n\n<p>Thanks to <a href=\"http://joehamman.com/\">Joe Hamman</a> for this work and the blogpost.</p>\n\n<h2 id=\"8-skeinyarn-update\">8: Skein/Yarn Update</h2>\n\n<p>The Dask-Yarn connection to deploy Dask on Hadoop clusters uses a library\n<a href=\"https://jcrist.github.io/skein/\">Skein</a> to easily manage Yarn jobs from\nPython.</p>\n\n<p>Skein has seen a lot of activity over the last few weeks, including the\nfollowing:</p>\n\n<ol>\n  <li>A Web UI for the project.  See <a href=\"https://github.com/jcrist/skein/pull/68\">jcrist/skein #68</a></li>\n  <li>A Tensorflow on Yarn project from Criteo that uses Skein.  See\n<a href=\"https://github.com/criteo/tf-yarn\">github.com/criteo/tf-yarn</a></li>\n</ol>\n\n<p>This work is mostly managed by <a href=\"http://jcrist.github.io/\">Jim Crist</a> and other\nSkein contributors.</p>"
