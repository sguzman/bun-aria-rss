  "description": "<p>Indigenous voices have been left out of the conversation around climate change, even though they are among the first to face the direct consequences of global warming due to their interconnectedness with the environment and its resources. On this episode, we hear from Indigenous leaders working to uplift Native voices and bring generations of environmental wisdom into the fight against climate change. First we hear from Nikki Cooley of the Navajo Nation. As the co-manager of the Climate Change Program at the Institute for Tribal Environmental Professionals, Nikki combines Native teachings with Western science to advise fellow tribes on how to adapt to climate change. Then, host Carla Harris speaks with Red Lake Nation member Robert Blake, founder and CEO of Solar Bear, a full service solar installation company. Through education, workforce training and demonstration, Robert is on a mission to realize the economic and environmental benefits of including Indigenous perspectives within the transition to clean energy.</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://www.morganstanley.com/what-we-do/inclusive-innovation-and-opportunity\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.morganstanley.com/what-we-do/inclusive-innovation-and-opportunity</a></p><p><br></p><p><em>Disclaimer text</em></p><p><em>The guest speakers are neither employees nor affiliated with Morgan Stanley &amp; Co.
