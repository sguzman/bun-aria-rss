  "description": "We're joined by Sheriff John Bunnell ok no I can't lie to you like that because that would be a crime. Plus, nobody knows where Sheriff John Bunnell is these days. But if you want to hear us explain why Mark Dantonio does all his shopping at Home Depot, show you why Georgia will be leaving Auburn with the Civil ConFLiCT trophy, predict the rise of the Mark Richt Reformation, and explore Spencer's deep and real love of cheese, we do those things. Again, no Sheriff John Bunnell, though.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices\n      \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
