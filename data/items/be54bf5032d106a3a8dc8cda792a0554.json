  "description": "Adam laments to Drew on the failures of thick crust pizza and why there is no reason not to get thin crust. A caller asks Adam about his appearance on the Steve Hilton Show a couple of years ago. Adam remembers how smokers were slowly pushed out in small steps that eventually led to just smoking outside on the streets. A caller asks about the best heartburn medication to take in your 50's. Drew gives his take on the Amber Heard/Johnny Depp trial and how certain people can distort their own memories. \n\nPlease Support our Sponsors: \nAltoIRA.com/ADS\nJustWorks.com \nGeico.com",
