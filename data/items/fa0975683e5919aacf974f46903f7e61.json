  "description": "We all come to places in life where we reach our limits. You may feel like that today, or maybe there are obstacles you can’t overcome. The good news is that you’re not on your own. God is with you, and He is not limited by anything or anyone.You don't have to live life in fear or worried anymore because you don’t see how it’s going to work out. God’s ways are better than our ways. Under the open windows of heaven, God will cause you to accomplish things you couldn’t on your own. All you need to do is keep the faith. You will learn from Pastor Joel how being negative, complaining and living worried can limit God’s favor in our lives, but our praise causes the heavens to open and pour down like a flood.<p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
