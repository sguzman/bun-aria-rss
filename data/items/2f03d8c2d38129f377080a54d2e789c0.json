  "description": "Teaching Landscape: The Studio Experience (Routledge, 2019) gathers a range of expert contributions from across the world to collect best-practice examples of teaching landscape architecture studios. This is the companion volume to The Routledge Handbook of Teaching Landscape in the two-part set initiated by the European Council of Landscape Architecture Schools (ECLAS).\nDesign and planning studio as a form of teaching lies at the core of landscape architecture education. They can simulate a professional situation and promote the development of creative solutions based on gaining an understanding of a specific project site or planning area; address existing challenges in urban and rural landscapes; and often involve interaction with real stakeholders, such as municipality representatives, residents or activist groups. In this way, studio-based planning and design teaching brings students closer to everyday practice, helping to prepare them to create real-world, problem-solving designs.\nThis book provides fully illustrated examples of studios from over twenty different schools of landscape architecture worldwide. With over 250 full colour images, it is an essential resource for instructors and academics across the landscape discipline, for the continuously evolving process of discussing and generating improved teaching modes in landscape architecture.\nKarsten Jørgensen is Professor of Landscape Architecture at the School of Landscape Architecture in the Norwegian University of Life Sciences, Norway.\nNilgul Karadeniz is Professor of Landscape Architecture at Ankara University, Turkey.\nElke Mertens is Professor of Landscape Architecture and Open Space Management at the Hochschule Neubrandenburg, University of Applied Sciences, Germany.\nRichard Stiles is Professor of Landscape Architecture in the Faculty of Architecture and Planning at Vienna University of Technology.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
