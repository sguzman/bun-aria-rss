  "description": "<p>Our guest today, Doug Nordman starts every morning by checking the surf forecast to see how he’s going to spend the day. He and his wife are financially independent and live on the island of Oahu, which is a surfer’s paradise! Doug was able to achieve this amazing life by taking advantage of the financial benefits offered to him by the military, as well as through standard practices like budgeting and investing extra money towards retirement. He was enlisted in the Navy where he had a career as a submariner, and now he writes about money over at The-Military-Guide.com. And while most all of us have a chance to become financially independent, Doug believes members of the military are even better positioned for financial success. We’ve never had a member of the armed forces on the show before so we’re excited to hear some of the unique money challenges and advantages that members of the military experience.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Bodhizafa by Georgetown Brewing Company - a big thanks to Richard for donating this beer to the show!
