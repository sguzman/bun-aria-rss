  "description": "Five stories of a very savvy, completely unscrupulous turtle from Nigeria. He's a trickster we've met before, but he has an entire episode of semi-murderous turtle hijinks. Even though turtles are cute and seemingly harmless, they should not be trusted under any circumstances ever. You should also avoid going into business with them, when possible. The creature this week is the hyosube, from Japanese folklore. He's a crazy little guy who will give you fevers for just being polite. Sponsors! Away Travel, for toddler-proof (resistant? Is anything really toddler-proof) suitcases! http://www.awaytravel.com/legends and don't forget LEGENDS at checkout. Good old Lootcrate.
