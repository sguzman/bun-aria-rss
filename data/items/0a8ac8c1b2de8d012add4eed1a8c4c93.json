  "description": "<p>December 15, 2017. Toronto, Canada. Barry & Honey Sherman were wealthy philanthropists who were well-respected members of their community. But after they were found dead in their home, their business and personal lives were analyzed for clues to their murderer(s). Most clues seemed to point to Barry being the target. He had acquired and sold a family business which some believe cheated multiple family members out of their rightful shares of the company and his long running litigation with other pharmaceutical companies had some people wondering if bad blood could have turned to murder. Join us as we discuss an ongoing case that has plenty of clues but little evidence.</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
