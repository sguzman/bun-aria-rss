  "description": "In this episode we dig into Dori Molitor’s remarkable childhood - growing up with her 12 siblings, going to the One Room Schoolhouse, where most of the few other pupils were family members. We hear about she and her brothers and sisters worked on the family farm from their early days, even driving a tractor in a bikini to get a sun tan!. Her desire to have significance and impact was partly a reaction against her own father’s lack of self esteem - which manifested in him saying “well what do I know, I’m just a dumb farmer, and how her first ambition was to “be the secretary for someone important”. Her tenacity and persistence shine through, her early jobs, in Washington, big business and then her breakthrough into developing an independent marketing consultancy founded on the insight that brands that want to sell to women, better understand how women think.\nWe hear about the personal tragedy that led her to winding up her business, and then making a radical change into both reinventing herself and giving advice and coaching to women to help them find their purpose in life.\nAbout our guest\nAn entrepreneur for more than 30 years, Dori was the founder and CEO of WomanWise® specializing in uncovering women’s subconscious needs and aspirations. a featured speaker on multiple stages, including a TEDx Talk. Her opinions and articles have been featured in the New York Times, USA Today, Forbes and other leading publications. Dori thought she had it all – an influential voice, a successful career she was proud of, a loving family, and a wonderful lifestyle. And then, a tragic life-changing event woke her up to the fact that helping corporations market to women no longer gave her life the meaning it once did. Dori’s personal wake-up call led to a transformational journey of self-discovery and learning. She now inspires women to take ownership of their own voice, step into their power, and live the life they were called to live. At the age of 62, she launched a business devoted to guiding women to live a purposeful life that brings them happiness and fulfillment.\nDori’s TEDxTC talk Women Are Re-calibrating the American Dream.\nLearn more about Dori’s training and coaching: Unlock Your Purpose™ transformational experience; Aging with Power™ series for women \nConnect on LinkedIn.\nThe NBN Entrepreneurship and Leadership podcast aims to educate and entertain, sharing insights based on the personal story of our carefully selected guests aiming for the atmosphere of an informal conversation in a bar or over a cup of coffee.\nAbout Kimon Fountoukidis Twitter Linkedin\nKimon is the founder of both Argos Multilingual and PMR.
