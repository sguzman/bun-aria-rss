  "itunes:summary": "To look upon the cosmos is to gaze upon the ultimate gestalt. For some, space is the limitless horizon for human progress – it is our eventual destination. Others may see it as the realm of science fiction and fancy; a place where the imagination runs wild. And yet for many others it is merely a dark void – a vacuum full of stars. However, throughout the twentieth century and into the twenty-first, space has emerged as one of the most important policy areas in contemporary governance.\n\n\nFrom communications and climate science to the recent controversies surrounding the Trump administration’s campaign promise to build colonies on other planets, space presents a dynamic area of policy and international cooperation – and one that is generally pretty misunderstood.\n\n\nIs space the final frontier, politically-speaking? To answer this question and many more as it relates to the politics of space, we are joined this week by Kiernan McClelland. Kiernan is a PhD candidate with the Department of Political Science here at Carleton University specializing in the strategic application of space power in Canada and the politics of planetary defence.\n\n\nIf you’re interested in finding out more about Kiernan’s work, make sure to follow him on Twitter @canuckonaut. “War and Peace in Outer Space” is available for pre-order through Amazon and Oxford University Press.\n\n\n––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\nFollow us on social media:\ninstagram.com/cu_poli.sci\nfacebook.com/carletonu.polisci\ntwitter.com/CarletonPoliSci\ncarleton.ca/polisci\nThanks so much for listening, and an extra thanks to Sappheiros for use of his music for our theme.\n\n\nLights by Sappheiros @sappheirosmusic\nCreative Commons — Attribution 3.0 Unported — CC BY 3.0\nFree Download / Stream: bit.ly/LightsSappheiros\nMusic promoted by Audio Library youtu.be/-lbbHQbZNKg\n––––––––––––––––––––––––––––––\n🎵 Track Info:\nTitle: Lights by Sappheiros\nGenre and Mood: Dance & Electronic + Inspirational\n———\n🎧 Available on:\nSpotify: open.spotify.com/album/4KnoJn...\niTunes: music.apple.com/us/album/ligh...\nDeezer: deezer.com/us/album/88114572\nYouTube: youtube.com/watch?v=xq3_uCEtiJI\nSoundCloud: @sappheirosmusi...\n———\n😊 Contact the Artist:\nzachremick1@gmail.com\nsappheiros.bandcamp.com\ndeezer.com/us/artist/13811001\n@sappheirosmusic\nmusic.apple.com/us/artist/sap...\nyoutube.com/channel/UCxLKyBhC...\nopen.spotify.com/artist/5ZVHX...\npaypal.com/paypalme2/sappheiros\ninstagram.com/sappheirosmusic\nfacebook.com/SappheirosMusic\ndiscordapp.com/invite/Pk87yN9\ntwitter.com/SappheirosMusic\npatreon.com/sappheiros",
