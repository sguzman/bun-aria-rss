  "description": "<p>Meditation: Alert Inner Stillness (2017-12-06) - Behind the changing sounds, sensations, feelings and thoughts is an alert inner stillness that is purely aware. This meditation begins with accessing the receptivity of a smile, awakening through the body and opening the senses. We then sense the background of awareness and relax back to inhabit that wholeness. When the mind is distracted, the pathway home is a relaxing back, and the essential practice is non-doing, allowing life to be just as it is.</p> <p>Free download of Tara's 10 min meditation: \"Mindful Breathing: Finding Calm and Ease\" when you <a href=\"http://eepurl.com/6YfI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">join her email list</a>.</p>",
