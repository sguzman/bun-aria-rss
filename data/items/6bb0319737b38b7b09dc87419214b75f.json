Social bots have been used to infiltrate political discourse, manipulate the stock market, steal personal information, and spread misinformation. The detection of social bots is therefore an important research endeavor. A taxonomy of the different social bot detection systems proposed in the literature accounts for network-based techniques, crowdsourcing strategies, feature-based supervised learning, and hybrid systems.</p>\n<h2>Cite as:</h2>\n<p>Emilio Ferrara, Onur Varol, Clayton Davis, Filippo Menczer, Alessandro Flammini.
