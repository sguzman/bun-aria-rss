  "description": "<div>There was a time when Jeffrey Epstein was not a household name, but many people in certain social circles knew exactly who he was and what he was involved with for decades.<br>\n<br>\nWho did he work for and what was he doing? Was he a hedge fund manager or a pimp? Was he running the show or was Ghislaine Maxwell, the internationally known socialite that just happened to also be a rapist and child trafficker?<br>\n<br>\nThis episode focuses on Epsteinâ€™s role in the Brownstone operation that was being run down the east coast of the United States where very powerful people were put in compromising situations where their actions were recorded for later use by spy agencies and vicious psychopaths.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Sponsors:<br>\n</strong>Emergency Preparedness Food:<strong> </strong><a href=\"http://www.preparewithmacroaggressions.com/\">www.preparewithmacroaggressions.com</a><strong><br>\n</strong>Chemical Free Body: <a href=\"http://www.chemicalfreebody.com/\">www.chemicalfreebody.com<br>\n</a>Use the promo code: \"<strong>MACRO\"</strong> for a discount on all purchases!<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Online Connection:</strong>\n</div>\n<div>Website: <a href=\"http://www.theoctopusofglobalcontrol.com/\">www.theoctopusofglobalcontrol.com</a>\n</div>\n<div>Facebook: <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/theoctopusofglobalcontrol\">www.facebook.com/theoctopusofglobalcontrol</a><br>\nTwitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/macroaggressio3\">www.twitter.com/macroaggressio3</a><br>\nTwitter Handle: @macroaggressio3<br>\nYouTube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn3GlVLKZtTkhLJkiuG7a-Q\">www.youtube.com/channel/UCn3GlVLKZtTkhLJkiuG7a-Q</a><br>\nApple Podcasts: <a href=\"https://apple.co/2LjTwu5\">https://apple.co/2LjTwu5</a><br>\n<br>\n<strong>Purchase \"The Octopus Of Global Control\"<br>\n</strong>Amazon:<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3aEFFcr\">https://amzn.to/3aEFFcr</a><br>\nBarnes & Noble: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/39vdKeQ\">https://bit.ly/39vdKeQ</a>\n</div>\n",
