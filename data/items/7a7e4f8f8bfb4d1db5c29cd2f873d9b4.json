  "description": "In today's podcast, we hear that LuckyMouse has crept into an unnamed Central Asian house. Dixons Carphone data exposure presents complex legal and regulatory issues—it's the first big incident since GDPR came into effect. \"Lazy State\" is another CPU speculative execution bug. The US Congress doesn't care for ZTE, Australia's government is wary of Huawei, and the EU doesn't like Kaspersky at all. If you didn't like the end of net neutrality, wait until you get a load of the proposed EU Copyright Regulation's Article 13. More hacking expected from Pyongyang. Dr. Charles Clancy from VA Tech, discussing research on antifragile communications. Guest is Stacey Smith from CAMI on MD's legislation supporting cyber security businesses.",
