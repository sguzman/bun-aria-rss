  "description": "<p>Tuesday 9/5 - Today on the show after a discussion about how Issa reacted from a man that released himself on her face on the show \"Insecure\", we opened up the phone lines to see if our listeners thought what he did was disrespectful or not. Moreover, one of our listeners that happened to be our intern spoke how disrespectful it was, and in that discussion we learned about her age, which turned into another topic of discussion. We learned that she is 33 years old which can seem odd to many, though their has been bumps and turns during her path which brought a delay on reaching certain goals at a certain age. So we opened up the phone lines for our listeners that had similar stories to our intern. Also, Charlamagne gave \"Donkey of the Day\" to a police officer for abusing his power. </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
