  "description": "<p>On W.V.O. Quine's \"On What There Is\" (1948) and \"Two Dogmas of Empiricism\" (1951). What kind of metaphysics is compatible with science? Quine sees science and philosophy as one and the same enterprise, and he objects to ontologies that include types of entities that science can't, even in principle, study. Also, troubles with the concept of synonymy, i.e. \"same meaning.\" With guest Matt Teichman. <a href= \"http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2012/11/21/episode-66-quine-on-linguistic-meaning-and-science-2/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Get the full discussion at partiallyexaminedlife.com.</a></p>",
