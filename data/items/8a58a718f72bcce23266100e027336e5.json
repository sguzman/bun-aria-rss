As he crossed 52nd Street, a 20-ton bus made a right turn from the middle lane. The bus didn't just hit him, it dragged his body completely underneath, where Matt was then quite literally impaled&nbsp;by his bike.</p><p>After receiving&nbsp;68 units of blood in the first 40 hours post-accident, Matt spent the next month in a coma.</p><p>When he woke up, the doctors told him he was facing a one percent chance of survival.</p><p>Matt had other plans.</p><p>After a 5-month hospital stint and 40 surgeries in under two years, he did more than survive. He finally came alive.</p><p>The story of Matt’s accident and his comeback quest to tackle the 2008 NYC marathon just 3 years after his accident was first chronicled in an extraordinary story in <a href=\"http://www.runnersworld.com/runners-stories/second-life\" target=\"_blank\">Runner's World</a>&nbsp;by Charles Butler entitled <a href=\"http://www.runnersworld.com/runners-stories/second-life\" target=\"_blank\">A Second Life</a>.
