Moreover, Charlamagne gave \"Donkey of the Day\" to Bruce Rauner because he drank a glass of chocolate milk to demonstrate his belief in diversity. Also, since it is Monday we had one of our listeners shoot their shot at a crush, but this time instead of their crush picking up the phone it was their crushes spouse! </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
