  "description": "<p>Nikki is skeptical about Andrew attending his cousin’s wedding over the weekend. She also has concern for the elderly being forced to do things they don't want. After feeling insulted on some press interviews, she likely won't return to some local stations. Nikki is off to vocal surgery this week so she intentionally talks slower, Andrew and Noa aren't used to it. While her partner is away Nikki has been trying to use music to masturbate and at the same time has a new appreciation for \"Daddy\" Porn. </p>\n<p>ATTN Besties: We will be putting out one podcast per week for the next 3 weeks as Nikki recovers from vocal surgery.
