  "description": "<p>On today's show, we celebrate our 100th official episode! And we're having a rootin' tootin' good time heading to the Wild West town of Dodge City. We were looking for something special about the number 100 and came across this line that bisects the USA nearly in the middle vertically and low and behold, we found Dodge City sitting smack dab on top of it. The state of Kansas entered the Union in 1865 as a free state. The Civil War ended four years later and thousands migrated to Kansas, many of them veterans of the war. And then there were the outlaws and other famous names we know from the Old West, like Bat Masterson and Doc Holliday, and nearly all of them spent some time in Dodge City. Put on yer cowboy hat and boots and come with us as we look at the history and hauntings of Dodge City. Moment in History features the odd showdowns in Palisades, Nevada and This Day in History features the first run of the Panama Railway.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/01/hgb-podcast-ep-100-100th-meridian-and.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/01/hgb-podcast-ep-100-100th-meridian-and.html</a></p> <p>Help the show expand to more content and become an executive producer: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p> </p> <p> </p>",
