  "description": "<p>Tonight is a show about investigators.</p> <p>With four completed albums and his number five in the works Kris Allen is a true super star when it comes to his music and when it comes to his fans. As a native Texan Kris started his music career at a young age, but there were obstacles in the road during his journey that would prove to change the course of his life forever.</p> <p>Kris Allen is not just a super star within the music industry but he is also well known throughout the paranormal arena, as well as a dedicated Bigfoot investigator.</p> <p>Kris will be sharing with us an encounter he had as a child as Kris and his family watched in amazement as a Sasquatch was sitting in a tree watching them. Kris said “We thought it was some sort of strange monkey that got loose.” Kris owns a large farm in WV and talks about other encounters he has had with the creatures over the years. Kris says “One of the strangest things I have ever seen was a werewolf like creature that was walking towards my younger son while he played on the farm. I did not know what it was the only way I can describe it is it reminded me of a Hollywood werewolf, like you would see in the movies. As it approached my young son I went after it with my gun….”</p> <p>Check out Kris' website <a href=\"http://krisallen.com\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HERE</a>.</p> <p>I will also be speaking to David who heads the Independent Sasquatch Research Team based in Florida. David will discuss looking into a case featured here on Sasquatch Chronicles - <strong>SC EP:249 It had a look like “I’m going to kill you.”</strong> You might remember the episode: <em>Steve writes “I was completely frozen with fear I was 20 feet from the shoreline and this thing was about 10 feet in the tree line… I could not do anything except sit there and stare…. I watched it for what seemed to be forever but it was prob a minute as this thing was going nuts…. And as quick as it started it stopped, I was in the coast guard and went through several training and all but nothing could prepare me for what happened next…. I was at the point of fight or flight but there was no way I was gonna fight…. As I tried to gather my thoughts and pick up my jaw and figure out if I pissed myself or not …this palm branch moved to the side and I saw this …… Monster… Just staring at me.”</em></p> <p>The ISRT was established back in 2000 for researchers that want to work with a team of independent research people that are honest and hard working in the field.

We have many experienced field research individuals that have many years of field investigation experience.</p> <p>“Our common goal and responsibility as research analysts on this subject is to bring a deluge of evidence to the people.
