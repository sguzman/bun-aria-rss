You can find All Things Covered on Apple Podcasts, Spotify and wherever else podcasts are found. \n\nDeMarcus Lawrence is rich (again) after signing a new deal with the Cowboys. Fresh off the big contract, Tank joins Patrick Peterson and Bryant McFadden to discuss free agency happenings with Dallas, his path to stardom and what the future holds for the organization. First, we have to hear about his return to Big D which apparently was very close to not happening. Next, DeMarcus shares his thoughts on Randy Gregory's Tuesday flip to the Broncos and the possibility of Dallas adding Von Miller to their defense. What is it like seeing the franchise forced to trade Amari Cooper for business reasons? Next, Lawrence takes us through his football journey from growing up in South Carolina to playing JUCO in Kansas to D1 college football in Boise, Idaho. What was it like trying to fulfill the shoes of DeMarcus Ware? We learn the pressure D-Law put on himself as well as memorable moments from his rookie season including the \"Dez Caught It\" game. He continues to describe the differences between Dak Prescott and Tony Romo and what led to his breakout season in 2017. We then get into more contract talk. Tank tells us the stress of playing on the franchise tag before diving deeper into this year's free agency discussions with the team. Why did he feel disrespected by the Cowboys offer and ready to ask for his release? He's back which is all that matters and back to play alongside stud 2nd-year do-it-all defender Micah Parsons. DeMarcus shares what makes Parsons special, why he loves playing for Dan Quinn and how the Cowboys can get over the playoff hump.
