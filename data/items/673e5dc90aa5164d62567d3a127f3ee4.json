  "description": "<p>Scott Soshnick, Eben Novy-Williams and Michael Barr discuss a host of issues related to the business of sports, including a conversation with Ahmad Nassar, the chief executive officer of a newly created company aimed at helping athletes maximize the value of their name, image and likeness rights. Backed by private equity firm RedBird Capital, the NFL Players Association and the Major League Baseball Players Association have created OneTeam Partners, which will seek associations with athletes in all sports around the world. Prior to that conversation, the hosts discuss the weekend workout of exiled quarterback Colin Kaepernick, who had a private showcase with representatives from eight NFL teams in attendance. Kaepernick and the NFL clashed over the rules that would've governed the workout, prompting the player to change its venue shortly before it was scheduled to start. Also talked about is the carriage dispute that's keeping the Denver Nuggets and Colorado Avalanche from being seen locally, and ESPN's scheduling of the Sierra Canyon School boys' basketball team, which includes the sons of LeBron James and Dwyane Wade.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
