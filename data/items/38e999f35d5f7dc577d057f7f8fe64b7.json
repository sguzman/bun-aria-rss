  "description": "<p>A prosecutor is asking a judge to intervene after the parents of a suspected school shooter reportedly blew kisses at each other during a remote hearing. James and Jennifer Crumbley are each facing four counts of involuntary manslaughter in connection to the November 2020 school shooting in which their son, Ethan, is accused of killed four classmates. The mother of the 15-year-old Michigan boy texted a friend about her son’s demeanor hours before the deadly shooting, court testimony revealed. Jennifer Crumbley’s friend, Kira Pennock, 25, testified during a preliminary hearing about the texts Jennifer Crumbley sent her regarding a meeting she had with the school counselor hours before the shooting, according to The Detroit News. In the alleged texts, Jennifer Crumbley said she “s**t day” after the conference and included a photo of a disturbing drawing her 15-year-old son drew on a math assignment. Hours after the shooting, Jennifer Crumbley texted Pennock, “My son ruined so many lives today.” Fox News reported that during that fateful meeting, Ethan Crumbley convinced school officials that his concerning drawings were from a video game. The teen’s parents also refused to take him home, according to prosecutors. Jennifer Crumbley allegedly also texted Pennock that her son was having a “hard time” and “can’t be left alone.” Ethan Crumbley is charged with terrorism, first-degree murder, assault with intent to murder, and gun violations. He remains jailed without bond.</p><p><br></p><p>Joining Nancy Grace Today:</p><ul>\n<li>Darryl Cohen - Former Assistant District Attorney, Fulton County, Georgia, Defense Attorney, Cohen, Cooper, Estep, & Allen, LLC, www.ccealaw.com</li>\n<li>Dr. Jillian Peterson - Forensic Psychologist, Professor of Criminal Justice at Hamline University (St. Paul, MN), Expert on Mass Shootings and Violence Prevention, Author: \"The Violence Project: How to Stop a Mass Shooting Epidemic\", theviolenceproject.org, Twitter: @JillKPeterson</li>\n<li>Karen L.
