Joining the program is a Super Bowl Champion, 6x All-Pro, 4x Pro Bowler, NFL record for longest FG in a game, Baltimore Ravens K, Justin Tucker.

Next, NFL Network Insider Ian Rapoport joins the show for his weekly Rapsheet Wrap Up. Pat and Ian chat about the mechanics of Stephon Gilmore going to Carolina, Jaylon Smith signing with the Packers, what he's expecting from tonight's game, some different injury statuses around the NFL, and everything else we need to know going into week 5 of the NFL season (32:05-1:04:34). Later, Super Bowl Champion, 6x Pro Bowler, 4x All-Pro,  member of the Indianapolis Colts Ring of Honor, and current ESPN analyst, Jeff Saturday joins the program to chat about line play in today's NFL, his relationship with Peyton Manning, his thoughts on his time in Green Bay, how he navigated being in the NFLPA and helping spur the end of the NFL lockout, and some old stories from the locker room (1:04:38-1:32:04).
