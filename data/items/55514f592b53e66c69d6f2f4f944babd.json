  "description": "<p>Despite being one of the most common genetic disorders, affecting millions of people worldwide, cystic fibrosis evaded medical description for thousands of years after its first appearance. But the last century has led to a revolution in diagnosis, treatment, and our understanding of the disease. This week we talk all things cystic fibrosis, from salty sweaty tests to European folklore, from Bell Beaker culture to gene therapy. And we are honored to be joined by Jay Gironimi, author of “Can’t Eat, Can’t Breathe, and Other Ways Cystic Fibrosis Has F#$%*d Me”, who chats candidly about his experience with CF. Oh, and the best part? Jay, also the talented musician behind All Hallow‘s Evil, wrote a custom song specifically for this episode! We loved it so much we named this ep after it, and we know you’re gonna love it too.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You can find Jay’s book on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/B00F7VMKYG/ref=cm_sw_su_dp\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">amazon&nbsp;</a>in both paperback and digital versions, find the audiobook version on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.audible.com/pd/Cant-Eat-Cant-Breathe-and-Other-Ways-Cystic-Fibrosis-Has-F-d-Me-Audiobook/B00FY539IQ?qid=1382081349&sr=1-2&ref=sr_1_2\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">audible&nbsp;</a>and more of his writing at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://canteatcantbreathe.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">canteatcantbreathe.com</a>.
