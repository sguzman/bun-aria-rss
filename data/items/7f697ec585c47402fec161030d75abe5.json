  "description": "The British Green MP, Caroline Lucas, this week called for an 'emergency cabinet' of women from across the UK’s political spectrum to help prevent Britain from leaving the European Union without a deal. Women, she said, were better placed to deal with 'difficult, intractable problems'. So, is this true? Women have had to fight to gain a place in national politics in countries around the world, and when they make it, their challenges are far from over. Just last week, for example, the Kenyan MP, Zuleika Hassan, was ejected from the national parliament after she brought her baby into the chamber. So how does this compare to some of the other obstacles facing female politicians as they develop their careers? Do women govern differently to men, how does policy change when they're in charge and do women need to join the boys club to get ahead? Julian Worricker and a panel of guests ask - how do women change politics?",
