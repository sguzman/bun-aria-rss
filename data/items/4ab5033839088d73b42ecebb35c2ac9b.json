  "title": "Donald Trump Jr.’s Journey to Republican Stardom",
  "description": "<p>For much of his life, Donald Trump Jr. has been disregarded by his father. He played only a bit part in the 2016 campaign and when the team departed for Washington, he was left to oversee a largely unimportant part of the Trump Organization. But after The New York Times revealed that he had played an integral role in organizing the Trump Tower meeting between campaign officials and Russians promising information on Hillary Clinton, the younger Mr. Trump struck back hard at his father’s detractors and the media, finding a voice and an audience. Aggressive, politically incorrect and with an instinctual understanding of the president’s appeal, he has become a conservative darling and his father’s most sought-after surrogate. Today, we look at his rise to prominence. Guest: Jason Zengerle, a writer at large for The New York Times Magazine. </p><p>For more information on today’s episode, visit <a href=\"http://nytimes.com/thedaily?smid=pc-thedaily\" target=\"_blank\">nytimes.com/thedaily </a></p><p>Background reading: </p><ul><li>Read Jason Zengerle’s account of how Donald Trump Jr.’s became his father’s<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2020/08/24/magazine/donald-trump-jr.html?smid=pc-thedaily\" target=\"_blank\"> most valuable political weapon.</a></li></ul>\n",
