  "title": "#346: How Law Enforcement Can Help Victims of Color: The Building Bridges Project - Part 2",
  "description": "<p>We continue our interview with the Building Bridges Project team leaders Richard Washington and Marianna Wells — a program of the National Center for Victims of Crime. Richard points out that while there is a legacy of communities and families feeling uncomfortable reporting crimes to law enforcement — all it can take is ONE law enforcement officer who is&nbsp;trained and trauma informed&nbsp;to help make someone come forward with information about a crime. Support of victims and witnesses is critical. Laura talks about how accountability is important and that is what leads to trust. Jim explains how language and communication are critical skills in rapport building. Lisa wonders if communities don’t only mistrust police, but also fear retaliation for reporting crime.&nbsp;</p><p>To find out more about Building Bridges:</p><p><a href=\"https://victimsofcrime.org/building-bridges-project/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://victimsofcrime.org/building-bridges-project/</a></p><p>If you are a victim of crime, please look at all the resources available from the National Center for Victims of Crime&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://victimsofcrime.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://victimsofcrime.org</a></p><p>#buildingbridgesproject</p><p>#nationalcenterforvictimsofcrime</p><p>#supportvictims</p><p>#supportwitnesses</p><p>#traumainformedtraining</p><p>#victimsresources</p><p>To see the clips used in this episode in their entirety click below: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jxal22JbeBA</p><p><a href=\"https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rebuilding-the-publics-trust-in-the-police/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.cbsnews.com/news/rebuilding-the-publics-trust-in-the-police/</a></p><p>************************************************************************************************</p><p>PLEASE SUPPORT OUR SPONSORS DURING THIS SEASON OF GIFT GIVING</p><p>THRIVE CAUSMETICS - Need to multitask your evening routine?
