  "description": "<div>When newlyweds Gail and Rick Brink failed to show up to their respective jobs on the morning of November 23 1987, the alarm was immediately raised. The couple’s bodies were discovered at the ranch house they had only just purchased. Both had been shot multiple times in the head, execution-style. The slayings shocked the quiet community of Holland, Michigan, and everyone had a theory as to what might have happened.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\nNarration – <a href=\"https://twitter.com/casefilehost\">Anonymous Host</a>\n</div>\n<div>Research & writing – Erin Munro</div>\n<div>Creative direction – Milly Raso<br>\nProduction and music – <a href=\"http://mikemigas.com/\">Mike Migas</a>\n</div>\n<div>Music – <a href=\"http://www.andrewjoslynmusic.com/\">Andrew D.B.
