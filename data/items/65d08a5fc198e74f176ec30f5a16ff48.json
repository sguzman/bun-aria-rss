  "description": "<p>The blue check quest to censor Joe Rogan might be working. Clay maps out a hypothetical plan for Rogan if he were to get fired, which he says could be even more beneficial to Rogan than his current deal. Whoopi Goldberg says the Holocaust had nothing to do with race. Although he said he's heard Goldberg is a nice person and didn't mean harm, Buck says that statement is, of course, outrageous. The Republican Party should stand for freedom and liberty. Today's liberals don't believe in liberty. Bill Maher discovers the left has lost their mind. Maher said he shouldn't be a hero at Fox News, he should be a hero to the left, but it's impossible in this political climate.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
