  "description": "<p>In this paper, we present the two-loop correction to scattering amplitudes in\nthree-dimensional $\\mathcal{N}=6$ Chern-Simons matter theory. We use\neight-point case as our main example, but the method generalizes to all\nmultiplicities. The integrand is completely fixed by dual conformal symmetry,\nmaximal cuts, constraints from soft-collinear behavior and from vanishing of\nodd-multiplicity amplitudes. After performing integrations with Higgs\nregularizations, the integrated results demonstrate that the infrared\ndivergence is again identical to that of ${\\cal N}=4$ super Yang-Mills. After\nsubtracting divergences, the finite part is dual conformal invariant, and\nrespects various symmetries; it has uniform transcendentality weight two and\nexhibits nice analytic structure.\n</p>",
