  "description": "<p>This week we’re diving into the topic of email and newsletters. For many artists, the thought of sending a regular email is daunting (what do you say? How do you say it?) Others haven’t even collected email addresses in the past.<br>\n<br>\nWe’re hoping today’s discussion will inspire you to get started and/or to crank up your current efforts. The truth is that email has an important role to play in your marketing mix. Yes social media is important, but when someone gives you their email address, they are taking a step closer to you - giving you a valuable opportunity to make and keep a connection.</p>\n<p>We share tips, discuss areas where we could improve, and invite you to sign up for both our newsletters, so you can experience what happens when you do. All this as well as Bake-Off chat, new studio news and the exciting nature of the creative cycle.</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/see-more/\">https://alicesheridan.com/see-more/</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/newsletter-artists\">https://www.louisefletcherart.com/newsletter-artists</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\">Buy us a coffee and support the podcast here&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/dashboard/episode/bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\">bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p>@alicesheridanstudio</p>\n<p>@louisefletcher_art</p>\n<p>See fuller show notes on our websites:</p>\n<p><a href=\"www.alicesheridan.com\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n",
