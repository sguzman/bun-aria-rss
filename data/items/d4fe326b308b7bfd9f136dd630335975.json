  "description": "What’s not to like about economic growth, you might ask? Well, quite a lot, it turns out, once we begin to examine how GDP and other measures of the economy are constructed, and once we see what they leave out (and perhaps just as troubling, what they leave in). Join us as we speak with David Pilling about his new book, The Growth Delusion: Wealth, Poverty, and the Well-Being of Nations (Tim Duggan Books/Bloomsbury, 2018), which helps us understand the problems with how we typically evaluate national economies and offers some alternative approaches even though each of those options presents their own challenges.\n\n\n\nStephen Pimpare is Senior Lecturer in the Politics & Society Program and Faculty Fellow at the Carsey School of Public Policy at the University of New Hampshire. He is the author of The New Victorians (New Press, 2004), A People’s History of Poverty in America (New Press, 2008), winner of the Michael Harrington Award, and Ghettos, Tramps and Welfare Queens: Down and Out on the Silver Screen (Oxford University Press, 2017).\nLearn more about your ad choices.
