  "title": "William Jamison Part 1: The Drive Home",
  "description": "<p>March 26, 1981, was just an ordinary day for 33-year-old William Jamison. He went to work at Haug Die Casting Company in Kenilworth, NJ, where he was the vice president of production. After work, Bill went to a restaurant for dinner. Bill’s next stop was the Chez Lounge inside Linden Lanes Bowling Alley in Linden, NJ. After spending several hours enjoying drinks and good conversation with friends and acquaintances, Bill left and stopped at the St. George Diner in Linden for a quick late-night meal. He arrived around 1 AM and left about 30 minutes later. That’s the last time that anyone ever saw Bill Jamison. It was like he had vanished into the night. Bill’s coworkers were immediately concerned when he didn’t show up at 8 AM as he usually did. One coworker went over to Bill’s apartment, but Bill wasn’t there. They decided it was time to contact Bill’s sister, Katie. Katie jumped into action. She contacted law enforcement and began calling all the hospitals in the area. More than 41 years later, Bill’s family is still looking for answers. This is a mysterious story that goes in many unexpected directions, from sightings of Bill several states away to the theory that this was a mob hit.</p><p>If you have any information about the disappearance of William Jamison, please contact the Roselle Park Police Department at (908) 245-2300 or the New Jersey State Police Missing Persons Unit at (609) 882-2000.</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href=\"http://theouai.com \" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">OUAI</a>- Go to <a href=\"http://theouai.com \" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">theouai.com </a>and use code VANISHED to get 15% off your entire order.</p><p><a href=\"http://shopify.com/vanished\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Shopify</a>- Go to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://shopify.com/vanished\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Shopify.com/<strong>vanished</strong></a><strong>,&nbsp;</strong>ALL LOWERCASE, for a FREE fourteen-day trial and get full access to Shopify’s entire suite of&nbsp;features.</p><p>IMPACT by Interactive Brokers- Download the app today and use code VANISHED to get $30 of stock credit.</p><p>Note: The podcast ad for the IMPACT app is unscripted and being recorded live.
