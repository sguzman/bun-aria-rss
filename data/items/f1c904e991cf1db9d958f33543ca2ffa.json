    "media:description": "I was born on November 27, 1940, in San Francisco's Chinatown during the hour and year of the dragon. My mother was of Eurasian ancestry making her a halfie and my father was an opera star who toured the US where, from a young age, I was exposed to the world of entertainment and when I was 1 year old, appeared in films alongside my father. In many ways, the camera became my first love but that was cut short when my family decided to move back to Hong Kong.\n\nMy name is Lee Xiao Long, or Bruce Lee and I broke racial barriers by becoming the first ever Hollywood martial artist in film.\n\n#brucelee #minutevideos #originstories",
