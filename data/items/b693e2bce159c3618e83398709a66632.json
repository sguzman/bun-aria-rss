Eric and his fiancé had hosted a small gathering at their condo. As the party was winding down and most of the guests had left, there was a disagreement. According to those present, Eric took a walk to cool off and never returned. On April 23, 2020, a hiker located human remains that were positively identified as Eric. Eric’s father, Randy Pracht, spoke with us recently for this update episode.</p><p>If you or a loved one is considering self-harm, please call the National Suicide Prevention Hotline at 800-273-8255.
