He argues that an inclusive growth dividend, pegged at 1% of GDP and paid to all citizens, would have major positive impacts on key development indicators.  And crucially, such a transfer is fiscally affordable for India, as opposed to Universal Basic Income, which requires spending of 4-10% of GDP.   <br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>Read \"An inclusive growth dividend: Reframing the role of income transfers in India’s anti-poverty strategy\" by Maitreesh Ghatak and Karthik Muralidharan <a href=\"http://personal.lse.ac.uk/ghatak/IPF_Ghatak_Muralidharan_2019.pdf\">here</a>.  </div>\n",
