  "description": "<p>What is hiding behind your Instagram photos of perfectly baked sourdough bread? First of all, all of the labor and time and knowledge it took to create it. Second, the strained and in some places broken food supply chain during the pandemic. And third, all of the money and countertop space that some have but most do not.
