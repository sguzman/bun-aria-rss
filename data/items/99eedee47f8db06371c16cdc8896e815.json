    "media:description": "Electromagnetic Waves | Electricity | Physics | FuseSchool\n\nYou may never have heard of the electromagnetic spectrum, but you would have heard of many parts of it and use them daily. \n\nThey are all electromagnetic transverse waves that travel at the speed of light. This speed is hard to imagine, but think of it this way: light can travel 8 complete circuits of the earth in one second.\n\nLet's take a quick trip along the spectrumâ€¦\n\n\nCREDITS\nAnimation & Design: Bing Rijper\nNarration: Dale Bennett\nScript: Bethan Parry and Alistair Haynes\n\nSUPPORT US ON PATREON\nhttps://www.patreon.com/fuseschool\n\nSUBSCRIBE to the FuseSchool YouTube channel for many more educational videos.
