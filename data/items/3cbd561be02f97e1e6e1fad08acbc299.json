  "description": "Matthew Hoffman. November 10, 2010. Howard, Ohio. Matthew Hoffman was an unemployed tree surgeon who entered a home to rob it. Or so he says. Three people ended up dead and a fourth, a 13 year-old girl, kidnapped and sexually assaulted for days before being rescued by a SWAT team. This seems like an open & shut case, but questions remain. What drove Hoffman to do what he did? Was it a robbery gone wrong or had he been stalking the young girl? And why is he so obsessed with trees? A true crime case.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
