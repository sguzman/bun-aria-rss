  "description": "<p>Ever spotted a strange object in the sky? According to a recent report released by the U.S. government, nearly 150 aerial objects observed between 2004 and 2021 remain unidentified—with the exception of one large deflated balloon. The sightings of these objects, once called UFOs and now referred to as Unidentified Aerial Phenomena (UAP), can have a number of reasonable explanations. Cloud formations, Venus shining brightly in the night sky, or the occasional recon aircraft or government-led missile test can all be mistaken for a UAP. But what if there’s another explanation out there? Could extraterrestrial intelligence explain some sightings? To find out, Dr. Alok Patel explores the possibilities with an astrophysicist and a NASA engineer. Together, these space exploration and research innovators remind us that the truth is out there—we just need to look to science.</p>",
