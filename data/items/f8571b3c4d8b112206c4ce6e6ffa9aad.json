    "media:description": "Brought to you by SIGGRAPH University, this three-part webinar series will teach you all about machine learning and neural networks. Rajesh Sharma (VP of Engineering, Spire Animation Studios) has designed three intermediate-level workshops for attendees to gain a strong understanding of the basic principles of machine learning and neural networks. Using a mix of theory and hands-on practice Rajesh will help you build intuition around several topics with easy to understand explanations and examples from some of the most commonly used algorithms and models including Autoencoders, CNN, GAN, and Transformers. Brought to you by SIGGRAPH University.\n\nWebinar Session Part 2 Course Files: \nhttps://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1iGMmCuegovHlziOnJxalyyZiEMaFwahT?usp=sharing\n\nVisit our website to learn more about upcoming SIGGRAPH Now educational opportunities: https://s2022.siggraph.org/siggraph-now-supplemental-learning/\n\n#SIGGRAPHNow #SIGGRAPHUniversity #ML #NeuralNetworks #RajeshSharma",
