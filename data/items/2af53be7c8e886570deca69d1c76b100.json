  "description": "Oh Muses! In this episode we tell the tale of the inhabitants of Tartarus, and their dastardly deeds. We come across violations of hospitality, someone who tries to cheat death, and people who are just plain mean. Some people get eaten, and we all learn some lessons. So listen up! -- Seriously, though, this one has a lot of cannibalism. Younger listeners may want to skip it. \n---\nNational Geographic Kids Greeking Out is a kid-friendly retelling of some of the best stories from Greek Mythology. Check out https://bit.ly/GO-ZTM to meet Zeus the Hamster and his friends-Athena the Cat, Ares the Pug, Demeter the grasshopper, and many more-who also listen to the Greeking Out podcast. Watch a video, read an excerpt, or check out the truth behind the stories!",
