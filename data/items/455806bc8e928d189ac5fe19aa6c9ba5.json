Each Wednesday we’ll bring you a virtual conversation over Zoom, which will be released as an episode of Intersectionality Matters! the following week.\n\nRead full bios of panelists here: aapf.org/under-the-blacklight-covid19\n\n\nHosted by Kimberlé Crenshaw (@sandylocks)\nProduced and Edited by Julia Sharpe-Levine\nAdditional support provided by Andrew Sun, Emmett O’Malley, Michael Kramer, Janeen Irving, Alanna Kane\nMusic by Blue Dot Sessions\nFollow us at @intersectionalitymatters, @IMKC_podcast",
