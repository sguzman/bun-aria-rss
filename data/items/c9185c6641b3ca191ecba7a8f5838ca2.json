  "description": "This week on the Colin and Samir Podcast we talk about how media, and specifically social media, plays into defining the identities we all connect with and aspire to be like. We talk about masculinity - which is an interesting topic, because most of our lives and careers have been connected to sports - and sports play a big role in defining masculinity.\nThis has to be one of the most interesting conversations that Coin and I have had to date and i’m curious to hear your opinion once you get to the end of the episode. Our podcast is very conversational and we want to include you in the conversation - so drop us a voice message on anchor or a tweet on twitter at any point in this episode if you have an opinion or thought on the topic we are discussing.",
