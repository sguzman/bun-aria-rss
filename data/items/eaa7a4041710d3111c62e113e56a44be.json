  "description": "When Donald Trump thinks about Kim Jong Un he sees Stormy Daniels.  At least he sees what he saw that night long ago with Ms. Daniels, which is something that he wanted very very much, that he needed to the exclusion of everything else.  He yearns for what Kim and Kim alone can give him.  And that is a taste of historical redemption, something that might change the narrative that even Trump can see is being written about him being the most corrupt and inept president in American history.  Which could lead to the master of the art of the deal getting taken in a negotiation.  Will it happen?  Will the mustachioed man at the president's side allow it?  We discuss this and the other usual mayhem with Rosa Brooks, Ed Luce and Sam Vinograd on this podisode.
