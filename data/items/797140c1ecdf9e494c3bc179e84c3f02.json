  "description": "<p>Kirk Minihane doesn't share his producer's concern that the rapidly spreading coronavirus might put a damper on the Wilbur Theater show. A new parody writer puts a musical touch on Kirk's threat to dox a minor (0:32:37). The crew gets into the presidential race and President Trump's running commentary at a rally last night (1:00:00). But the main attraction today is the fabled city of Kanorado, the new entry into the 46 State Challenge. Controversy erupts during one of the most heated episodes of the Kirk Minihane Show after Kirk and Steve disagree over the viability of a live show in this mysterious community.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
