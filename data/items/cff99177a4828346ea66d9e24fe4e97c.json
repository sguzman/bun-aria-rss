  "description": "This week, the gals turn back the clock and take a peek at some outrageously dumb debacles. Topics include a not-so-sneaky murderess, a brood of naturally delivered bunnies, and whether or not humans really are the most intelligent species after all. Pop open a bottle of Apothic Sparkling Red, buy that rabbit Groupon, and tune in for Beyond Stupid: Historical Crimes.",
