The first step when you're looking for great customer service is to be sure to do business with a reputable company.

Listen as we help you to make the best use of your time when advocating for great customer service.</p><p>During this episode we each enjoyed an Atrial Rubicite by Jester King which you can find on Untappd. A huge thanks to Jerrod at BrainDead Brewing for donating this beer to the show!
