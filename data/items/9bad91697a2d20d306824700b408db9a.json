  "description": "On Tuesday’s Mark Levin show, Why do you think nearly 50 questions that Robert Mueller wants to ask President Trump were leaked to the New York Times? The goal of these leaked questions is that they'll be the bill of particulars for the impeachment of President Donald Trump. None of the questions make serious allegations about Russian collusion and several questions had nothing to do with anything that Mueller was tasked with investigating. Also, Mueller’s upcoming report on his investigation is hugely un-American and hugely unfair to put out a report against somebody who isn’t charged with a crime. But, Mueller doesn’t care that it’s unconstitutional to indict a sitting resident, because a report targeting the president will achieve his objective in damaging the president’s ability to lead the nation. Later, Mueller said that he had another option if Trump declined to talk with federal investigators: he could issue a subpoena for the president to appear before a grand jury. Finally, yesterday, Israel found a massive amount of evidence that Iran has been hiding a nuclear weapons project. But Democrats are saying that this was old news, so they lied to the American people. There’s a growing anti-Israel / anti-Semitism in the Democrat party and in the media; they are in bed with Iran.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
