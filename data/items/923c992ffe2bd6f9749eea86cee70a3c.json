  "description": "In this episode, Sharon sits down with America’s favorite mom, Tabitha Brown. Tabitha talks about how grateful she is that fame and opportunity came at a time in her life when she was ready for it: when she knew what she wanted, and was able to have the patience to do the things that make her feel good, and in turn, make all of us feel good. Together, Sharon and Tabitha talk about Tabitha’s many projects, from her daily TikTok videos, her new restaurant, Kale My Name, her children’s show on YouTube, Tab Time, and even some of her recent collaborations. In everything she does, Tabitha strives to be accessible, make a difference, and give her audience leave to make something their own.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
