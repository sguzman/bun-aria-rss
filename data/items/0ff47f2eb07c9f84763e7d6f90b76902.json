  "description": "We pick up with our special guest Keith Linder about his book 'Bothell Hell House'.\nMy special guest is Keith Linder here to discuss the extraordinary phenomena that he experienced after moving into a rental home with his girlfriend. Get his book The Bothell Hell House: Poltergeist of Washington State on Amazon. His youtube - https://youtu.be/DHp59_Lia3s True Haunted House story - 2012 Keith Linder after successfully obtaining a management position at a prestigious healthcare company decides the time is right for him and his girlfriend to move in together. That's putting things lightly. Weird things begin to happen within days of moving into the modern suburban home. The horrors Keith and his girlfriend witnessed and desperately tried to fight off would end up putting them at odds with members of the paranormal community and themselves. This griping story, told from the house occupant point of view not only lists tales, but also includes pictures, video reenactments, commentary, and audio of the events being reported. Keith Linder does not ask that you believe him. He only asks that you listen. The Bothell Hell House has finally arrived ladies and gentlemen. The house that Zak Bagans and his team came to investigate (albeit for a short time) only to leave empty handed has come full circle. The house occupant tells his story. The complete story which includes why Zak and crew left empty handed. Spontaneous fire outbreaks and inexplicable wall writings are not the most horrific things that happened here. Something more sinister lurks. Robb Tilley of the Australian Institute of Parapsychology Research says \"This case is right up there with the most frightening of poltergeist cases: the Enfield Poltergeist, the South Shields Poltergeist, the Bridgeport Connecticut case, and the Matthew Manning case; all well-researched and detailed in various books and documentaries over the years. The Bothell Hell House is a major work, a turning point in poltergeist research—Well done. \" \n\n\nBECOME A PLUS PASS MEMBER TO ACCESS ARCHIVED EPISODES AND MORE!\n\nAPPLE IPHONE USERS: LISTEN AD-FREE BY BECOMING A PLUS PASS MEMBER ON APPLE PODCASTS\n\nANDROID USERS: LISTEN AD-FREE BY BECOMING A PASS MEMBER AND LISTEN FROM MOST PODCAST APPS\n\nPLUS PASS MEMBER BENEFITS:\nAD-FREE ACCESS TO MYSTERIOUS RADIO PLUS:\nAD-FREE ACCESS TO PARANORMAL FEARS!\nAD-FREE ACCESS TO SEVEN!\nAD-FREE ACCESS TO OVER 150 HOURS OF ARCHIVED EPISODES!\nAD-FREE ACCESS TO CONTROVERSIAL EPISODES!\nAD-FREE ACCESS TO BONUS EPISODES FOR MEMBERS ONLY!\n\nRequest To Join Our Private Community \n\nVisit our home on the web: https://www.mysteriousradio.com\n\nFollow us on Instagram @mysteriousradio\nFollow us on TikTok mysteriousradioTikTok\nFollow us on Twitter @mysteriousradio\nFollow us on Pinterest pinterest.com/mysteriousradio\nLike us on Facebook Facebook.com/mysteriousradio\n\nWant All Paranormal Episodes?
