  "description": "Whether it's mini-makeup kits, gross-smelling slime or semi-automatic foam-dart guns, every parent or caregiver has fielded requests for toys that they're just not that into. We talk about princesses and superheroes and their influence on kids with Rosemarie Truglio of Sesame Workshop and Lisa Dinella, a gender studies professor at Monmouth University. <br/><br/>Here's what to remember: <br/>- Banning toys outright can be counterproductive. <br/>- Pay more attention to <em>how </em>kids play than <em>what </em>they're playing with. <br/>- Fight sexism in the playroom by broadening toy selections. <br/>- Talk directly to your kids about your values.<br/>- Join in your child's play to help expand the possibilities. <br/>- Grossed out? Use toilet toys as a chance to teach science — and manners. ",
