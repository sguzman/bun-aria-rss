  "description": "At the FOURTH Democratic debate, Warren looked like Hillary 2.0, Biden got testy, and the media highlighted “moderates” like Klobuchar and Buttigieg. China is working with Google on a “Manhattan Project” for AI that would make today’s tracking technology look ancient. Comedian Nick Di Paolo gives his unabashed takes on LeBron and Hong Kong, a lack of urinals in Portland, and Project Veritas’ \"shocking\" discovery that CNN is biased. Glenn previews Saturday’s upcoming podcast with Andrii Telizhenko, who saw the DNC influence the 2016 election firsthand. Mike Rowe joins the program to reminisce about famed radio broadcaster Paul Harvey and how his storytelling inspired Rowe's new accidental memoir, “The Way I Heard It.”\nLearn more about your ad choices.
