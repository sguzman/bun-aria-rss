  "description": "<p>Subscribe, Rate, and Leave a Review.\n\nHead over to our youtube to see Feits' new mustachio. We play WWJHD (What Would John Henry Do) if he were put into the Kid Mayor who was shamed out of a protests shoes. We figure out that the hippies were right all along and we should just take their side now so we're not wrong in the future. Feits has a revolutionary solution to make vacations better. Top 5 Tuesday is here with the words that make you sound smarter than you are. Barstool DVR returns. We go over Lost, JK Rowling, Bloodline, High Fidelity, and the upcoming Sammy Sosa/ Mark McGuire Documentary. We also discuss Theo Epstein's wild past times.\nVoicemails today include living on the moon, tinder hookers, and sacrificing for the perfect temperature.\n\nLet us know what you think on twitter.\n\n@kfcradio @KFCBarstool @feitsbarstool\n\nCheck out clips of the podcast on our Youtube Channel.
