  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat remembers his Super Bowl moment as he retells the story of kicking off Super Bowl XLIV in Miami, and how it was the first time in his life that he was legitimately nervous for something. Also included are 4 incredible guests from Radio Row. First, Pro Bowler, member of the 2017 All-Rookie Team, JuJu Smith-Schuster joins the show. He and Pat chat about how difficult this last season was with people taking shots at him for not being healthy and playing too many video games, he shares his reaction to being called out by Antonio Brown, chats about Mike Tomlin, and explains how he gets the frustration out from not getting the ball (12:43-24:20). Next, 2x Super Bowl Champion, current free agent, and friend of the show, Kyle Van Noy joins the boys from Radio Row. He stirs the Tom Brady conspiracy pot and gives a couple landing spots for Tom, chats about being nominated for Walter Payton Man of the Year, explains why he thinks this year was different for the Patriots, and gives his prediction to Super Bowl LIV (26:52-39:03). Next, the greatest CFL Quarterback of all-time, Heisman Trophy winner, 3x Grey Cup Champion, 3x Grey Cup MVP, a man who quarterbacked in three different professional leagues, Doug Flutie joins the show. They chat about his drop kick on what wound up being the last play of his career, what he thinks Tom Brady is going to do next, if its difficult picking up a new system as an again Quarterback, what he did to stay in shape to play into his 40's, and Doug gives his Super Bowl LIV prediction (41:41-53:49). Lastly, Super Bowl Champion, 2x AP NFL Head Coach of the Year, former Carolina Panthers and current Washington Redskins Head Coach, Riverboat Ron Rivera joins the program. They chat about what his expectations are in Washington, and why he ultimately chose them when he could've went almost anywhere, what he's going to do at Quarterback, why he likes their roster, and what they might be thinking about doing with that #2 overall pick (53:51-1:01:58). It's a good one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
