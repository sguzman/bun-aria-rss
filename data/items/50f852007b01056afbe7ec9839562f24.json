  "description": "We’ve been hunkered down at home for more than a year and, for many families, that’s meant finding common ground in viewing habits. \nThis week on What to Watch, Vox film critic Alissa Wilkinson and critic at large Emily VanDerWerff help Stasi, a California mom with two tweens (ages 10 and 12). Stasi says it has been tough to find things to watch as a family — the options are either too juvenile or too mature, and very few hit that sweet spot right in middle. So she wants to know: What should they try?\nEmily recommends:\n\n\nWolfwalkers (Apple TV+): Animated storytelling at its finest. \n\n\nAvatar: The Last Airbender (Netflix): One of the greatest shows ever made. \n\n\nLost (Hulu): Perhaps the most significant show of the 21st century.\n\n\nAlissa recommends:\n\n\nNailed It! (Netflix): A playful reality baking show that celebrates the joy of sugar, friendship, and messing up.\n\n\nI Am Greta (Hulu): An intimate, vulnerable documentary about the teen behind the headlines.\n\n\nThe Water Man (in theaters May 7): It feels like a family film from a bygone era — and that’s what makes it great.\n\n\nLooking for a new show or movie?
