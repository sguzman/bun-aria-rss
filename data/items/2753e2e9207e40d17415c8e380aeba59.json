  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys chat about the Hall of Fame Enshrinement ceremony, and how incredible Peyton Manning, Edgerrin James, Troy Polamalu, and all the different Hall of Fame speeches were, why Peyton Manning could eventually be setting himself up to be the commissioner of the NFL, and how we're inching closer and closer to football season with the Hall of Fame enshrinement now behind us. Joining Pat and AJ Hawk fresh off signing a new 5 year deal with $52 million guaranteed is 3x Pro Bowler, 2x All-Pro, 2018 NFL DROY, The Maniac, Darius Leonard. Pat, AJ, and Darius chat about his new contract, what he thinks about the Colts this year, all the different injuries surrounding the Colts, what he bought with us money, if he gives a damn about his Madden rating, and much more (38:12-55:12). Next, FOX NFL Insider, the man who knows all, Jay Glazer joins Pat and AJ to chat about being at the Hall of Fame, how insane the parties were, spilling red wine on John Lynch's Hall of Fame jacket, his reports on Aaron Rodgers being traded after the season if he's still unhappy, and how he's now on the board at the Hall of Fame on the mental health side (55:14-1:18:52). Later, 2x Olympic Gold Medalist and world record holder in the shot put, Ryan Crouser joins the show to chat about whether or not he ever played football, who kind of explosive lifts he does, if he has anything else to prove in the shot put, what things were like in Tokyo, and how the accommodations in the Olympic Village were (1:20:23-1:37:59). Later, Pat and AJ chat about the charity event that was in AJ's backyard this past weekend for the Hawk Family Foundation, and why The General, Bobby Carpenter, is a weapon of mass destruction (1:39:08-2:03:19).
