  "description": "Today on the show, people in this country don’t seem to understand Christianity. That’s why today there is outrage because a pastor prayed for the president and outrage because a Catholic bishop came out against gay pride parades. Nobody would be shocked by either thing if they had a basic understanding of Christian teaching. Also, Texas bans red light cameras. I'll explain why that is the right decision. Plus I'll answer your emails. Date: 06-04-19\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
