  "description": "<p>Hrishikesh Hirway has been making music for as long as he can remember and, as an adult, spent years building a career in the industry, writing, performing, producing, and touring. But, it was a moment where he took a bit of a pause to re-evaluate that led him to record an interview with a friend about the story and creative decisions behind a song that would change everything. That conversation eventually became the opening episode of the podcast, <a href=\"https://pod.link/songexploder\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Song Exploder</a>, which itself then exploded into a global phenomenon that I’ve been obsessed with since hearing that first episode.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Now, it’s grown into not just an award-winning podcast, but also a <a href=\"https://songexploder.net/netflix\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Netflix</a> original television series where musicians break down the creative process behind their songs, featuring many of the biggest names in music like Alicia Keys, Billie Eilish, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Dua Lipa, The Killers, so many others.
