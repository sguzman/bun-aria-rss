  "description": "<p>On today’s show, the guys get an update from Ty who is in self quarantine right now as he was initially showing some Covid19 symptoms. They also dive into a couple of Digs Debates which involve whether or not they like Chinese buffets, if they are corner brownie/pizza slice fans or prefer it from elsewhere, and discuss what their phone app situations are like. The guys also answer a question from The People of The Pod and try to remember what their favorite national sporting moment from the US has been. It’s a fun one today. Stay safe, and enjoy.</p>\n",
