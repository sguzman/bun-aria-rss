  "description": "<p>Last week you texted your parents to let them know you'd be able to make it home for Christmas this year. They called back to tell you how they decided several years ago to buy a boat. The only problem was that they didn't have the $20,000 to buy it. Their solution? Take out a student loan in your name, of course! Now they've missed several payments and it's about to default, and your father had the nerve to say, \"If you're going to make a big deal about this, it's best if you don't come home this year.\" In shock and 'about' $25,000' in debt, you're wondering if you should sue your parents for identity theft. On this Feedback Friday, we'll do our best to help you figure out not only <em>if</em>, but <em>how</em> to sue your parents for identity theft if you decide it's the right thing to do.</p>\n<p>And in case you didn't already know it, <strong>Jordan Harbinger</strong> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JordanHarbinger\" target=\"_blank\">@JordanHarbinger</a>) and <strong>Jason DeFillippo</strong> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jpdef\" target=\"_blank\">@jpdef</a>) banter and take your comments and questions for Feedback Friday right here every week!
