  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, former Prime Minister Shinzo Abe was assassinated while giving a campaign speech. The killer used a homemade shotgun and was arrested on the spot. A different man is now in custody for threatening the life of U.S Sen. Ted Cruz. In a separate event, Justice Kavanaugh had to sneak out of a restaurant's back door because protesters terrorized him and his family. President Biden knowing all of this attacks the Supreme Court in a speech and says nothing to tamp down the violence. Every last word Biden uttered about abortion and medicine being stuck in the 19th century was false; modern medicine keeps children alive. Later, the teacher's union is attacking the role of parents in every way including changing the terms 'mom' and 'dad' to 'birthing parent' and 'non-birthing parent.' Arizona has implemented a school choice law that covers all students not public school students so that their parents will have equality and choice in K-12 education. Afterward, Elon Musk has terminated the deal to buy Twitter because Twitter has ignored his requests for information on fake accounts. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
