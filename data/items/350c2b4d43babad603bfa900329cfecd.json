Former political organizer & Bonobo Network founder William Winters really connects with Jamie when they speak on a panel called “Liberate your ass: sexual freedom is key in fighting the right” and their brain boners for each other are mutual. Then late one night, Jamie texts; she’s in town but sleeping on a friend’s couch, so feverish with lust, William & Jamie cast caution to the wind while they search for horizontal space to hook up before her flight home.
