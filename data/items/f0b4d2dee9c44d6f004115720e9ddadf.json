  "itunes:summary": "Ross Ramsey of the Texas Tribune sets up Tuesday&#8217;s primaries, the first in the nation.  GOP Gov. Greg Abbott is all but assured of renomination, and will likely face Democrat Beto O&#8217;Rourke in November.  But the main battle on March 1st is the Republican primary for state attorney general.  Incumbent Ken Paxton is facing three challengers: former state Supreme Court Justice Eva Guzman, Congressman Louie Gohmert, and George P. Bush, the state Land Commissioner, who is betting his political future on this race.<br />\nAnd with Presidents Day just behind us, we&#8217;re replaying a favorite segment from 2015, with author and playwright Murray Horwitz focusing on movies that feature our presidents, everything from the somber &#8220;Seven Days in May&#8221; to the anarchial &#8220;Duck Soup.&#8221;<br />\nMusic heard in this episode:<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLi0gguAO9o\">A Whiter Shade of Pale by Procol Harum</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=zLi0gguAO9o\">Let&#8217;s Talk About Me by the Alan Parsons Project</a><br />\n<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iDSFQzyfcHU\">In Held &#8216;Twas In I by Procol Harum</a><br />",
