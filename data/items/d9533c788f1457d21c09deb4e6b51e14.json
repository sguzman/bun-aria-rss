  "title": "Working at the White House: Director of Presidential Correspondence, Fiona Reeves",
  "description": "There's no workplace that looms larger in Washington, D.C. than the White House. Hundreds of employees work within its walls, but most of us don't know much about what really goes on there. In a special season of Working, we're peeking behind that curtain talking to some of those who make their way through the White House's gates each morning.\nFor our first episode, we're talking to Fiona Reeves, the Director of Presidential Correspondence. Every day Reeves and her staff sort through thousands of letters and emails that the President receives from his constituents. She ultimately selects ten for him to read each night. She talked to us about some of the most memorable letters she's examined, from the sad, to the funny, to the hopeful. \nAnd in a Slate Plus extra, Reeves tells us how social media and email have informed the art of letter writing.
