  "description": "<p>This is a definite left turn for the show, but something I needed to do. My grandfather, Roy Payne passed away last week. I've been entrenched in emotion, cleaning out his house and processing the loss. I had an interview I conducted with him back in 2011 about his 95 years on this planet and regardless of the lack of personal connection you may have with him, his story is universal. People of \"the greatest generation\" have stories that will blow your minds and I didn't want this to be something only my family shared. Please enjoy and as a \"bonus\" you can hear my son and I be goofy at the end of the podcast. Thanks for your well wishes and next week, we will be back to our regularly scheduled program.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
