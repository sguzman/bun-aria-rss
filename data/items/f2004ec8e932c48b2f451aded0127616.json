  "description": "On Halloween day in 2005, a 25-year-old photographer headed to a Wisconsin Salvage Yard and was never seen again. When her car was found a few days later on the same property, a man was arrested for her murder. But did he do it? With theories of the man being framed and other persons of interests sneaking into the story, many are left wondering if police have the right man behind bars. This is the story of Teresa Halbach. \n\nBONUS EPISODES\npatreon.com/goingwestpodcast\nCASE SOURCES\n1.
