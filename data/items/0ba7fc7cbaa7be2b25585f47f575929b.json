A soap box for Independent Ideas, current events and politics of the day. \nThe 47% moment. Modern Politics is filled with gaffs, trips and falls from the politicians. It is also covered by the 4 hour news cycle, so when one candidate insults nearly 1/2 of the supporters of the other, don't be surprised to learn that life can take a dramatic turn for the worse. Stand up Deplorables, and make your Country Proud. \nPodcast: Galtspeaks.com Contact: Radio@galtspeaks.com Follow us on twitter.com/radiomarkowitz & Facebook.com/radiomarkowitz Spreaker-www.spreaker.com/show/the-warren-markowitz-show & our new home on Redstatetalkradio.com Support the podcast, use the next level of autonomy, cryptocurrency: BTC: Azen7A8rsEwQ84SCB3ZsbuYALpNCGgqNc",
