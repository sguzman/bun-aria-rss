  "description": "<p>Robert Hansen owned and operated a successful bakery in Anchorage, Alaska in the 1970s and 80s, selling donuts and danishes to everyone in town. He was a well-known and well-respected member of the business community, living in a nice home in the suburbs with his wife and two children. In his spare time, he liked to fly his plane to the remote area around the Knik River and hunt for wolves and caribou and other large game. But sometimes the wild animals just weren’t enough. He needed something else to hunt, to chase along the river flats, to stalk and kill. </p><p><br />For current Fan Club membership options and policies, please visit <a href=\"https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/\">https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/</a>. </p><p>Sources for this episode cannot be listed here due to character limitations.
