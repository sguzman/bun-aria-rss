We will show you how our software, based on Method-of-Moments, can analyze several scenarios including complicated and electrically large models (for instance, antenna placement and RCS) using desktop workstations.<u></u><u></u></p><p><a href=\"https://wipl-d.com/electrically-large-scenarios/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Download this free whitepaper now!</a></p>",
