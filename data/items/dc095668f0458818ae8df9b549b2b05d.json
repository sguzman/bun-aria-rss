  "description": "<p>This week Las Culturistas invites a queer latinx stoner podcaster and it's NOT even Che Diaz!!! It's the much less annoying Fran Tirado! And would you believe that Che takes up a lot of discussion space in this episode of all episodes? The gals discuss just WHAT Che is representing, And Just Like That as we barrell towards the finale, white creators confronting whiteness in their work, Spider Man: No Way Home and fan service culture, how Peacock is actually IT, Real Housewives: Ultimate Girls Trip, casting queer roles with straight actors and the backlash that occurs when it happens, Drag Race and the Maddy Morphosis of it all, Greek mythology, youth group, how D.A.R.E. made us want to do drugs more, and that thing that happens when you masturbate too much and your dick goes \"poof!\" like a baby dragon who can't yet breathe fire. Would you introduce yourself to your favorite OnlyFans creator if you saw them at the mall? Can you handle if it Jujubee loses another season of Drag Race? Should Raya end once and for all? Much to discuss! Listen to this AND Fran's new podcast Like A Virgin with Las Cultch favorite Rose Dommu!</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
