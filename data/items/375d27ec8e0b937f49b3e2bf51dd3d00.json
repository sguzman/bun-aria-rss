So, things have been a bit busy over here. So while we put the finishing touches on next week’s episode, I’m re-airing one of my old favorites from the first season of the podcast. And guess what? It’ll prepare you nicely for the next season. Wink wink. Today, I’m returning to share the story of Sofonisba Anguissola, one of the most prominent female artists of the Italian Renaissance. I hope you enjoy--and back to you next week.
