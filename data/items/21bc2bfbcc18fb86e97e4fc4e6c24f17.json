For instance you know who to call if you need a plumber recommendation, or you know which friend has the best beach recommendations on the gulf- well Leanne Brown is our go-to person when it comes to eating really well, but for less. Leanne is our ‘friend in the kitchen’ and her New York Times bestseller “Good and Cheap” is now free and has been downloaded millions of times. And now her new cookbook “Good Enough” was just published last week- it’s a mix of essays, personal stories, and delicious recipes as she <em>also</em> acknowledges the fear and anxiety many have when it comes to cooking. She explains how eating great isn’t about expensive gadgets or ingredients, how we all need some low-effort meals in our repertoire, picky eaters, meal delivery services, and more!</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a BA Stout by Easy Chair Brewing Garage- a big thanks to Jess for donating this delicious craft beer to the podcast!
