  "title": "Mark Levin Audio Rewind - 6/24/19",
  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, more millennials would rather live under socialism than capitalism due to historical illiteracy. Not knowing or not caring about the gulags of the Soviet Union that vanished people and their lives. Today our media uses similar strong-arm tactics to erase careers since they don't imprison like government can. Sadly, American-liberals have embraced elements of Stalinism. As a result, people now blame America instead of blaming our nation's enemies. They are devouring our institutions and the Democratic Party is the bulwark for the radical left in our institutions like the media. The modern mass media is no longer a check on big government, they are not about freedom, and they are not about speech! A mouthpiece for progressivism just like the NYT was the mouthpiece for Stalin. Also, Chuck Todd was rude and abrupt in his interview with President Trump Sunday and wouldn’t even let him finish his answer. Then, Jack Hunter maligns Mark Levin and Ben Shapiro inaccurately saying that they were irritated that Trump didn't bomb Iran. After, investigative filmmaker James O'Keefe calls in to discuss his latest release regarding a whistleblower from Google on their intentions to censor Trump and influence the 2020 election. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
