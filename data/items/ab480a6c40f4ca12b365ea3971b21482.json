  "description": "<p>Colson Whitehead’s new novel, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/14/books/review/colson-whitehead-harlem-shuffle.html\" target=\"_blank\">“Harlem Shuffle,”</a> revolves around Ray Carney, a furniture retailer in Harlem in the 1960s with a sideline in crime. It’s a relatively lighthearted novel, certainly compared to “The Underground Railroad” and “The Nickel Boys,” Whitehead’s two previous novels, each of which won the Pulitzer Prize.</p><p>“I usually do a lighter book, then a heavier book, but I felt compelled to write ‘The Nickel Boys’ at the time that I did,” Whitehead says on this week’s podcast. “I knew that in the crime genre, there’s more room for jokes. There’s just a lot more room for play. So I could exercise my humor muscle again. And then immediately, Carney … I wanted him to win, as soon as he appeared on the page. He was someone who was not as determined by circumstances — slavery, Jim Crow — as the characters in those previous two novels. And he pulls off some capers. And I think we — or at least I was rooting for him. So immediately the tone was different, and I gave myself to it.”</p><p>Colm Toibin visits the podcast to talk about his new novel, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/09/07/books/review/colm-toibin-magician.html\" target=\"_blank\">“The Magician,”</a> based on the life of the great German writer Thomas Mann. Toibin says that the book is not an attempt to “inhabit” Mann, or to fully understand him, which is impossible with such a complex person.</p><p>“It’s not an attempt to pin him down, so that by the end of the book you really know him,” Toibin says. “I’m as interested in his unknowability as I am in attempting to draw a very clear portrait of him. I think it’s an important question. I often hear novelists saying, ‘I felt I really knew my character.’ And I often feel the opposite. I often feel my character has become even more evasive the further attempts I have made to enter their spirit.”</p><p>Also on this week’s episode, Tina Jordan looks back at Book Review history as it celebrates its 125th anniversary; Alexandra Alter has news from the publishing world; and Gregory Cowles and John Williams talk about what they’ve been reading. Pamela Paul is the host.</p><p>Here are the books discussed in this week’s “What We’re Reading”:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nyrb.com/products/a-time-of-gifts?variant=1094928933\" target=\"_blank\">“A Time of Gifts”</a> by Patrick Leigh Fermor</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/1989/02/24/books/books-of-the-times-brookner-s-outsiders-as-opposites-who-attract.html\" target=\"_blank\">“Latecomers”</a> by Anita Brookner</p><p><a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/176421/the-makioka-sisters-by-junichiro-tanizaki/\" target=\"_blank\">“The Makioka Sisters”</a> by Junichiro Tanizaki</p>\n",
