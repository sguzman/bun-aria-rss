  "description": "Things that I don’t tolerate and you shouldn’t either: cheaters, selfish lovers, and fake orgasms. Don’t fake orgasms! Don’t try to put on a sexy face and give a porn star moan when you don’t mean it. Instead of faking orgasms, find out how you can really enjoy sex. It helps if you have a tall, dark, and handsome companion, but you need to do the work on yourself to find out what feels good. Show him what you like, instead of putting on a show to satisfy his ego.How do you know if your boyfriend is cheating? If you have to ask whether your boyfriend is a cheater or not, then he’s probably a cheater. I’ll show you how to know whether he’s a cheater or not, without going through his cell phone in the middle of the night.How much should you talk about sex on a date? As a sex expert, I probably talk about sex more than the average person. I can’t help bring up sex when I’m out on a date, but should you talk about sex on the first date? Also, what do you do about a selfish lover? If he’s not going down on you, what is the best plan of attack? Withhold oral sex from him? Steal his video game controls? Or maybe you should just communicate with your partner that you want oral sex?<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
