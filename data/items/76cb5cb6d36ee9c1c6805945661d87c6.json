  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, Nancy Pelosi has completed her plan, landed in Taiwan, and has more testosterone than Biden, Austin, MIlley, and the radical libertarian isolationists. Then, radical leftwing Lt Governor of Pennsylvania John Fetterman is avoiding debates with Dr Oz due to a stroke and the public isn't aware of how radical his agenda is. Liz Cheney, and Mitt Romney stabbed conservatives in the back. Dr. Oz is no Romney. Oz is conservative on many issues even if he's not as conservative as any of us, he's not a leftwing Marxist nutjob like his opponent. Afterward, Rep. Liz Cheney took to Twitter to criticize this program's defense of the Constitution and explanation of how a candidate can legally challenge an election's outcome without violating any laws. Cheney is wrong, lobbying for a state legislature to present alternate electors is not a crime, it's part of the political process. and she has been invited to discuss this on the air and has ignored all invitations this far. Finally, Col. Kurt Schlichter joins the show to discuss his new book \"We'll be back: The Fall and Rise of America.\"  https://www.amazon.com/Well-Be-Back-Fall-America/dp/1684513308/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=kurt+schlichter&qid=1659129687&sprefix=kurt+sc%2Caps%2C134&sr=8-1\nLearn more about your ad choices.
