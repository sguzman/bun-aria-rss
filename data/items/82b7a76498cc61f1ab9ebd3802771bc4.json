  "title": "239: How to Go Easy on Yourself in a Pandemic | Dr. Kristin Neff",
  "description": "It's easy to add insult to injury in this pandemic by beating ourselves up. Why are we not exercising more? Eating less? Or boosting our productivity? Kristin Neff, an associate professor at the University of Texas at Austin, says we need to give ourselves a break. To be clear, that does not mean relinquishing our high standards. Neff is one of - if not the - world’s leading experts on self-compassion. That's a squishy-sounding term, but there is a lot of hard-nosed evidence behind it. Per Neff, not beating yourself up does not equate to being lazy. It's about knowing the difference between healthy perfectionism and maladaptive perfectionism. It's about going easy without going soft. The smart, sparing use of the inner cattle prod. This was exactly the conversation I needed to have right now.\nWhere to find Kristin Neff online:\nWebsite: https://self-compassion.org/\nSocial Media:\nTwitter: @self_compassion / https://twitter.com/self_compassion\nFacebook: Self-Compassion by Kristin Neff, Ph.D. / https://www.facebook.com/selfcompassion\nOther Resources Mentioned:\nRichard Schwartz, Internal Family Systems / https://ifs-institute.com/\nEvelyn Tribole, Intuitive Eating / https://www.evelyntribole.com/\nChris Germer / https://chrisgermer.com/\nAdditional Resources:\nTen Percent Happier Live: https://tenpercent.com/live\nCoronavirus Sanity Guide: https://www.tenpercent.com/coronavirussanityguide\nFree App access for Health Care Workers: https://tenpercent.com/care\nFull shownotes: https://www.tenpercent.com/podcast-episode/kristin-neff-239\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
