  "description": "<p>On this episode, we’re exploring the potential of the circular economy. First, we hear from Kenyan entrepreneur Nzambi Matee about how she’s tackling the plastic waste problem in Nairobi through Gjenge Makers, her company that creates alternative building products out of the typically disposed of material. Nzambi speaks to the potential for innovative solutions such as affordable housing that come from reframing how we view the waste that we create. Then, host Carla Harris sits down with Garry Cooper, the founder of Rheaply, a platform that connects businesses and organizations to each other to help circulate everything from desktops or chairs to heavy machinery, rather than sending them to the landfill. Garry discusses what he sees as a $630 billion market for unused and underused things.&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.morganstanley.com/what-we-do/inclusive-innovation-and-opportunity\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.morganstanley.com/what-we-do/inclusive-innovation-and-opportunity</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Disclaimer text</em></p><p><em>The guest speakers are neither employees nor affiliated with Morgan Stanley & Co.
