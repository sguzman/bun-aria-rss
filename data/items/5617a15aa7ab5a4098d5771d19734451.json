  "description": "On Friday’s Mark Levin Show, Larry O’Connor of WMAL fills in for Mark. If nothing major happens to President Trump between now and election day in November, will Republicans keep the majority in the House and Senate? Or has the media created enough doubt and hatred of Republicans by pushing fake outrage and phony stories to give Democrats the majority and move toward impeachment? The big story today was an anonymous Congressman telling the media that Bruce Ohr told them that Michael Steele told him that anonymous Russian told him that they had dirt on Trump – another phony collusion story. Also, when Conservative principles and arguments are held up to logic, they win every time because they’re based on facts and universal truths. It why proponents of liberal ideas always try to redefine what universal truths are. The fact that they’re trying to redefine gender tells you it’s part of what the left does – always trying to rig the game, or have the government rig it for them. Later, with kids going back to school the school shooting issue is making its way back into the news, and the leftist media is already pushing their agenda. School shootings are terrible, but exaggerating the issue to advance an ideology is worse.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
