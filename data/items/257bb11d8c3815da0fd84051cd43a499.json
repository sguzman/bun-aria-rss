  "description": "<p>Joe Trohman is best known as the guitarist in the multi-platinum rock act Fall Out Boy but he's also created cartoons, comics and the upcoming memoir, None of This Rocks. We sat down with Joe to discuss his earliest movie memories, which include his mother showing him the Omen and share our own inappropriate movie memories, which include their parents' friend Terry showing us The Re-Animator when we were way too young. Along the way we also discuss Joe's lifelong obsession with horror movies, the fact that he and Vanessa shared the same therapist in New York City and Joe's memorable episode of MTV's Cribs. We also recall the time Jonah visited the New York Stock Exchange with Fall Out Boy and Joe's infinite metal cred (he's in a band with Anthrax's Scott Ian after all). Finally, we answer the age-old question: Can Domino's do deep-dish pizza? You'll have to listen to find out.&nbsp;</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
