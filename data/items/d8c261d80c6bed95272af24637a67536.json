  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, big cities, big corporations, and Hollywood are controlled mostly by the Democrats. If there is systemic racism in America it’s at this level where the Democrats have all the control. Then, the biggest fraud of them all is wealthy left-wing individuals both white and black. These hypocrites don't even live in the very communities that they claim to care so much about. Why not? Is it because they are racist? No! It’s because these neighborhoods are crime-infested and have failing schools. Athletes want to live in gated communities and wear social statements on their uniforms, which is a right that comes from the very Constitution that protects their right to protest. Afterward, renowned Economist, Dr. Thomas Sowell, joins the show to discuss his new book “Charter Schools and Their Enemies.” Sowell highlights the roadblocks preventing low-income minority students from accessing educational equality. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
