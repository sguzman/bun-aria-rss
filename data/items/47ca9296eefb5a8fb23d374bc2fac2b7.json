  "title": "#132: The History of the American Bachelor with Howard Chudacoff",
  "description": "<p>Something all men have in common is that one point in their lives they're all bachelors, that is, they've never been married. What's interesting is that there's been very little written about the history and sociology of bachelorhood. Well, my guest today is the author of one of the few books on the topic. His name is Howard Chudacoff and he's the author of the book, The Age of the Bacehlor. Dr. Chudacoff and I discuss the influence bachelors in America have had on American masculinity, particularly the bachelors who lived during the late 19th century or \"Golden Age of Bachelorhood.\" It was during this time that bars, barbershops, and pool halls became masculine institutions and the traditionally male past times like sports rose in prominence in the U.S.</p>\n",
