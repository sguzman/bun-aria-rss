  "description": "<p>\n    While the most common accelerated methods like Polyak and Nesterov incorporate a momentum term, a little known fact is that simple gradient descent &ndash;no momentum&ndash; can achieve the same rate  \n    through only a well-chosen sequence of step-sizes. In this post we'll derive this method and through simulations discuss its practical â€¦</p>",
