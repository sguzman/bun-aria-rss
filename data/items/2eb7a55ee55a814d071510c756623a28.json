  "description": "<p>This paper proposes a novel method to estimate individualised treatment\nassignment rules. The method is designed to find rules that are stochastic,\nreflecting uncertainty in estimation of an assignment rule and about its\nwelfare performance. Our approach is to form a prior distribution over\nassignment rules and to update this prior based upon an empirical welfare\ncriterion. The social planner then assigns treatment by drawing a policy from\nthe resulting posterior. We show analytically a welfare-optimal way of updating\nthe prior using empirical welfare. The posterior obtained by implementing the\noptimal updating rule is not feasible to compute, so we propose a variational\nBayes approximation for the optimal posterior. We characterise the welfare\nregret convergence of the assignment rule based upon this variational Bayes\napproximation and show that it converges to zero at a rate of ln(n)/sqrt(n). We\napply our methods to experimental data from the Job Training Partnership Act\nStudy and extensive numerical simulations to illustrate the implementation of\nour methods.\n</p>",
