They also discuss a comment that the same psychologist made to Drew about how many women are coming to his practice and lamenting that they miss 'men being men'. Adam also discusses 'pattern breaks' and how it helped Adam cut through the Covid hysteria much much faster than the general populace. \n\nPlease Support Our Sponsors:\nRocketMoney.com/ADS\nFastGrowingTrees.com/ADS\nJimmyJane.com promo code Adam&Drew25",
