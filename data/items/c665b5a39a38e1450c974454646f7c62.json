  "description": "It’s been more than a decade since the European Organization for Nuclear Research (known as CERN) discovered the Higgs Boson, using their gigantic particle accelerator, the Large Hadron Collider. After three years of upgrades, they’re turning the world’s largest machine back on. What secrets of the universe are they hoping to discover? Will there be another “God Particle” moment? And are these expensive, high-energy colliders the best way forward in physics?\n\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
