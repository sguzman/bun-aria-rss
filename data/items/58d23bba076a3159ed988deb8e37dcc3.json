  "description": "<p>Welcome to the first episode in our series on Greek drama and <em>The Trojan Women</em> by Euripides. Classicist Thomas Banks will be leading the discussion with Angelina Stanford and Cindy Rollins asking questions and adding their own thoughts along the way. If you enjoy these podcasts, you can also check out the <a href= \"https://houseofhumaneletters.com/classes/\">HouseofHumaneLetters.com</a> for the summer intensive on Classical Greek Drama.</p> <p>Thomas begins with some background on the development on Greek drama in history. He also explains the role of the chorus in typical Greek plays in contrast to how Euripides uses it in this play. He then gives us a little biographical information on Euripides and places him, along with the other Greek dramatists, in the context of history. He also talks about the questions of theodicy that come up in The Trojan Women and other of Euripides’ works. Thomas points out some resources to give readers background on Greek mythology and characters you will see in these plays. He continues with a brief overview of the Trojan War. Our host wrap up with some thoughts on the prologue of <em>The Trojan Women</em>.</p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>This the story of my life, that while I lived it weighed upon me and pressed against me and filled all my senses to overflowing and now is like a dream dreamed…..This is my story, my giving of thanks.</p> <cite>Wendell Berry</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>Sophocles is wise, Euripedes is wiser, but Socrates is wisest of them all.</p> <cite>The Oracle of Delphi</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>The past is a foreign country: they do things differently there.</p> <cite>L.
