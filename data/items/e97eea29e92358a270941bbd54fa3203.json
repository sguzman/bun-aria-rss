But Fidel Castro’s comrades from the 26th of July movement had other plans. How did Juan Manuel Fangio go from his modest upbringing to become one of the most famous sports figures in the world? What makes his career in Formula One so special? And why on earth was he thrust into the middle of Cuba’s volatile political crises?!
