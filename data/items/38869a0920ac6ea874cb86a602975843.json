  "description": "In Netflix's <em>The Adam Project</em>, Ryan Reynolds is a pilot from the future who goes back in time to the present day, where he enlists the aid of his 12-year-old self (Walker Scobell) to save the timeline. Toss in small roles for Jennifer Garner and Mark Ruffalo as Adam's parents, and you've got yourself a <em>13 Going on 30 </em>mini-reunion. This is Reynolds' second team-up with director Shawn Levy, who directed last year's <em>Free Guy. </em>",
