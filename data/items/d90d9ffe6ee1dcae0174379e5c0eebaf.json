  "description": "<p>In this 137th in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens.</p><p>This week, we discuss Diversity, Equity, and Inclusion (DEI) in the academy, and ask: does DEI belong in science? If the answer is no, are we contributing to a hostile or alienating workplace? We argue that it is the DEI enthusiasts who are creating hostile and alienating spaces for all of the rest of us. Then: laboratory of the self, and some hypotheses about pain perception, illness, and pathogens. Finally: land sharks.
