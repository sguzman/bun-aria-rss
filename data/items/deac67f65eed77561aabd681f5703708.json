  "description": "The second annual edition of the Fullcast's open call for your worst backyard catastrophes did not disappoint, as our listeners spent their summers setting hornet's nests on fire, watching their fathers drive lawnmowers into bodies of water, burning evergreen trees and discovering why they are called \"nature's portable dynamite,\" taking children to the emergency room after horrific family football games, and knocking out the power to whole swaths of their hometowns by throwing used sports gear at vulnerable pieces of public infrastructure. You are all very stupid, and we are so happy about it right now.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices\n      \nLearn more about your ad choices.
