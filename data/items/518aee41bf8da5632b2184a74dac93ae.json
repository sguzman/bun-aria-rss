In this thesis my goal is to provide an overview of this endeavor and advance it by developing new software as well as quantitative methods. To demonstrate their use- fulness I will apply these methods to real-world data sets. A central theme will be the bridging of multiple levels of analysis of the brain ranging from neuroscience and cognition to behavior. In chapter 1 I describe the current crisis in research and treat- ment of mental illness and argue that computational psychiatry provides the tools to solve some long-standing issues that hindered progress in this area. I describe these tools by reviewing the current literature on computational psychiatry and demon- strate their usefulness on two real-world data sets. To provide a coherent scope, I will focus on response inhibition as it provides a rich literature in each of the di↵erent levels of analysis with clear links to psychopathology. In chapter 2 I first establish a neuronal basis by presenting a biologically plausible neural network model of key areas involved in response inhibition. Capturing the high-level computations of this fairly complex model requires more abstract cognitive process models. Towards this goal we developed software (chapter 3) to estimate a decision making model in a hier- archical Bayesian manner which improves parameter recovery in a simulation study. In chapter 4 I then bridge the neuronal and cognitive level by fitting a psychological process model to the simulated behavioral output of the neural network model under certain biological manipulations. By analyzing which biological manipulation is best captured by changes in certain high-level computational parameters I start to link both levels of analysis. I then apply this same psychological process model to two data sets from selective response inhibition tasks administered to patients su↵ering from Huntington’s disease (chapter 5) and depression (chapter 6). Having identified neurobiological correlates of certain model parameters allows to then formulate the- ories not only about cognitive processes impacted by these disorders but also which neuronal mechanism are likely to be involved. In addition, I demonstrate that the description of subjects’ performance by computational model parameters can lead to better classification accuracy of disease state when compared to traditionally used summary statistics.\"</p>",
