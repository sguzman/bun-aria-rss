Even just thinking about a negative experience can set off a cascade of physiological events in the body just as if it’s happening right now—the mind-body connection is truly that powerful.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In today’s episode, I talk with Dr. Joe Dispenza, Emily Fletcher, and Dr. Leonard Calabrese about why our thoughts influence our physiology and what we can do to improve our health, even when we feel we are stuck. Once we are aware of our thoughts and learn to retrain our brains, using such techniques as meditation to break the conditioning process, we see substantial changes in health.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Joe Dispenza’s passion can be found at the intersection of the latest findings from the fields of neuroscience, epigenetics, and quantum physics, where he explores the science behind spontaneous remissions. He uses that knowledge to teach people how to heal their bodies of health conditions, make significant changes in their lives, and evolve their consciousness. Since 2010, he has partnered with scientists and universities to perform extensive research on the effects that meditation has on the brain and body. He and his team have also studied gene expression, protein regulation, immune response, neurotransmitter changes, telomere length, and variations in bioactive cellular metabolic particles in novice and advanced meditators.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Emily Fletcher is the founder of Ziva, the creator of the Ziva Technique, and regarded as a leading expert in meditation for high performers. She is also the author of <em>Stress Less, Accomplish More: Meditation for Extraordinary Performance</em>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Leonard Calabrese is a professor of medicine at the Cleveland Clinic Lerner College of Medicine of Case Western Reserve University and vice chair of the Department of Rheumatic and Immunologic Diseases.
