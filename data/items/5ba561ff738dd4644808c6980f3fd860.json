  "description": "<p>Scott Soshnick and Eben Novy-Williams discuss a host of issues related to the business of sports, including the PGA Tour’s new media rights deals with NBC, CBS and ESPN, which will show events on its streaming service, ESPN+. Network coverage remains with CBS and NBC. The nine-year deal begins in 2022, and will pay the Tour about $7 billion, a hefty rights increase from its current agreement. Also talked about is the continuing effect of the coronavirus on sports. Most recently, the tennis tournament in Indian Wells, California, one of the sport’s biggest events outside of the four majors, was canceled because of the outbreak. Qualifying matches were scheduled to begin today. And also discussed is Atlanta Hawks Chief Executive Officer Steve Koonin’s suggestion that the league begin its season in December, two months later than it currently does. That way, Koonin said, the NBA wouldn’t compete for attention with the NFL.</p><p><br></p><p>Hosts: Scott Soshnick, Eben Novy-Williams and Michael Barr</p><p>Producer: Tim Herro</p><p><br></p><p>To contact the reporters on this story:</p><p>Scott Soshnick in New York at <a href=\"mailto:ssoshnick@bloomberg.net\">ssoshnick@bloomberg.net</a>;</p><p>Eben Novy-Williams in New York at <a href=\"mailto:enovywilliam@bloomberg.net\">enovywilliam@bloomberg.net</a>;</p><p>Michael Barr in New York at <a href=\"mailto:mbarr18@bloomberg.net\">mbarr18@bloomberg.net</a></p><p><br></p><p>To contact the editor responsible for this story:</p><p>Scott Soshnick at <a href=\"mailto:ssoshnick@bloomberg.net\">ssoshnick@bloomberg.net</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
