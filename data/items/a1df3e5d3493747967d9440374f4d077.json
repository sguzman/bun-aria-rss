  "description": "<p>LOOK OUT! It’s only Films To Be Buried With! Join your host Brett Goldstein as he talks life, death, love and the universe with the multi-disciplined writer and magician NICK MOHAMMED!</p><br><p>It truly is a difficult time for us all right now, and by ‘us all’ I mean the world as a whole. This doesn’t need to be said I know but it would feel weird to not talk about it at all. Podcasts are in a very interesting situation as a result, where at this point after isolation it almost feels weird that people used to sit and face each other talking. Doesn’t that seem strange? Anyway, this one was recorded before we were all put on lockdown or self isolating, and so it might be a satisfying and distracting vibe for you this week - a very welcome and friendly session with Brett and Nick as they go in on - well, room service for one - but for the most part, ‘Intelligence’ - the new series created by Nick and featuring Ross from Friends! Sorry, David Schwimmer. As well as that, there’s a lot of really fun and interesting chat happening, so please do set some time aside and enjoy yourself. And as always - be excellent to each other okay? Distant or not. Let’s all be excellent.
