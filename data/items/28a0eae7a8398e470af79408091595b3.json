  "description": "Glenn hosts live from Plymouth, Massachusetts, at the “Plot #1” house where the first Thanksgiving is believed to have taken place. Nancy Pelosi is on the attack, claiming that Trump withheld money from Ukraine to benefit Putin and that this action made Nixon look “almost small.” Glenn and Pat discuss “Ford vs. Ferrari,” which may be the perfect father and son movie. Pastor Paul Jehle joins Glenn to tell the real story of the Pilgrims and Thanksgiving, the religious reason they came here, and the importance of family through it all. Our nation must remember that we are Plymouth, not Jamestown, and that we are a covenant nation. Beth Perara of the Leyden Preservation Group joins to discuss what it means to be a pilgrim.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
