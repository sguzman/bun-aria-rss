  "description": "Coming at you live from…well, the house they live in together! Sofia is joined by her brother, our very own, Lucas Franklyn! Who very recently turned 18 so watch out ladies! Together the two dive DEEP into their family dynamics which seem to be nothing short of a Meet The Fockers movie. Lucas then takes us into the Gen Z world of dating, Snapchat, and how he lied to his parents about losing his virginity…but not in the way you think. Finally, we hear QUITE the story about how a certain Sloot made her way to Lucas’ Snapchat and it didn’t go exactly how she planned. He gives some good insight on how one of you Sloot’s can become the lucky girl though. There’s no better way to kick off the holidays than with your little brother right?\nFollow Sofia on Instagram and Twitter @SofiaFranklyn\nFind merch HERE: https://sofiafranklyn.com/ \nEpisode promo codes:\nZola: http://Zola.com/SOFIA and use promo code SAVE50 for fifty percent off your save the dates\nBean Box : http://beanbox.com/SOFIA15 for 15% off purchases $40 or more \nHello Fresh: http://hellofresh.com/SOFIA14 and use code SOFIA14 for up to 14 free meals AND 3 free gifts\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
