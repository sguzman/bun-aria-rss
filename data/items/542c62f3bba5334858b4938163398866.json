  "description": "It's another jam packed Bourbon Community Roundtable as we discuss the latest trending topics of the past few weeks. One of the greatest pieces of whiskey news is that tariffs are being eliminated.

Lastly, the market is the market and we all know that stores are beginning to price their prized bottles close to secondary.
