  "description": "<p>Every cemetery is as unique as the people who are buried within. Tombstones stand in silent vigil over final resting places. Some markers are made from stone, others from simple wood. Many are professionally etched, but a handful are lovingly hand carved. All are a testament to a life lived, some well and some not so well. All with value. On this episode, we feature cemeteries in the Middle East, South Carolina, Ohio, Michigan, Illinois and Canada. Join us for Haunted Cemeteries 24! The Moment in Oddity features the Curse of the Uluru Rocks and This Month in History features Johnny Carson becoming host of the Tonight Show.</p> <p>Our sponsor this episode is Libsyn.
