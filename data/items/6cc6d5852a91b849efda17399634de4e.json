  "description": "As panelist Kori Schake recounts, former Treasury Secretary Larry Summers once noted that if you staff an administration exclusively with \"C\" people you will get a \"D\" staff.  He never contemplated the situation we find ourselves in today.  As we in the Third Sub-basement of the Ministry of Snark contemplate the Flynn plea deal, the statements of Trump's lawyers, the foreign policy pronouncements of Jared Kushner and more events of the past week, we yearn for the days of \"D\" staff.  Rosa Brooks of Georgetown, Kori Schake of Stanford and David Sanger of the New York Times join for a cold hard look at some stone cold losers.
