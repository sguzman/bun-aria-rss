  "description": "The Almanac of American Politics described Daniel Patrick Moynihan as “The nation’s best thinker among politicians since Lincoln and its best politician among thinkers since Jefferson.” Before his election to the US Senate in 1976, Moynihan served in the administrations of Presidents Kennedy, Johnson, Nixon and Ford. He was ambassador to India, and U.S. representative to the United Nations, and was four times elected to the U.S. Senate from New York.\nThis week we are honored to add Daniel Patrick Moynihan: A Portrait in Letters of an AmericanVisionary to the Words Matter Audible Library. In this important book, distinguished journalist Steven Weisman compiles a vivid portrait of Moynihan’s life, in the senator’s own words. Moynihan's letters offer an extraordinary window into particular moments in history, from his feelings of loss at JFK’s assassination, to his passionate pleas to Nixon not to make Vietnam a Nixon war, to his frustrations over healthcare and welfare reform during the Clinton era.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/words-matter.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
