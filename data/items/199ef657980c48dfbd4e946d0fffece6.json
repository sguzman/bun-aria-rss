  "description": "In movies, asteroids careening towards Earth are confronted by determined humans with nuclear weapons to save the world! But a real NASA mission wants to change the course of an asteroid now (one not hurtling towards Earth). The <a href=\"https://www.nasa.gov/planetarydefense/dart/dart-news\">Double Asteroid Redirection Test</a>, or DART, launched in 2021 and on Monday, September 26, 2022, makes contact with the celestial object. In 2021, NPR science correspondent <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/people/4494969/nell-greenfieldboyce\">Nell Greenfieldboyce</a> talked about what it takes to pull off this mission and how it could potentially protect the Earth in the future from killer space rocks, and that's what you'll hear today. And stay tuned - when NASA has the results of contact in a few weeks, Short Wave will bring Nell back to tell us all about it!",
