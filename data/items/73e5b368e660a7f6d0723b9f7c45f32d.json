  "description": "On today's show, Pat and the boys do a DEEP dive into everything that happened this week in the NFL. They cover the heartbreaking loss the Colts suffered this weekend at the hands of Fitzmagic and the Dolphins, question whether there will ever be another player like Lamar Jackson, Pat reiterates his formula for winning Super Bowls which includes building a team around a quarterback on a rookie contract, they discuss why other teams can't do things like the Patriots, and look at Bill Belichick's potential successor. Pat also gives out his top 4 teams for the college football playoff. Also, 3x Super Bowl Champion, 2x Pro Bowler, and friend of the show, Mark Schlereth drops by to chat about everything that happened this weekend in the NFL including why certain teams' offensive lines look incredible one week, and really bad the next, whether or not the Saints getting the doors blown off was a fluke, and why he thinks Lamar Jackson is succeeding (1:07:53-1:23:29). Later, Head Coach of the undefeated Minnesota Golden Gophers, PJ Fleck, calls into the show after a huge win against Penn State on Saturday. He discusses their mentality going forward now that the playoffs are in sight, what his message to the team was after the win and going into this week's game at Iowa, whether or not he has any fears on the football or otherwise, and as always, he gives Pat and the boys a little motivation (1:23:51-1:35:14). To close out the show, our very own Todd McComas shares some personal stories from his time in the Marines as he and the boys appreciate all past, present, and future veterans. Today's a fun one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.\n",
