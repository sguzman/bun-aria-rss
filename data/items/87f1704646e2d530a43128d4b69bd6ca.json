  "description": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">You are in the right place! Your eyes do not deceive you! We’re actually talking about spy romances this week and no Sarahs were harmed during the discussion, but that’s probably because it was a discussion with one of her favorite people, the fantastic Nana Malone! </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">We talk about Nana’s immense career, about how she took matters into her own hands and started making the covers she wished to see in the world, about her Brown Nipple reading challenge, about her latest book, a Kobo original, <em>The Spy in 3B, </em>and about porny ferris wheels. Real ordinary stuff. We also get to the bottom of why Sarah doesn’t like spy romances generally, but why she can’t get enough of <em>Mr. & Mrs. Smith </em>retellings.  </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Our next read along in some number of weeks (three? four?) is Kylie Scott’s <em>Lead</em>, one of our longtime favorites.

She is an amazing author and recently&nbsp;<a href=\"https://frolic.media/why-i-put-myself-on-my-book-covers-by-nana-malone/\">became her own cover model</a>&nbsp;after failing to find good stock photos for her books.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">If you don’t know&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.stockphotosecrets.com/questions-answers/how-do-stock-photos-work-beginners-guide.html\">how stock photography works</a>, here’s a brief primer on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.shutterstock.com/blog/stock-photos-for-book-covers\">how they can be used to make book covers and teasers</a>. The problems with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://zora.medium.com/why-i-never-use-stock-photos-of-white-people-e069868160ba\">finding stock photography that is truly diverse is a well-known problem.</a>&nbsp;For most authors, custom photography is cost-prohibitive. Nana’s favorite photographer is<a href=\"http://wanderaguiar.com/\">&nbsp;Wander Aguiar</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">If you want to hear more about romance covers and their history, Sarah was interviewed on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://99percentinvisible.org/episode/the-clinch/\">an episode of the 99% Invisible podcast</a>&nbsp;about covers this week. Head over and have a listen after you listen to this!&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Just in case you need a quick review, there are currently three paths in publishing: self-published, indie, and traditional. It’s common to use “indie” and “self-published” interchangeably, which why Nana described an author as “their own business.” Strictly speaking, Indie means small, independent presses, such as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://violetgazepress.com/\">Violet Gaze Press</a>. And Trad, or traditional publishing, refers to the Big Five&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.latimes.com/entertainment-arts/books/story/2020-12-04/the-latest-publishing-mega-merger-might-kill-off-literary-diversity\">(Big Four?)</a>&nbsp;New York publishing houses: Hachette, HarperCollins, Macmillan, Penguin Random House and Simon & Schuster.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">A little about the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://goodereader.com/blog/electronic-readers/the-history-of-kobo-and-how-they-changed-the-e-reader-market\">history of Kobo</a>&nbsp;and why it’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://financialpost.com/entrepreneur/fp-startups/how-e-reading-company-kobo-is-fighting-amazon-apple-and-google-for-your-time\">worth supporting them.&nbsp;</a></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">No one likes it when the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.smithsonianmag.com/arts-culture/these-women-coined-term-mary-sue-180972182/\">Mary Sue character</a>&nbsp;has no idea what’s going on.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Turns out that Ferris Wheel sex is a real thing&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.youredm.com/2019/04/17/nsfw-another-couple-caught-on-coachellas-ferris-wheel-this-time-actually-having-sex/\">at Coachella</a>.
