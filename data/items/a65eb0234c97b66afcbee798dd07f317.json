If you understand that, and if you acknowledge that, that’s where respect comes in.”</p> <p>Alongside Rebecca Hui, the founder of indigenous arts organisation Roots Studio, Tsuha led a compelling conversation on why cultural inspiration doesn’t always have to be problematic. Together, they suggested a framework for more mindful cross-cultural borrowing rooted in respect, reciprocity and remuneration.</p> <p><em>Want more from The Business of Fashion?
