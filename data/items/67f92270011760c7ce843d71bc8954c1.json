  "description": "<p>During the second world war, sea battles became a much more prevalent and impactful form of warfare. Great battleships and aircraft carriers became massive assets and a nation with an abundance of them was a power to be feared. This was proven in December of 1941 with the attack on Pearl Harbor which forced the hand of the US Government and set off America's involvement in WWII. Many ships were lost to the sea during battle, but one ship's legacy carried on in an interesting way. Another ship was named for it, and this ship went on to be the oldest working aircraft carrier in the US Navy. Something else continues on in the afterlife. There are many reports of unexplained happenings aboard the carrier. Join us as we explore the history and the hauntings of the USS Lexington. The Moment in Oddity is suggested by listener Toby Hessenauer and researched by Bob Sherfield and features the Gate of the Sun and This Day in History is by Jessica Bell and features Martin Luther King Jr's march to Montgomery. Research Assistant on this was provided by our Assistant Producer Steven Pappas.</p> <p>Check out the website:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/03/hgb-ep-114-uss-lexington.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/03/hgb-ep-114-uss-lexington.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer:  http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</p>",
