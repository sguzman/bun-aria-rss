  "description": "<p>St. Albans Sanatorium, in Virginia, started out as a Lutheran Boys School before becoming a psychiatric infirmary. As was the case with so many hospitals for the mentally ill, this one started out with promising expectations that unraveled into crowded conditions and abusive treatments. There were deaths and suicides. There is so much paranormal activity at this location, that many refer to this as one of the most haunted places on the East Coast. Join us, and our listener Whitney Zahar, as we delve into the history and haunts of the St. Albans Sanatorium! The Moment in Oddity was suggested by Mike Streibel and features Oran Asa Pruitt falling out of a plane and into a cemetery and This Month in History features the issuing of The Penny Black Stamp.</p> <p>Our sponsor for this episode is Kobo Audiobooks.
