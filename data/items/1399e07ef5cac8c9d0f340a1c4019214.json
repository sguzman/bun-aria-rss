  "description": "<p>Ex-jailer Vicky White commits suicide as cops close in on her and fellow fugitive Casey White.  Authorities tracked down the Alabama outlaws to a motel in Evansville, Indiana. The pair attempted to flee when they realized police had found them, which led to a chase.   A newly released  911 call appears to contain the last words of Vicky White. As sirens screech in the background,  a woman’s voice says, \"Airbags are going off! Let’s get out and run! We never should have left the hotel.\"     Dashcam video also reveals that when the vehicle rolled over, police could see that Vicky was holding a gun to her head. “She still has the gun in her hands,” one officer says in the video. “Finger’s on the trigger.”   Vicky White was hospitalized and died hours later. Casey White was extradited back to Alabama, where he has been charged with MURDER. He is already facing capital murder charges in connection with the death of Connie Ridgeway in 2015.</p>\n<p>Joining Nancy Grace Today:</p>\n<ul>\n<li>Sheriff Rick Singleton - Lauderdale County Sheriff's Office, Facebook: \"Lauderdale County Sheriff's Office\"  </li>\n<li>James Shelnutt - 27 years Atlanta Metro Area Major Case Detective, Former S.W.A.T. officer, Attorney, The Shelnutt Law Firm, P.C., www.ShelnuttLawFirm.com, Twitter: @ShelnuttLawFirm </li>\n<li>Caryn Stark - NYC Psychologist, www.carynstark.com, Twitter: @carynpsych, Facebook: \"Caryn Stark\"  </li>\n<li>Lenny DePaul - Former Chief Inspector/Commander U.
