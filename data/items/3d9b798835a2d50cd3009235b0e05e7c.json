  "description": "<p>Welcome back to The Literary Life podcast and our series on Shakespeare’s <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3FJo6Hn\">A Midsummer Night’s Dream</a>.</em> After kicking off the episode with their commonplace quotes, Angelina, Cindy and Thomas start digging into the play itself. Thomas brings up the importance of the timing of this story being midsummer. Angelina gives a little background into the names and characters in this play as well as some of the major ideas we can be looking for in the story.</p> <p>In February Angelina will be offering a webinar on Jonathan Swift: Enemy of the Enlightenment. Check it out at <a href= \"https://houseofhumaneletters.com/webinars/\">HouseofHumaneLetters.com</a>.</p> <p>Join us this spring for our next Literary Life Conference “The Battle Over Children’s Literature” featuring special guest speaker Vigen Guroian.
