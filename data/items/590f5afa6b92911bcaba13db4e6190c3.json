  "description": "<p>It’s time to get back into a sport we love on the show in Race Walking as we speak with Australian walker Rhydian Cowley about his amazing career and amazing Olympic experiences. Just how did Rhydian get into race walking and why is it more of an amazing sport than people give it credit for? Why does having the sport featured in comedy shows such as <em>Malcolm In The Middle</em> and <em>Kath & Kim</em> actually help it more than hinder it? Why does Australia seem to produce so many talented race walkers? What brought about his changeup from competing in the 20km event in Rio to the 50km event in Tokyo? How does Rhydian feel about the 50km event being dropped from Paris? And just what happened with a cat before Tokyo that may have his future wife scared for the future? It’s all here and more in another fascinating interview that you won’t want to miss!</p>",
