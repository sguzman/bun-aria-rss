  "description": "<p><p>On Episode 92, the guys catch up on a few non-Stanley Cup topics before diving into the Stanley Cup champion Washington Capitals wild, cross-country celebrations. For an insider perspective, Caps winger and certified man missile Tom Wilson joins the show to fill us in on all of the shenanigans taking D.C. by storm and well as some stories from the Cup run. Next, PFTCommenter checks in to give us the rundown on his trip to Vegas for the Cup-clincher, how exactly he managed to sip from the silver chalice, and a bunch more. Our guy Nate (upper body) also joins us to chime in on his parade plans, his heavy-duty blogging weekend, and his mission to drink from the Cup.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
