  "itunes:summary": "Regular Car Reviews describes themselves as \"Car reviews mixed with toilet humor.\" but that undersells the creativity, intelligence, and research that go into their videos. Their unique style of POV and voice over helped separate them from other channels but it was really their ability to project a strange personality and backstory onto cars and their owners that has furthered their success. Underneath the odd voices and jokes lies insightful context and automotive history.",
