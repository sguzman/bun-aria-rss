  "description": "On today's show, 3x Pro Bowler, 17 year NFL veteran at QB, current ESPN analyst and friend of the program, Matt Hasselbeck, joins the show. Pat and Matt discuss Andy Dalton signing with the Cowboys and what he thinks this means for Dak Prescott, and if he thinks he had suitors elsewhere. They also discuss Alex Smith's Project 11 and how remarkable of a story it is, and Matt gives his take on the Aaron Rodgers situation and relays a similar experience he had with Pete Carroll his last season in Seattle (1:47-21:30). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk where Pat and AJ discuss everything with the Andy Dalton situation, a potential massive guest they are booking for the show, they take another look back at the Packers draft as Mad Mel Kiper makes an appearance, discuss episodes five and six of The Last Dance, and cover everything else that is going on around the world of sports and in the NFL (24:42-1:32:25). Lastly, 3x National Sportswriter of the Year, publisher of Football Morning in America, and NBC Sports contributor, Peter King joins the show via FaceTime. Pat and Peter chat about who some of Andy Dalton's other options may have been, why he thinks the Cowboys may have signed him as a precaution in case Dak Prescott gets Covid19, the NFL planning to release their schedule this week with no international games and the regular season starting on time (with the assumption that it is subject to change), why this is such a weird market for Cam Newton, and if he has any memories from covering Michael Jordan (1:32:27-1:49:21). Don't forget to send in the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat with a picture of where you're listening to the show for the chance to win some free merch. Happy Cinco de Mayo, be safe out there. Come and laugh with us, cheers.\n",
