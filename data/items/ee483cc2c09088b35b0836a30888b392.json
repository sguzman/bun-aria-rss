  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, Republicans that trash the Tea Party and stand against liberty are the problem. America is facing a movement that is destroying the country and Rep. Liz Cheney and the Bush family are attacking Trump supporters because they have no clue of how serious the threat is. The issue with Liz Cheney is not about Liz Cheney, but its illustrative of a larger problem. A RINO problem that predates Trump and has been antagonistic toward Constitutional conservatives for decades. Liz Cheney should stand up for Liberty instead of claiming some false mantle of never-Trump leadership. Later, Minority Leader Kevin McCarthy calls in with his reaction to Liz Cheney's ouster from GOP leadership. McCarthy explained that out of all America's problems Liz Cheney was focused on Trump, not on Biden's weakness on China, the impending inflation, or our out-of-control border. McCarthy quipped that even Sen. Bernie Sanders is more conservative than Joe Biden. Then, educational materials are being used to indoctrinate students under the dangerous guise of critical race theory. These curricula pose questions like \"is everyone equal?\" Parents are speaking up and one mom in Virginia gave an eloquent rebuke of Critical Race Theory to her school board. Afterward, Former Israeli Ambassador Ron Dermer joins the show from Israel to describe what the recent terrorist rocket attacks were like. Dermer added that a heavy price must be exacted on Hamas to restore deterrence not just restoring security. This was done by eliminating several Hamas commanders. Hamas commits war crimes in these attacks by targeting Israeli civilians and launching these rockets from Hamas bunkers hidden next to schools and hospitals where they use civilian women and children as human shields. Hamas does this with the hope that Israel will be portrayed as the aggressors by propagandists in the media. Dermer added that much of Hamas' support comes from Iran and any deal that leads to nuclear Iran destabilize the entire Middle East region.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
