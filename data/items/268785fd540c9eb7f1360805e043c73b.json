As summer began and nearly all of our planned events and obligations were cancelled due to Covid-19, I started to seriously investigate my life and how I'm spending my time on a regular basis. On today's episode I discuss the Pareto Principle, a surefire method to increase efficiency and free up more time to do exactly what you love to do. I also talk about the very real consequences of decision fatigue and ways you can avoid it. This episode also includes several very important accouncements, one of which belongs to this podcast.
