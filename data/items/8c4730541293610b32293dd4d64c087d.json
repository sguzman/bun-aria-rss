  "description": "<p>Scott Soshnick, Michael Barr and Eben Novy-Williams discuss a host of issues related to the business of sports, including a new marketing campaign by the surging Brooklyn Nets. The campaign, dubbed ``Bet on Brooklyn,'' will be featured around Wall Street as the team targets fans in Manhattan. The team is offering a locked in, two-year price for season tickets. The campaign will include branded coffee carts in the Wall Street and Fulton Street subway stations. Also discussed is Pepsi's attempt to market during the Super Bowl in Atlanta, the home of rival Coke. The NFL has specific rules as to what Coke can -- and cannot -- do because Pepsi is a league sponsor. Also talked about is the trade request by Anthony Davis, who told the New Orleans Pelicans that he'd rather play elsewhere in a move that could reshape the NBA's balance of power. </p><p>Hosts: Scott Soshnick, Michael Barr and Eben Novy-WilliamsProducer: Madena Parwana</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
