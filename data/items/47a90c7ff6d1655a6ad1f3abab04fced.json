  "description": "<p>Kirk Minihane is looking for a new producer. This morning he pored over the stack of \"applications\" that have been submitted so far to see if any worthy candidates have thrown their hats in the ring. Kirk has officially cancelled the KMS Wrap Up Show after Intern Justin's dreadful performance. A Minifan rediscovered old footage of a young Steve Robinson interviewing on a local public access television program. Kirk opens the phones so the Minifans can ask Steve more questions about his controversial decision to leave the show.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music. For more, visit <a href=\"https://barstool.link/kminshow\">barstool.link/kminshow</a></p>",
