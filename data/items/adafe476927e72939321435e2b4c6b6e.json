  "description": "<p>We take for granted that products on the store shelves are, not only good for us, but safe as well. Little do we realize that industries involved in things like supplements and personal care products are largely unregulated.</p> <p>To take it even further… many companies are allowed to use ingredients that are known to be toxic to the human body (several of them banned in other countries outside the U.S.). Yet, we here we are brushing, rubbing, shampooing, and soaking ourselves in chemical soups each day, blind-as-a-bat to the hazardous effects (and keep these products out of your eyes or it might not just be a figure of speech).</p> <p>The issue is so grand, but I wanted to put a nice PSA together to talk about a few of the most pervasive and problematic chemicals in popular personal care products. Take good notes, and take action on what you see fit. And definitely share this one out with the people you care about as well.
