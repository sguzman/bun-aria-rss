  "description": "<p>In 1893, Sir Arthur Conan Doyle \"killed\" Sherlock Holmes. Eight years later, the popular detective returned in&nbsp;The Hound of the Baskervilles, much to the delight of Doyle's mother. </p><p>Why was Doyle unable to abandon his creation? Why have the zany detective and his Everyman sidekick Watson endured for over a century? Maybe we'll answer those questions. At the very least, we'll talk about how nerds have kept the crime-fighting duo alive for new generations to enjoy in print and onscreen. </p><p>In this week's episode, we'll also discuss the adventures of Sir Arthur \"Iggy\" Conan Doyle, Professor Challenge, nerd rage, and (last but not least) hellhounds.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
