  "description": "President Trump sits down with Clay and Buck, live remote from the Trump National Golf Club Bedminster for a full-hour interview where the controversial LIV golf tournament is going on. In addition to President Trump complimenting Clay’s golf game from yesterday, Clay says, “I don’t think there should be controversy when Joe Biden’s showing up doing fist pounds in Saudi Arabia. I don’t know how you can’t have golf in America.”  President Trump stops just short of announcing whether he’ll run again, but says he has made up his mind and goes over the pluses and minuses of announcing before or after the midterms. President Trump goes over all the proof behind his strong statement to C&B that, “Our country is going to hell.” Joking that some of his comments might get C&B show thrown off the air, Buck says not to worry because, “We are an unsinkable air carrier of free speech.”<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
