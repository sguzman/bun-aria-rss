  "description": "In the third week of our series Mo’ Money Mo’ Problems, we had the incredible opportunity to hear from Pastor Robert Morris of Gateway Church in Dallas/Fort Worth, Texas. His practical example on the importance of tithing made for a powerful message. We learned that tithing is a test, it’s biblical and it’s personal! If you’re looking for wisdom and insight on tithing, this is the message for you. <br /><br />#MoMoneyMoProblems #finances #tithing #generosity #RobertMorris<br /><br />Join us for service online every Sunday at 11am (CST) and on Monday’s for Monday Night Prayer at 6pm (CST). <br /><br />If you received Christ through this message, text SAVED to 828282.<br /><br />We would love to hear how God is touching your life through this ministry!
