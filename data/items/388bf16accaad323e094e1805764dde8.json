  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, Democrats are pushing massive American Marxist plans to push social programs and spend trillions - even if they lower it by a trillion dollars - that will enshrine lasting changes to our lives by simply letting the debt grow. Frauds, fools, and phonies are saying that we're paying for programs that President Trump enacted, which is a lie. Even in a government shutdown, the government will continue collecting taxes. Another line that Democrats are telling is that the government will default on the debt service, this is also false because the federal government will have enough money to cover it from tax revenue. Now, raising the debt ceiling is about future spending, not about paying debt service, and this must be stopped. The Constitution is clear on this, the President cannot usurp the authority of Congress to commandeer their power of the purse. Then, the \"Build Back Better\" initiative uses taxes to fund leftwing armies during election day. They have fused the powers of government with the needs of the Democrat Party. Just like Gen. Mark Milley used the power of the military to his benefit. Later, Stuart and Kathy Scheller, call in, they are the parents of Marine Lt. Col. Stuart Scheller who is currently in prison for publicly criticizing his chain of command over the Afghanistan withdrawal. The Scheller's said he fell on his own sword because he felt the need to stand up for the 13 slaughtered Marines and all the Marines that have served under him. The Scheller's coveted the prayers of all Americans for their son's situation. Afterward, the CDC is looking to fund a study to promote the left's position that guns are violent and are a public health crisis. This is another way to steal people's liberty.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
