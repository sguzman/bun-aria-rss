  "description": "<div>In this week’s Book Club podcast, I’m joined by the writer China Miéville to talk about his new book <em>A Spectre, Haunting: On The Communist Manifesto</em>. China makes the case for why this 1848 document deserves our attention in the 21st century, why even its critics would benefit from reading it more closely and sympathetically, and why - in his view - the gamble of a revolutionary abolition of capitalism is not only possible, but well worth taking.</div>\n",
