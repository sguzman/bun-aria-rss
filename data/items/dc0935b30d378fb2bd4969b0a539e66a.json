They also discuss whether or not Oprah being brought into the equation will be enough to completely swing the public perception of Michael Jackson. &nbsp;On Ash Wednesday, the guys talk about what they're planning on giving up for Lent which leads into a discussion about some of their favorite different sandwich spots, they try to pin down what the undisputed king of all cereals is and argue what the best national pizza chain is. They also dive into how much Game of Thrones moves the needle as they give their reactions to some plot news that was released yesterday as well as the first complete trailer for the final season. They also chat about Kylie Jenner becoming a \"self-made\" billionaire, how Kris Jenner still has a lot of juice on her fastball, and wonder whether or not LeBron might be playing drunk on the court as they try to figure what the hell is wrong with the Lakers.
