  "description": "<p>     This week Michael and Steve welcome Sopranos writer and producer Matt Weiner to the podcast. Matt was an award-winning writer on the Sopranos but also created the incredible TV series Mad Men. He is a fascinating person and in 2011 he was named one of Time Magazine’s 100 most influential people in the world. This is a candid and emotional interview where Matt talks about his difficult early days, working with David Chase and Jim’s passing. </p><p>    Then Michael and Steve break down this week’s episode which Matt wrote. It’s a crazy one that definitely needs some explaining. Along the way Steve reads his living obituary which includes an intro to the Steve Motherf**ks the world video. He also busts Michael’s chops about where he shops and the fact he has never been to Cosco. Michael also tells a great story about how he and Steve went to Jamaica and tried to get into Hedonism but were denied. </p><p>    Check out Talking Sopranos Ep #64 “The Test Dream” S5-Ep11.
