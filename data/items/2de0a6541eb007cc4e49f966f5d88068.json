  "description": "<p>In this essay I will consider a sequence of questions, ending with one about\nthe breadth and depth of the epistemic limitations of our our science and\nmathematics. I will then suggest a possible way to circumvent such limitations.\nI begin by considering questions about the biological function of intelligence.\nThis will lead into questions concerning human language, perhaps the most\nimportant cognitive prosthesis we have ever developed. While it is traditional\nto rhapsodize about the perceptual power provided by human language, I will\nemphasize how horribly limited - and therefore limiting - it is. This will lead\nto questions of whether human mathematics, being so deeply grounded in our\nlanguage, is also deeply limited. I will then combine all of this into a\npartial, sort-of, sideways answer to the guiding question of this essay: what\nwe can ever discern about all that we cannot even conceive of?\n</p>",
