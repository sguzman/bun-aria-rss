  "description": "\"Full Frontal\" host Samantha Bee and TBS President Kevin Reilly talk with Recode's Peter Kafka, recorded in front of a live audience at Joe's Pub in New York City. Bee dissects how her show has approached the sexual assault scandals rocking Silicon Valley and Hollywood, particularly that of movie producer Harvey Weinstein, and why her show is able to cover them so well. She also talks about \"Trump fatigue\" and why Amazon CEO Jeff Bezos's excuses for the lack of diversity among the company's top executives \"sound like such fucking horseshit to me.\" Reilly talks about how Turner approaches Bee's comedy show as a business and why it's not worrying about where people are watching the show — unlike some of the traditional broadcast networks.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
