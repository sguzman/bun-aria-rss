  "description": "Lily tells Elizabeth she’s going to try to sell Russ’s painting of her to an art dealer who admires Russ’s work.  Elizabeth wonders whether the dealer will be interested now it’s got “Prodosia” on the certificate of provenance.  Later Lily explains to the dealer that she and Russ have split up; she can see that Russ had unwittingly captured the seeds of Lily’s betrayal in the painting.  When the dealer offers eight hundred pounds, Lily says it’s worth considerably more and he accepts.  Later Elizabeth can’t believe what Lily did and tells her to keep all of the money – she’s earned it!\nAlan despairs when Emma says that Neil’s in favour of Peggy’s stained glass window, and she now thinks he may have a point.  Alan worries to Usha that if Neil’s daughter can’t convince Neil, what hope does Alan have?  He later tells Usha the PCC meeting was a disaster, with a unanimous vote in favour of Peggy’s window.  When Usha’s hopeful that someone higher up the church might pull the plug, Alan’s not convinced.\nEddie’s set for his romantic evening with Clarrie, with wine, desserts and an offer to help with dinner.  But later as they settle down to watch a romantic film, the baa-ing from a distressed Texel sheep disturbs them.  They notice it’s stuck in the hedge, and with Ed away, Eddie has to sort it. Clarrie’s roped in to help and Eddie’s sent flying into the mud by the freed sheep!  They laughingly  agree that their romantic evening hasn’t turned out quite as planned!",
