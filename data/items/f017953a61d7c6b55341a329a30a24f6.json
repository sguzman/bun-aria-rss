  "description": "<p>There is no moving up and out in the world unless we are fully acquainted with the person we are meant to be. Whatever our calling, it’s already rooted within, and while those roots may get trampled on or tugged at, they can never be removed. They grow stronger only when tended, nurtured and most importantly, shared with others. In this Super Soul conversation, Oprah Winfrey sits down with such inspired writers and thinkers as Nate Berkus, Brian Grazer, Lin-Manuel Miranda, Tracy Morgan, Sister Joan Chittister, the Rev. Ed Bacon, RuPaul Charles, Glennon Doyle, President Joe Biden and Pastor Wintley Phipps. Each share individual stories of what it was like to tap into their own roots and wellsprings of talent to discover their greater purpose and deeper levels of fulfillment. Interviews with these talented writers, speakers and thought leaders are excerpted from Oprah’s Emmy Award-winning show Super Soul Sunday. You can also find this compilation, and other insightful conversations, in Oprah’s best-selling book <em>The Path Made Clear.</em></p>\n",
