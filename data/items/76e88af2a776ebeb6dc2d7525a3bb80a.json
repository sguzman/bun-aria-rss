  "description": "<p>This week the Bayers are joined by bestselling author, Dan Ozzi whose book \"Sellout\" comes out on paperback tomorrow! To celebrate we reminisce about the time Dan had a VIP experience with Jonah and his parents at a New York Yankees game (thanks to Vanessa and Lorne Michaels) and which corporations have the best snacks, ranging from free Luna bars at Dan's ex-employer VICE to the time he loaded up on free desserts at Google. From there we get into our topic, where Dan compares his job working at a Toys \"R\" Us on Staten Island to Jonah's experience of working at a Kids \"R\" Us in suburban Ohio. It turns out Dan's job was like a Coen Safdie brothers movie with Simpsons figurines while Jonah's job was more like a movie directed by a very boring director that ends with him getting fired for playing a Tori Amos song on the local news. Finally, we play another round of \"Legit Moan or Unnecessary Groan\" where we debate if the United States are Un-united, discuss how littering with garbage is different than littering with language and recap the basic tenets of tipping for those Cleveland Plain Dealer readers who feel that working at Pizza Hut for minimum wage is a job that you should be grateful to have. Did we mention Dan's book is coming out in paperback? </p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
