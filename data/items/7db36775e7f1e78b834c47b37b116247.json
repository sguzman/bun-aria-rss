  "description": "Lester Bower. Oct 08, 1983. Sherman, Texas. Four men are discovered murdered in a hangar at the B&B ranch near Sherman, Texas. An investigation will uncover a prime suspect by the name of Lester Bower. He was to meet up there with the others to purchase an ultralight aircraft not long before the killings occurred. For some time, Lester maintained that he didn't go to the hangar and wasn't buying the ultralight. A search warrant was issued and evidence was found on his property. Including the very ultralight that was offered to him for sale. A trial will result in his conviction and he will be sentenced to death. With no eyewitnesses, no murder weapon, no fingerprints and a seemingly clean record up to that point, many believe Lester Bower to be innocent of the crimes. Was there evidence that proves that he was responsible for the murders? Or was he a victim of a justice system looking to quickly close a case?\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
