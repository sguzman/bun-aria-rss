Tokarevsky<br/>\n     <b>category:</b>  General Science and Philosophy<br/>\n     <b>type:</b>      submission<br/>\n     <b>date:</b>      2022-10-31 01:01:39 <br/>\n     <b>abstract:</b>  \nThis article presents and grounds (i.e. presents proof of the existence, the truth, the self-consistence and the completeness of) the informational concept (\"the Information as Absolute\" concept) in philosophy and sciences, which was developing from 2007 year till now. The concept defines the Information as ultimately common, real and fundamental \"absolute\" phenomenon, which exists as absolutely infinite set (\"Information\" Set) of elements (members) and informational (e.g., logical) links between the elements; where any element itself is some informational structure also. Correspondingly, for example, Matter as the substance, radiation, etc., is some system of informational patterns, constituting a specific, and practically infinitesimal comparing to the Set, element \"Matter\" of the \"Information\" Set. The concept allows for the resolution, or at least for a consideration on a higher level of rational comprehension, of basic ontological and epistemological problems in philosophy and natural sciences; it clarifies basic fundamental notions such as space, time, energy, etc., and so is the fundamental base for real development of science\n  \n   "
