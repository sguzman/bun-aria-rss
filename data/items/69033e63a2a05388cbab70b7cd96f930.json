But after taking some time to sit with the album, Las Culturistas has takes on the ongoing battle between Taylor vs. Tayla and how it exists in this body of work. The boys discuss each song on the album, and also get into this season of Drag Race UK and how Bimini Bon Boulash is their ONLY winner, the recent Snatch Game on RuPaul's Drag Race, final WandaVision thoughts, and Netflix's I Care A Lot. Also, though this episode was recording literally <em>while </em>Oprah's interview with Meghan and Harry was airing, the royal family is, let's just say, discussed in the episode's closing moments.
