  "description": "<p>“He thinks of himself as a character in a fairy tale in a way who's going on a quest. And there's so many stories like that about a character who's going in search of a lost loved one, whether it's a daughter, a mother, a son, there's this sense of <em>I'm going off to find you</em>. And that's really powerful.” Celeste Ng follows her massive hit <em>Little Fires Everywhere</em> with a novel set in a world that “looks like ours, but with the volume kind of turned up to 11” in <a href= \"https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/our-missing-hearts-celeste-ng/1140902113?ean=9780593492543\"><em>Our Missing Hearts</em></a>, an indelible story about family and identity, art and connection. Celeste joins us on the show to talk about the novel she never planned to write, mothers and sons, coming-of-age (for adults <em>and</em> children), Asian American history, pushing against our ideas of hero figures, being a word nerd and her love of Shakespeare, her literary influences and more with Poured Over’s host, Miwa Messer.
