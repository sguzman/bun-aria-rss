  "description": "<p>The novel coronavirus has had a domino-like effect on so many areas of our lives including our finances. Maybe you’ve lost your job and have had to file for unemployment for the first time ever. Or perhaps you technically still have a job but you have been furloughed and are realizing how little you have in savings. Most of the lessons we’re going to discuss in this episode aren’t brand new, but due to the health crisis, they’re more important than ever. It’s vital to reflect on those lessons so that we don’t forget them - not only do we need to put those lessons to work now during the pandemic, but we also need to continue to implement that knowledge in a way that continues to help us for years to come.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Modus Vivendi by The Wild Beer Co out of England!
