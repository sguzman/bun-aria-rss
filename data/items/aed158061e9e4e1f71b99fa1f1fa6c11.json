  "description": "In 2008, The Low Anthem's members were volunteering at the Newport Folk Festival, helping to maintain the grounds. The next year, they were on stage, winning the home-state crowd's affections with their frequently gorgeous mix of folk, rock and wrenchingly atmospheric ballads. With a grab bag of unexpected instrumentation in tow, The Low Anthem again joins the Newport lineup in 2010, returning to the haunting sounds of its big-label debut, 'Oh My God, Charlie Darwin.'",
