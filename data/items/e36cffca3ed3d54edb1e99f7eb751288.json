Why?\n\nWell, if you've been convicted in Mississippi of one of these 22 crimes, you may never get your right to vote back again, even after serving your prison sentence. Yep, even for bigamy, which just means getting married to someone when you’re still married to someone else.\n\nNow, there are two ways someone who has been convicted of one of those 22 crimes can POSSIBLY get their right to vote back.\n\nThey can either receive a pardon directly from the governor OR, and this is kinda crazy, convince the Mississippi legislature to pass a law specifically granting them the right to vote again. And of course this only passes if 2/3 of both houses of the legislature approve of it.\nAnd that is VERY unlikely to happen.\n\nToday, around 93% of Mississippi residents who have committed one of those 22 crimes AND already served their time CANNOT vote.",
