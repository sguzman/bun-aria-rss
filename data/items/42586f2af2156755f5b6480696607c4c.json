She’ll explain the impact the coronavirus has had on our mental health and why we can’t waste any time rethinking our traditional expectations of therapy in a post-Covid world.\nIf you or someone you love is struggling with mental health, we encourage you to seek out professional help or find resources from the National Alliance on Mental Illness.",
