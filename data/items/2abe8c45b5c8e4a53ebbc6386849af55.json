  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, we have heard a lot about the need for evidence but many of the people in the media screaming about the alleged lack of evidence of voter fraud have themselves advanced many wild claims and insisted that we shouldn’t require evidence to believe them. We’ll go over some of those wild claims today. Also Five Headlines including some in the American public beginning to stand up and resist the unconstitutional lockdown orders. This is what is needed if we’re ever going to be free again. And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll cancel a woman in Canada who successfully shut down a pop up restaurant because it had committed the sin of cultural appropriation. But we’re also going to cancel the owner of that restaurant for caving to the outrage mob.\nIf you like The Matt Walsh Show, become a member TODAY with promo code: WALSH and enjoy the exclusive benefits for 10% off at https://www.dailywire.com/walsh\nLearn more about your ad choices.
