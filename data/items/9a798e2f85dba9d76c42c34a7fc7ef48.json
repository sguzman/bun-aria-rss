  "description": "<p>As we move into Thanksgiving 2020, many of us might find it difficult to be thankful for anything in this dumpster fire of a year while others might be the exact opposite. However, 70 years ago in North Korea, many soldiers of the UN forces would be in the same boat in more ways than one. Thanksgiving Day 1950 was followed by a massive onslaught from the Chinese 13th Army as they smashed into the U.S. Eighth Army at the Ch'ongch'on River (Nov. 25 - Dec. 2, 1950). This marked the beginning of the Chinese Second Phase Offensive, the result of which saw the Chinese deal the UN forces a decisive defeat and transform the Korean War into an entirely new conflict. Join Avery for his solo presentation of one of the most chaotic blunders in American military history. Enjoy and stay safe out there!</p>",
