  "description": "Pirates have been around for a very long time. In fact, as far as the historical record seems to show, they have been around for as long as there have been property and boats.\n\n\n\nWhat is it that attracts us to pirates and why have we got such a well-developed set of pirate tropes? We all have the same picture when we think of pirates: peg legs and eyepatches, parrots and pirate accents, walking the plank, buried treasure, the jolly roger.\n\n\n\nProf Manushag Powell joins me to discuss the Golden Age of Piracy, pirate literature, and the history behind the pirates of popular culture. \n\n\n\nFor shownotes, links, transcripts, and more head to wttepodcast.com\n\n\n\nJoin the WTTE pirate crew and support the show at patreon.com/wtte",
