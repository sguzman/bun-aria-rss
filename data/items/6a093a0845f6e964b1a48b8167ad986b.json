  "description": "<p>Learning-based grasping can afford real-time motion planning of\nmulti-fingered robotics hands thanks to its high computational efficiency.\nHowever, it needs to explore large search spaces during its learning process.\nThe search space causes low learning efficiency, which has been the main\nbarrier to its practical adoption. In addition, the generalizability of the\ntrained policy is limited unless they are identical or similar to the trained\nobjects. In this work, we develop a novel Physics-Guided Deep Reinforcement\nLearning with a Hierarchical Reward Mechanism to improve the learning\nefficiency and generalizability for learning-based autonomous grasping. Unlike\nconventional observation-based grasp learning, physics-informed metrics are\nutilized to convey correlations between features associated with hand\nstructures and objects to improve learning efficiency and outcomes. Further, a\nhierarchical reward mechanism is developed to enable the robot to learn the\ngrasping task in a prioritized way. It is validated in grasping tasks with a\nMICO robot arm in both simulation and physical experiments. The results show\nthat our method outperformed the standard Deep Reinforcement learning method in\ntask performance by 48% and learning efficiency by 40%.\n</p>",
