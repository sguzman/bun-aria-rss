  "description": "<p>Season 2, Episode 5</p> <p>Team Deakins has the pleasure in this episode of speaking with a set decorator, Kamlan Man (NO TIME TO DIE, PHANTOM THREAD, SKYFALL).We explore the role of set decorator in depth and learn all kinds of things. We learn how small items can tell the story of a character, the steps for properly dressing a location and compare dressing built sets vs locations. We also discuss the set decorator’s relationship with the props department and definitely dive into the conversation of using practical lights and her relationship with the cinematographer. A full look at the job of a set decorator!</p>",
