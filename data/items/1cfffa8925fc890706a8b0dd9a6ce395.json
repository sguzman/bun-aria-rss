  "description": "Sir John Elliott, Regius Professor Emeritus of Modern History at Oxford University, one of the premier historians writing in English on Spanish and European History in the Early Modern period, has now delighted his many ardent readers and admirers by writing a superb book dealing with the comparative histories of Scottish and Catalan nationalism. Scots and Catalans: Union and Disunion (Yale University Press, 2018) is by turns both erudite and easily informative. Sir John’s book entrances the reader and provides a way for the lay educated public as well as the academic audience to make sense of these two differing and yet at crucial times similar nationalist movements. Another splendid book by the prize-winning author of The Revolt of the Catalans, Richelieu & Olivares, The Count-Duke Olivares and The Empires of the Atlantic. The podcast was done from Sir John’s quarters at Oriel College at Oxford.\n\nCharles Coutinho holds a doctorate in history from New York University. Where he studied with Tony Judt, Stewart Stehlin and McGeorge Bundy. His Ph. D. dissertation was on Anglo-American relations in the run-up to the Suez Crisis of 1956.
