  "description": "<div>Duncan Trussell and I talked about LSD for about 2 hours. Nobody in my life is more of an acidhead than Duncan. He knows the history, the risks, the joys, all of it. We did this in honor of Bicycle Day, which is April 19. The day LSD was first ingested intentionally by Albert Hofmann. Also, the excuse for having this conversation at all was so I could help tell the world about Duncan's new Netflix show, \"The Midnight Gospel.\" It's starts 4/20 on Netflix. All the episodes available at once. He did it with Pendleton Ward, the guy who made Adventure Time. I haven't been this excited for a new show in maybe forever! I'm not even exaggerating. Duncan's mind works on another level and this is so clearly a product of all the weird creativity he's been developing over the last 20 years that I've known him. </div> <div> </div> <div>For sure set a reminder in your Netflix settings to watch The Midnight Gospel as soon as it comes out! https://www.netflix.com/<wbr />title/80987903</div> <div> </div> <div>You can also listen to Duncan't podcast, The Duncan Trussell Family Hour here</div>",
