  "description": "<p><p>A wild week for the Kirk Minihane Show became curiouser and curiouser last evening as the boys dined and gambled at Foxwoods. Minihane provides the latest on what should be the final resolution to the Benjamin Allbright saga. Blind Mike and Steve Robinson tore it up last night with some Minifans. Mike tells a story about Mama Geary that doesn't do as he planned and walks us through is riveting phone call with Dave Portnoy.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
