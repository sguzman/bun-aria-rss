  "description": "In Game of Thrones leadership decisions were made with the help of dragons and Moon Doors and Valyrian steel daggers. In America today, people play just as rough but their tools are cyber warfare, disinformation, mobilized extremist groups and court orders that suppress the vote. It is so sordid it makes you wish there were still a dragon or two available. But absent that, understanding and preparing for the threats democracy faces is our best option. That's on this episode we speak to former FBI Agent and cyber specialist Clint Watts, former White House official Dr. Kavita Patel and \"Just Security\" co-editor and NYU law professor Ryan Goodman. Don't miss it.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
