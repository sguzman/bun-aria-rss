Today, I’m so excited to talk to an old friend and pioneer of integrative medicine whose work has guided my path as a doctor, Dr. Andrew Weil. We take a deep dive into the body’s innate healing capacity and how food is our greatest ally to support that process.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Dr. Andrew Weil is a world-renowned leader and pioneer in the field of integrative medicine. Combining a Harvard education and a lifetime of practicing natural and preventive medicine, he is the founder and director of the Andrew Weil Center for Integrative Medicine at the University of Arizona, where he is a clinical professor of medicine and professor of public health. A <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author, Dr. Weil is the author of 15 books on health and wellbeing, including <em>Mind Over Meds: Know When Drugs Are Necessary, When Alternatives Are Better</em>, and <em>When to Let Your Body Heal on Its Own; Fast Food, Good Food; True Food: Seasonal, Sustainable, Simple, Pure; Spontaneous Happiness; Healthy Aging</em>; and <em>Eight Weeks to Optimum Health</em>.
