  "description": "<p class=\"\" data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">Drs. Nathan and Sunil have more <a href=\"https://www.aimsinstitute.net\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">degrees and certifications</a> than I can list here. Even more impressive than all that paperwork is the fact that both of them have dedicated their lives to finding innovative ways to help people who are suffering in the deepest ways. At the <a href=\"https://www.aimsinstitute.net\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AIMS Institute</a> in Seattle, WA, they are exploring the use of Ketamine, psilocybin, and other modalities to treat the toughest forms of dis-ease.
