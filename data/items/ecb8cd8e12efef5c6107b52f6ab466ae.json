  "description": "In a way, Ty Segall has the life Marc always wanted. Still in his mid-20s, Ty already has eight solo albums, as well as others with various bands, and rubs shoulders with rock legends while making music with his long-time friends. That probably explains why Marc is so excited to get a modern rock lesson from Ty, covering pyschedelia, noise rock, no wave and modern punk. Ty also explains his DIY approach to creating albums, which is not unfamiliar to a podcaster like Marc. <p>Sign up here for WTF+ to get the full show archives and weekly bonus material!  <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast\">https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast</a>.</p>\n\n<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
