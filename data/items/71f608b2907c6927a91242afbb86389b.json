  "description": "<p>There's an unspoken timeline that people supposedly need to follow to have a successful life: be a good student in high school, get into a good college, and then get a good job right after you graduate. </p>\n<p>But you've probably met successful people whose lives didn't follow this kind of linear arc and neat timeline, and maybe yours didn't either. Their young adult years weren't very auspicious, and they didn't come into their own and find their bearings until after college, or even much later. My guest today explores the upsides of this kind of trajectory in his book: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1524759759/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1524759759&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>Late Bloomers: The Power of Patience in a World Obsessed with Early Achievement</em></a>. His name is <a href=\"http://richkarlgaard.com/\">Rich Karlgaard</a> and we begin our conversation discussing how he defines a late bloomer and a few examples of some famous late bloomers in history. We then dig into how late bloomers got a bad rap and how society became increasingly obsessed with finding success at a young age. Rich then walks us through the disadvantages of being an early bloomer and the advantages of being a late bloomer, including resilience, self-awareness, and a healthy, motivating sense of self-doubt. </p>\n<p>Get the show notes at <a href=\"aom.is/latebloomer\">aom.is/latebloomer</a>.</p>\n",
