  "description": "<p>Rachel files suit against her husband, Doug. Early in their marriage, she brought cookies to his family's Christmas Eve celebration. Doug and his brothers realized the cookies were similar to a beloved family recipe that had been lost to time. 20 years later, Doug and his brothers still refer to these cookies as their \"Great Grandma Hebig's cookies.\" But, Rachel thinks she deserves the credit for cookies. Who's right? Who's wrong? Thank you to Jeremy Frank for naming this week's case!
