  "description": "Joe Biden is doing a remarkable job. Public support for Biden's bold economic initiatives is exceptionally high. But there are warning signs about what may be around the next bend in American politics. The GOP is punishing those in its ranks who dared to speak the truth. The most extreme actors on the right seem to have the best prospects. Republicans are posed to do well in the 2022 mid-terms. And if that happens, will this moment be seen as a momentary return to sanity before we continue the Trumpian slide to neo-fascism? Do threats to democracy elsewhere in the world, such as India, forebode ill as well? We discuss with Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University, Max Boot of the Washington Post and Ed Luce of the Financial Times. Pour yourself a stiff drink and tune in.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
