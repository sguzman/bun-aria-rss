  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Continuing the Women's History Month winemaker series, I speak with Marina Marcarino of Punset in Barbaresco, Italy. She is one of Italy's most respected and influential female winemakers. In the late 1980's, she ignored the norm and converted her family’s estate into a 100% certified organic vineyard. She is a kind, smart, savvy woman in wine and I learned so much from her about Barbaresco and organic farming -- you will too!</span></p> <p><a href=\"http://www.punset.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\"><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\"><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/M1.jpg\" alt=\"\" width= \"329\" height=\"432\" /></span></a></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style= \"font-size: 8pt;\"><a href=\"http://www.punset.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Photo: Punset</a></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">Here are the show notes:</span></p> <ul> <li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">We discuss Marina's childhood in Piemonte, the town of Alba and what it's really known for (hint: NUTELLA!) and why being a \"bad baby\" led her on a path to making organic wine.</span></li> <li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">It's Women's History Month so we spend some time discussing her experiences as a woman in the wine industry and what it's like to raise a child and be a winemaker.</span></li> <li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">We learn all about Barbaresco -- the difference with Barolo, the unique geographic features -- the Tanaro River, the consistent breezes, the differences between the diverse winemaking areas, and why the wines are so consistently good.</span></li> <li><span style=\"font-size: 12pt;\">We pivot to discuss farming and Marina's passion for organics.
