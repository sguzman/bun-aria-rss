  "description": "Published by intellect books in 2016, and currently distributed by The University of Chicago Press, Entering Transmasculinity: The Inevitability of Discourse is a holistic study of the intersecting and overlapping discourses that shape the identities of people who were assigned the female sex at birth and do not identify with that designation. Using a wide range of sources such youtube videos, academic texts, counseling literature, educational pamphlets, popular media, and personal blogs, matthew heinz examines the mediated and experienced transmasculine subjectivities and aims to capture the apparent contradictions that structure transmasculine experience, perception, and identification.\nDr. matthew heinz is vice-provost of Graduate and Interdisciplinary Studies, dean of the College of Interdisciplinary Studies and a professor in the School of Communication and Culture at Royal Roads University in British Columbia, Canada. His scholarly work focuses on the intersections of language, gender identity and culture. He examines intercultural and international communication via performative writing, qualitative studies and discourse analysis. A native of Germany, he spent 20 years in the United States as a student, print journalist, communication specialist and professor before moving to Canada.\nDr. Isabel Machado is a Postdoctoral Fellow in the Department of History at the University of Memphis. Her forthcoming book uses Carnival as a vehicle to understand social and cultural changes in Mobile, Alabama (USA) in the second half of the 20th century. Her new research project is an investigation of different generations of artists and performers who challenge gender normativity in Monterrey, Nuevo León (Mexico). She also works as an Assistant Producer for the Sexing History podcast.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
