  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, it will be one of the most unimaginable and shocking ironies if the federal department responsible for protecting us from pandemics were actually responsible for funding it and covering it up. Science editor Nicholas Wade blew the lid off of the COVID origins findings that were unequivocal, that there was never any evidence that coronavirus came from an animal to human infection. The Wuhan Institute of Virology is suspected of increasing the lethality of coronavirus in its labs. Recently leaked emails show that Anthony Fauci was concerned about the virus having originated in a Chinese lab. However, the media went out of their way to discredit anyone that questioned Fauci on this point. Labeling President Trump and other skeptics as 'conspiracy theorists.' Even now, with all the control Democrats have in Congress not a single congressional committee has launched any oversight investigations into this. Then, every day the American Marxists figure out new ways to implement their beliefs which in turn destroys most Americans' way of life. The citizenry must come to grips with pushing back on the efforts of Marxists to change our culture through the entertainment industry, academia, and our government. Later, Democrats have not relented on nationalizing zoning codes to allow for higher occupancy in suburbs as an act of creating equity. School boards are being overrun with leftist ideas and now they want to federalize residential communities. Afterward, Naftali Bennett, a one-time aide to Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu, is now siding with the opposition in an attempt to become Prime Minister himself.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
