  "description": "On Thursday’s Mark Levin show, Kathleen Landerkin, the foul-mouthed Deputy Warden of the DC jail housing January 6th detainees, must be thrilled to mistreat the 'white racist’ inmates at her facility. According to a recent report, these detainees are suffering because of the Deputy Warden's political bias. Afterward, the U.S military is employing Gender Advisers to advance the leftwing culture within the military. Later, the public's pressure on Congress has succeeded in killing the provision to allow women to be drafted for war. The Build Back Better plan has been blunted and the radical element of the Democrat Party is now attacking Sen. Joe Manchin for holding the line thus far against the far left. Then, Liz Cheney continues her fake news fabricated narrative that Trump's refusal to act for 187 minutes was an extreme dereliction of duty, despite the fact that a review of Trump's timeline has revealed that there was no such delay. Trump in fact addressed the demonstrators and thanked law enforcement just 25 minutes after the first breach, according to the FBI as reported by the Washington Post.  Afterward, China is infiltrating American college campuses through Beijing-controlled Confucius Institutes. China is a dangerous enemy that must not be taken lightly. Finally, Bret Baier calls in to discuss his book, To Rescue the Republic: Ulysses S. Grant, the Fragile Union, and the Crisis of 1876.\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Rescue-Republic-Ulysses-Fragile-Crisis/dp/0063039540/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=bret+baier&qid=1639607800&sr=8-1\nLearn more about your ad choices.
