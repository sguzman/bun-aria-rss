Jones<br/>\n     <b>category:</b>  Algebra<br/>\n     <b>type:</b>      submission<br/>\n     <b>date:</b>      2022-10-31 14:48:57 <br/>\n     <b>abstract:</b>  \nThis is a primer for Chapter 3 of Hadlock's book Field Theory and Its Classical Problems: Solution by Radicals.  We take a rather naive perspective and consider the linear and quadratic cases afresh and evolve what is really met by solving a polynomial by radicals.  There are what we consider to be several hidden premises that some students might be subconsciously puzzled about.\n  \n   "
