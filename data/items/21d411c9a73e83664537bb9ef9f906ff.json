  "description": "Buck is broadcasting from WIOD in Miami after attending the Ron DeSantis-Charlie Crist debate last night in Fort Pierce, Florida. Of the differences in \"decorum\" and shouting from the Crist side he heard, Buck says, \"This is the most action Fort Pierce has had in a long time... They had to escort out some of the Crist people.\" The latest polling data from around the nation. C&B review the DeSantis-Crist debate, preview Oz-Fetterman. Buck predicts the winner of the New York governor's race, but says he won't \"get too greedy\" by thinking Dems will take both Michigan and New York. What Hillary's already saying about the 2024 election. Clay points out the hypocrisy. Lib political analyst Matthew Dowd says anyone who doesn't vote for Democrats is a Nazi -- or, as Clay translated, \"at least Nazi adjacent.\" DeSantis buries Crist on question about serving his full term. Biden tries to wish Kamala happy birthday, fails.<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
