  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat is joined by a couple of great guests to celebrate the return of sports. First, Super Bowl Champion as defensive coordinator with the Baltimore Ravens, former Head Coach of the New York Jets and Buffalo Bills, and current ESPN analyst, Rex Ryan joins the program. Pat and Rex chat about his time as a Head Coach and the mindset that he carried, why he was always destined to coach, how you defend an offense like the Chiefs, how excited he is for the baseball season, and why we need football back in the fall (:42-27:52). Next, Pat and AJ Hawk are joined by 3x All-Star, Cincinnati Reds Hall of Famer, current MLB Network analyst and friend of the program, \"The Mayor\" Sean Casey. Pat, AJ, and Sean discuss the Yankees/Nationals game and what his thoughts were after the first MLB game of the season, plus Sean shares a bunch of hilarious stories from his time in the big leagues including superstitions, conversations at first base, and his unusual routine in the box (29:47-45:15). Next, Pat is joined by 6x Pro Bowler, Philadelphia Eagles Hall of Famer and member of the Eagles' 75th anniversary team, Donovan McNabb joins the program. Pat and Donovan chat about his time in Philadelphia and the different things he looks back on and wishes he could change during his career with the Eagles, what he's been up to lately, his thoughts on the Eagles QB situation, his relationship with Andy Reid, and whether or not he and TO have made up yet (45:17-1:06:25). Lastly, Pat is joined by Tom Pelissero, Insider from the NFL Network to cover everything going on in the NFL currently as he seems to be a main point of contact for the NFL when releasing information about training camp, what the potential salary cap implications will be, and the current state of baseball as we approach the start of training camp (1:07:59-1:23:48). Don't forget to send in a picture of where you're listening to the show with the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat for the chance to win some free merch. We appreciate you all rocking with us, have a great weekend. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
