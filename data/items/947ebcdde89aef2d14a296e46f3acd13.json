It would have ensured animal rights, as well as rights to “neurodiversity” and “digital disconnection.” Ted Piccone of Brookings and the World Justice Project examines if Chile’s new constitution was too progressive or just too long. Plus, can’t we just enjoy the moment when the President went asking for a dead lady? And in the Antwentig, mo’ Skimo than you ever hoped for.\n\nProduced by Joel Patterson and Corey Wara\nEmail us at thegist@mikepesca.com\nTo advertise on the show, visit: https://advertisecast.com/TheGist\nLearn more about your ad choices.
