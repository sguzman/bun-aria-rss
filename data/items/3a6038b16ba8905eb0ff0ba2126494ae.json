  "description": "It's that time of day.  The sun is setting.  You're a little parched.  Maybe more than a little due to the fireball on the horizon.  What's just the right cocktail for the moment?  On this episode of Deep State Radio we speak with nuclear weapons specialist and amateur bartender Jeffrey Lewis about his new book \"The 2020 Commission Report on the North Korean Nuclear Attacks on the United States.\"  We discuss the current state of affairs with North Korea (good for Kim, bad for Trump...oh, and all the rest of us too) and where it may lead.  And of course, just what is the right thing to drink when you're offering up your very last toast of the day.  Of any day.
