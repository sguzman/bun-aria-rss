  "description": "<p>After years of enjoying easy one-click-shopping and personalized service from the tech giants, it’s no surprise that consumers expect similar treatment from government entities through technology. But is that a realistic request? We asked <a href= \"https://www2.deloitte.com/us/en/profiles/shurst.html\">Steve Hurst</a>, managing director in Deloitte Consulting LLP’s US Public Sector practice. He leads Deloitte’s Digital Government market offering and is responsible for helping state and local governments adopt and expand their digital capabilities.</p> <p><br /> In this episode, Steve explains which steps the government is taking to digitize government services, what that means for citizens, what costs are involved, and who will pay. Success in the digital age ultimately depends on how state governments execute end-to-end experiences, digital identity, and data sharing across the enterprise. Is the government on the road to success with this program, or will they need to forge another path? Let’s find out.</p>",
