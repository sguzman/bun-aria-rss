And you basically karma and guilt people into doing business with you.”\n\n“If you’re a winner, you’re unemotional about where you market.”\n\nThere’s only one person who would say all of that in the span of a half-hour: Gary Vaynerchuk, entrepreneur, branding expert, and serial angel investor.\n\nAnd this week on Morning Brew’s weekly podcast Business Casual, Gary V opens up about everything, from brand building (both personally and for your business) to managing an unwarranted reputation to cherry picking the next big thing in marketing. Plus...\n\nHow exactly some companies are “putting dollars in the trash”\n\nWhat the next “most underpriced asset in the world” is (hint: it’s not traded on any exchange)\n\nAnd how even the worst internet trolls add value\n\n\nSome people call Gary V an inspiration. Some people call Gary V a snake oil salesman.",
