  "title": "The Best Of Mark Levin - 10/22/22",
  "description": "This week on the Mark Levin Show, the economy is collapsing and President Biden refuses to take responsibility instead he eats ice cream. Biden worries about nothing while families struggle with fuel prices that are 40% higher. Then, abortion is much more aggressive than the Democrats who wrote Roe v Wade ever envisioned. Roe describes viability and breaks up the pregnancy into trimesters based on 'the science.' The new anti-science abortion-on-demand movement ignores the very science that Roe was based on. The election integrity legislation in Georgia is designed to make it harder to cheat and contrary to the lies in the media has nothing to do with racism. Don't allow the left to drag you into the hell that they've created. On January 6th, 2005 Democrats claimed that electronic voting machines had changed votes taking them from the Democrats and giving them to the Republicans. During President Barack Obama's terms in office Democrats lost over 1000 seats in elected office. Either of the Obama’s campaigning for Democrats will not change the trajectory of this election. Then, this program is concerned with the election denial displayed by a majority of Democrats with respect to the election of every Republican president for the past two decades. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
