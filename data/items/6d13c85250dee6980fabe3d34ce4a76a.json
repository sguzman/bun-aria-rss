No matter who you are, where you live, or your personal approach to dealing with the pandemic, there’s no denying that we’ve all been affected in some way. On today’s show, we’re going to take a comprehensive look at the root cause of this global health crisis.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p class=\"p1\">We’re diving into some important data on pharmaceutical companies and the FDA, the truth about COVID-19 reporting and outcomes, and the studies that are driving the overarching vaccine campaign in the United States. As the sickest developed nation in the world (that also happens to spend the most on medications), our citizens are undeniably susceptible to infectious diseases such as COVID-19. If we want things to change, we have to become aware, educated, and empowered.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p class=\"p1\">This episode of The Model Health Show contains important conversations on healthcare policy, education, treatments, and how our healthcare system works, and who it benefits. My intent is to have an open conversation, free from divisiveness and politics. If we can look at things rationally and objectively, that’s how we can create change.
