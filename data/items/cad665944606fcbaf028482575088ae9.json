A friend of Dale's was visiting his shop when the call came in and thought it was a woman based on the conversation.</p><p>On his way to the motorist, Dale stopped and spoke to a friend of his at a local gas station and he indicated to them what he was up to while he was out and about that day, but he never told them exactly who he was going help. This interaction is the last confirmed time anyone saw or spoke to Dale Williams.</p><p>Later, Dale’s wife called to see where her husband was.
