  "description": "<p>In early December of 2006, 32-year-old Andrew Chapman disappeared from the Hilltop area of Columbus, Ohio. At the time, Andrew lived with a couple of roommates on Whitethorne Avenue. Andrew called his mom and told her that he needed her to come by his place because he had something to give her. He seemed to be in a bit of a panic. Andrew's mom, Judy, was very ill at the time and couldn't make the trip to see Andrew that day. In the days that followed, Judy was on the mend and stopped by Andrew's apartment to see what he needed. Judy was shocked to find that Andrew's apartment had been completely cleaned out. Andrew and his roommates were gone. Phone calls to Andrew went unanswered, and no one had any clue where he could be. Andrew's case quickly went cold, and maybe he wanted some time away from family? As the years went by, more perplexing clues began to surface as Andy's sister started digging into the case herself. Today, many questions remain unanswered, but Andrew's family is determined to find out what happened to him.</p><p>If you have any information about the disappearance of Andrew Chapman, please contact the Columbus Police Department at 614-645-4545.</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href=\"http://nutrafol.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nutrafol</a>- Go to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://nutrafol.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nutrafol.com</a>&nbsp;and use promo code VANISHED to get $15 off your first order and free shipping.</p><p><a href=\"http://ritual.com/vanished\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ritual</a>- Visit&nbsp;<a href=\"http://ritual.com/Vanished\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Ritual.com/Vanished</a>&nbsp;for 10% off your first 3 months.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nuuly.com/rent/landingpage3?utm_source=Vanished&utm_medium=Podcast&utm_campaign=Spring&utm_term=Wondery&utm_content=\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nuuly</a>- Get $20 off your first month of Nuuly when you sign up at <a href=\"https://www.nuuly.com/rent/landingpage3?utm_source=Vanished&utm_medium=Podcast&utm_campaign=Spring&utm_term=Wondery&utm_content=\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Nuuly.com</a> and enter code VANISHED20.</p><p>If you have a missing loved one that you would like to have featured on the show, please fill out our <a href=\"http://www.thevanishedpodcast.com/case-submission/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">case submission form</a>.</p><p>Follow The Vanished on social media at:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thevanishedpodcast/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thevanishedpodcast/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/thevanishedpod/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/thevanishedpodcast\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Patreon</a></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
