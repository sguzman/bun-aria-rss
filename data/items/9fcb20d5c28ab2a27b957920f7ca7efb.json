  "description": "<p>To be a photographer is to grow. Photography is as much a technical skill as it is a creative escape yet we fall hard in the trap of how much gear matters and how important certain aspects of photography are that we get lost and have a hard time finding out own path which leads to losing the creativity. Today I break down the 3 biggest lessons you need to learn in 2020 to grow as a photographer.</p><p><b>Lesson 1: The Gear Does Not Matter</b></p><p>When building the fundamentals it does not matter if you use a $25 camera or a $2500 camera. Your results will look the same. I would argue that the more you limit yourself when getting started the stronger the photographer you will be later on. You can see examples of my iPhone 3G camera photos below. Use what you have to Make more.</p><p><b>Lesson 2: There Is No Competition</b></p><p>Competition seems everywhere. Coke v. Pepsi - AT&T v. Verizon - Ferrari v. Lamborghini. Sure each of these companies offer the same thing but they are all unique in the way they do it. There are a million other photographers out there, but some stand out, why? Because they are different, they don’t keep up with everyone else, they follow their passions and explore their creativity to create unique pieces. Don’t worry about others, do what feels right to you.</p><p><b>Lesson 3: You Don’t Have To Be An Expert to Start</b></p><p>An expert is someone with the knowledge and know how to create something in just about any situation. That knowledge and know how comes from experience. You don’t gain experience unless you actually do something, practice. You have more access to gear with whats in your pocket than ANYONE just 20 years ago. Make what you have work to gain the experience and grow into the photographer you want to be.</p><p> </p><p><figure data-trix-attachment='{\"contentType\":\"image\",\"height\":800,\"url\":\"https://static1.squarespace.com/static/569aeb57fd5d084e149e5469/t/5dfb7accf8effb79c8bc19fb/1576762065669/IMG_0138.JPG?format=1500w\",\"width\":600}' data-trix-content-type='image' class='attachment attachment--preview'><img src='https://static1.squarespace.com/static/569aeb57fd5d084e149e5469/t/5dfb7accf8effb79c8bc19fb/1576762065669/IMG_0138.JPG?format=1500w' width='600' height='800'/><figcaption class='attachment__caption'></figcaption></figure></p><p>Grab your Free CloudSpot Account at <a href=\"http://deliverphotos.com/\">DeliverPhotos.com</a></p> <p>Grab your Free CloudSpot Account at <a href=\"http://deliverphotos.com/\">DeliverPhotos.com</a></p>",
