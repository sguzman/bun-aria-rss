  "description": "<p>The Supreme Court has ruled that the state of Maine cannot exclude private schools from its voucher program simply because they are religious. David French explains the ruling and how it fits into decades of pro-religious liberty wins. Skye Jethani asks how the courts define “religion” and why secular philosophy has an unfair advantage in public schools. Then, the January 6th hearings are revealing how people within Trump’s party and administration thwarted his attempts to reverse the outcome of the election. They’ve testified about his lies and his illegal actions. So why do so many of them say they’ll still vote for him in 2024? French and Jethani discuss how the GOP can move on from Donald Trump, why that’s unlikely, and the challenges facing both parties in the next election.</p> <p>0:00 - Intro<br /> 00:38 - Carson v.
