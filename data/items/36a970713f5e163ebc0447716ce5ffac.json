  "description": "<p class=\"\">This week we’re reading a favorite of both Sarah & Jen — Stephanie Laurens’s Devil’s Bride! We’re so excited to talk about ridiculous (we mean amazing) nicknames, about 30 page sex scenes, and about how we crushed our SATs thanks to romances like this one! We’re also hoping you are keeping a safe distance from others and washing your hands lots!</p><p class=\"\">We love having you with us! — subscribe on your favorite podcasting platform and like/review the podcast, please!</p><p class=\"\">Next week, we’re reading Susan Elizabeth Phillips’s Nobody’s Baby But Mine, and we cannot WAIT.

She still swears she didn't read any of them.</p><p class=\"\"><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3b5zheu\">Captain Jack's Woman</a> was Stephanie Laurens' debut novel, not Devil's Bride.

Sarah can't always have eyes on her, sorry.</p><p class=\"\">Jen thinks it was <a href=\"https://amzn.to/38XL7pv\">Amanda Quick</a> that brought back old-fashioned names, but the only truly great <a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/music/2018/jul/06/what-a-star-he-would-be-today-the-extraordinary-musical-legacy-of-sylvester\">Sylvester</a>is from disco.</p><p class=\"\">\"<a href=\"https://dictionary.cambridge.org/us/dictionary/english/eyes-out-on-stalks\">Eyes on stalks</a>\" is a real phrase, and so is <a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/rapacious\">rapaciously</a>.
