  "description": "Grief is a long-misunderstood experience that many people believe proceeds according to predictable steps ending in ‘closure.’ According to Hope Edelman, however, grief is a long-term process that can actually enhance rather than constrict our lives. She debunks many myths about grief and loss in her new book, The AfterGrief: Finding Your Way Along the Long Arc of Loss (Ballantine Books, 2020). In our candid interview, she opens up about how the loss of her mother 40 years ago still teaches her lessons today, and she explains how we all might benefit from rethinking the way we grieve and heal from loss. This episode will be timely and relevant for anyone who feels ‘stuck’ following a loss and is searching for a new way to move forward.\nHope Edelman is the author of eight nonfiction books, including bestsellers Motherless Daughters and Motherless Mothers and the memoir The Possibility of Everything. Her original essays have appeared in many anthologies, including The Bitch in the House, Behind the Bedroom Door, and Goodbye to All That. Motherless Daughters was named a New York Times Notable Book of the year, and Edelman’s work has also won her a Pushcart Prize for creative nonfiction. The recipient of the 2020 Community Educator Award from the Association for Death Education and Counseling, she is a certified Martha Beck Life Coach and facilitates Motherless Daughters retreats and workshops all over the world. She lives and works in Los Angeles and Iowa City.\nEugenio Duarte, Ph.D. is a psychologist and psychoanalyst practicing in Miami. He treats individuals and couples, with specialties in gender and sexuality, eating and body image problems, and relationship issues. He is a graduate and faculty of William Alanson White Institute in Psychiatry, Psychoanalysis, and Psychology in New York City and former chair of their LGBTQ Study Group; and faculty at Florida Psychoanalytic Institute in Miami. He is also a contributing author to the book Introduction to Contemporary Psychoanalysis: Defining Terms and Building Bridges (2018, Routledge) and has published on issues of gender, sexuality, and sexual abuse.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
