  "description": "Adam and Dr. Drew open the show discussing Adam's recent interview with neuroscientist Andrew Huberman. They also discuss a recent guest that Drew had on his show who went through a heart transplant as a somewhat young man and discuss the need to find and listen to good sources while being careful to look out for narratives. They also take a trip down memory lane and review some of the exchanges from early in the pandemic to see how they've aged. As the show winds down they turn to the phones and speak to callers of topics from intermittent fasting to crime in LA and more.\n\nThanks For Supporting Today's Sponsors:\nFastGrowingTrees.com/ADS\nTenThousand.cc Promo Code ADS\nLifeLock.com Promo Code ADAM\nGeico.com\nPluto.TV",
