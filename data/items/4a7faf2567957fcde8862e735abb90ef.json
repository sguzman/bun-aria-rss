if you are a non-fiction writer</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Go for ProWritingAid if you are a fiction writer.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">ProWritingAid is better at catching errors found in long-form content. However, Grammarly is more suited to short blog posts and other similar tasks.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">ProWritingAid helps you clean up your writing by checking for style, structure, and content while Grammarly focuses on grammar and punctuation.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Grammarly has a more friendly UI/UX whereas; ProWritingAid offers complete feedback on big picture writing.</span></li></ul><p></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Both ProWritingAid and Grammarly are awesome writing tools, without a doubt. but as per my experience, Grammarly is a winner here because Grammarly helps you to review and edit your content. Grammarly highlights all the mistakes in your writing within seconds of copying and pasting the content into Grammarly’s editor or using the software’s native feature in other text editors.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Not only does it identify tiny grammatical and spelling errors, it tells you when you overlook punctuations where they are needed. And, beyond its plagiarism-checking capabilities, Grammarly helps you proofread your content. Even better, the software offers a free plan that gives you access to some of its features.</span></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>",
