if you are a non-fiction writer</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Go for ProWritingAid if you are a fiction writer.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">ProWritingAid is better at catching errors found in long-form content. However, Grammarly is more suited to short blog posts and other similar tasks.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">ProWritingAid helps you clean up your writing by checking for style, structure, and content while Grammarly focuses on grammar and punctuation.</span></li><li><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Grammarly has a more friendly UI/UX whereas; ProWritingAid offers complete feedback on big picture writing.</span></li></ul><p></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Both ProWritingAid and Grammarly are awesome writing tools, without a doubt. but as per my experience, Grammarly is a winner here because Grammarly helps you to review and edit your content. Grammarly highlights all the mistakes in your writing within seconds of copying and pasting the content into Grammarlyâ€™s editor or using the softwareâ€™s native feature in other text editors.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Not only does it identify tiny grammatical and spelling errors, it tells you when you overlook punctuations where they are needed. And, beyond its plagiarism-checking capabilities, Grammarly helps you proofread your content. Even better, the software offers a free plan that gives you access to some of its features.</span></p><p><br /></p><p><br /></p>",
