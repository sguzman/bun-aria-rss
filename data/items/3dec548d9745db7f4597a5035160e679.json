  "description": "Leila Janah didn’t have the money to start her company, but she didn’t let that hold her back. She paid her way through Harvard by cleaning toilets, serving cocktails, and tutoring wealthy students while pitching her sustainable business model to anyone who would listen. Since the inception of her company, Samasource--named as one of Fast Company's most innovative companies in 2016--Leila has employed nearly 10,000 people and helped nearly 35,000 people permanently move above the poverty line. Her customers are some of the world’s biggest companies such as Google, Microsoft, Walmart, eBay and she’s been profiled in The New York Times, WIRED, Forbes, and Inc. Leila also founded LXMI (pronounced luxe-me) which is the first social impact beauty brand to be sold at Sephora. Meet the founder, author, and social entrepreneur who believes in reversing poverty one job at a time in this episode of Impact Theory with Tom Bilyeu.
