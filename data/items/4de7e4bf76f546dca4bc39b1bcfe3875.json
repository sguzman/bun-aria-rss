  "description": "<p>On today’s Dan Patrick Show, DP and the guys gear up for a full weekend of college basketball as the NCAA Tournament’s first round tips off this afternoon. However, much of the sports spotlight remains on Deshaun Watson and the allegations that swirl around him. NBC Sports’ Peter King joined the show in the first hour to discuss the latest on that as well as what the Jets may do with their second pick. Dan gets the local reaction to the Watson news when he talked to Houston sports talk radio host Sean Salisbury. Simply put, the mood around Houston is gut-wrenching on the news, especially from a person who was one of the most liked athletes in the city. Lastly, as the tournament begins today, Jim Jackson joined the show in the final hour to talk about which top seed is the most vulnerable, along with other story lines across the first weekend of the NCAA Tournament.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
