  "description": "On Tuesday’s Mark Levin Show, Brian Mudd of WJNO fills in for Mark. The next election cycle has already begun, and if we’re going to get new election systems in place we need to start today. Demanding a paper ballot trail, removing corrupted systems like Sequoia, and holding local officials accountable will drive the change. If it can be done in Democrat strongholds like Broward and Palm Beach Counties in 2018, it can be done anywhere. President Trump was the beginning of the end of the establishment, and now we decide if we want to continue the fight. The Georgia senate runoff election needs as much transparency and attention to make it impossible to steal. We will accept results if they are honest and fair, but we’re upset because we don’t have honest and fair elections anymore. Also, Chuck Schumer said the fastest way to help Americans is to give them their money back. A better relief would be if they didn’t collect the tax to begin with. The best way to help Americans isn’t bailout packages, tax cuts are.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
