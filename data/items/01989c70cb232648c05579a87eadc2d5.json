  "description": "<p>EPISODE 95 - EMMA PILL - Location Manager</p> <p>Team Deakins sits down with Location Manager extraordinaire Emma Pill (1917, SPECTRE, INCEPTION, THE BOURNE ULTIMATUM). In this episode, we learn lots about the function of the location department and the importance of their role. She tells us she sees her job as walking a tight rope between the production world and the real world and how she learned early how important it is to be honest with the owners of locations who often don’t know what the reality of having a film crew in their home or building will be like. We learn about the importance of coming up with solutions to locations with logistical problems, how she became an expert on Moroccan locations, how she deals with schedule changes, and the importance of having a signed contract for the location. She also goes into the details of being the location manager on Bourne Ultimatum, Blade Runner 2049, and 1917. A great deep dive into the role of Location Manager!</p>",
