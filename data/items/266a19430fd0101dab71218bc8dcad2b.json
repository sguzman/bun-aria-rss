  "title": "49: From Little Mac McClellan to Stonewall Jackson: The Peninsula and Shenandoah Valley Campaigns",
  "description": "“In my opinion, Cadet Jackson of Virginia is a complete jackass.”\n\nThis is the story of daring. On both sides.\n\nPresident Lincoln is tired of waiting for General-in-Chief George “Little Mac” McClellan to act. So he’ll act instead. The President goes to the front on the Old Dominion’s coast, walks on Confederate soil, and oversees the taking of Norfolk, Virginia. \n\nBut things aren’t going as well for the Union as he’d hope. Little Mac continues to dawdle while the eccentric-yet-brilliant “Stonewall” Jackson outwits, outruns, and outguns Union forces several times larger than his own in the Shenandoah Valley.\n\nFollowing Stonewall’s incredible Shenandoah Valley Campaign, Confederate General Joe Johnston takes a bullet at the Battle of Seven Pines. Someone else is going to have to lead his army; welcome to the role of commander, Robert E. Lee.\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
