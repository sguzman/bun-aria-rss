  "description": "<p>The new tax law nearly doubles the standard deduction which means even fewer folks will be itemizing deductions on their tax returns this year- however, there is still an important way to massively cut our tax bills! Regardless of whether we take the standard deduction or if we itemize deductions- we can still reduce our tax bill by ‘above the line deductions’. These are technically not actual deductions but adjustments to arrive at our adjusted gross income which we typically want as low as possible in order to pay fewer taxes! Listen as we cover some of the best ways to cut our tax bills and why you’ll likely want to do the same.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Karate in the Garage by Southern Swells which you can find and learn all about on Untappd. A massive thanks to Kate from Southern Swells for sending us a bunch of their beers- we’re big fans of what they’re doing down at Jax beach!
