Leaning on the rustic experiences of her Midwestern upbringing (she was making mushroom tea long before Four Sigmatic was a thing), Iliana pioneered a unique locavore style of cooking dubbed 'new gatherer', plied daily at her Chicago restaurant&nbsp;<em>Elizabeth</em>&nbsp;-- notable for its homestead aesthetic, emphasis on foraged foods and deep connection to the natural surroundings.</p><p>It's an approach that landed her a coveted Michelin star&nbsp;<em>six years in a row.</em>&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bit.ly/richroll453\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jeff Gordinier</a>, food and drinks editor for Esquire magazine (<a href=\"http://bit.ly/richroll453\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">and&nbsp;former podcast guest</a>), included Elizabeth on&nbsp;his recent list&nbsp;of the last decade’s 40 most important restaurants. Noma's René Redzepi, arguably the world's greatest chef, counts himself a fan. And David Chang dubs Iliana one of the best chefs he has ever known.</p><p>This past summer Iliana published&nbsp;<em>Burn The Place.&nbsp;</em>A singular, powerfully expressive debut memoir, her story is raw like that first bite of wild onion, alive with startling imagery, and told with uncommon emotional power.&nbsp;<em>The New York Times</em>&nbsp;describes the book as, “perhaps the definitive Midwestern drunken-lesbian food memoir.”&nbsp;<em>The New Yorker&nbsp;</em>echoes this sentiment, calling it \"brutal and luminous\"; and “a thrilling, disquieting memoir of addiction and coming of age.” Oh yeah, it's also the first food book to be long-listed for the National Book Award since Julia Child in 1980.</p><p>Now 10 years sober, Iliana’s passion has made an unlikely turn. Focused not in the predictable direction of building a culinary empire, her sights are instead set on a remote corner of Michigan’s Upper Peninsula. Deep in the Hiawatha National Forest, Iliana, alongside her wife Anna and three dogs, has converted a cabin on 150 acres into&nbsp;<em>Milkweed Inn</em>&nbsp;-- a bed and breakfast where she serves up her trademark 'new gatherer' cuisine to small groups of just 10 people over weekends between May and October.</p><p>Today Iliana shares her story.</p><p>It's a deeply personal conversation about her love of food, foraging and the great outdoors.</p><p>It’s about identity and sexual politics.
