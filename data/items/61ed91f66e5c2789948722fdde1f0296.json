  "description": "<p>We present the growth and basic magnetic and transport properties of\nCr$_{1+x}$Pt$_{5-x}$P. We show that single crystals can readily be grown from a\nhigh-temperature solution created by adding dilute quantities of Cr to Pt-P\nbased melts. Like other 1-5-1 compounds, Cr$_{1+x}$Pt$_{5-x}$P adopts a\ntetragonal P4/mmm structure composed face-sharing CrPt$_3$ like slabs that are\nbroken up along the c-axis by sheets of P atoms. EDS and X-ray diffraction\nmeasurements both suggest Cr$_{1+x}$Pt$_{5-x}$P has mixed occupancy between Cr\nand Pt atoms, similar to what is found in the closely related compound\nCrPt$_3$, giving real compositions of Cr$_{1.5}$Pt$_{4.5}$P (x = 0.5). We\nreport that Cr$_{1.5}$Pt$_{4.5}$P orders ferromagnetically at T$_C$ = 464.5 K\nwith a saturated moment of $\\approx$ 2.1 $\\mu_{\\textit{B}}$/Cr at 1.8 K. Likely\nowing to the strong spin-orbit coupling associated with the large quantity of\nhigh Z Pt atoms, Cr$_{1.5}$Pt$_{4.5}$P has exceptionally strong planar\nanisotropy with estimated anisotropy fields of 345 kOe and 220 kOe at 1.8 K and\n300 K respectively. The resistance of Cr$_{1.5}$Pt$_{4.5}$P has a metallic\ntemperature dependence with relatively weak magnetoresistance. Electronic band\nstructure calculations show that CrPt$_5$P has a large peak in the density of\nstates near the Fermi level which is split into spin majority and minority\nbands in the ferromagnetic state. Furthermore, the calculations suggest\nsubstantial hybridization between Cr-3d and Pt-5d states near the Fermi level,\nin agreement with the experimentally measured anisotropy.\n</p>",
