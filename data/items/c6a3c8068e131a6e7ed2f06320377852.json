Released in April 2013 for Microsoft Windows, PlayStation 3 and Xbox 360, Riptide serves as a continuation of the story to 2011's Dead Island, with the original four survivors, plus a new survivor, arriving on another island in the Banoi archipelago, which has also been overrun by zombies.\n\nDead Island: Riptide received a mixed reception from critics, who cited that the game did not fix any of its predecessor's problems, nor add anything new to the gameplay. A third title and first official sequel for the series, Dead Island 2, was revealed at E3 2014. It was originally set for a 2016 release; however, the game entered development hell after the project was moved over from Yager Development to Sumo Digital in 2016. The development of Dead Island 2 changed hands again in 2019, this time to an internal studio of Deep Silver, Dambuster Studios. The game is now scheduled for release on February 3, 2023. Along with the first game, Riptide was released for PlayStation 4, Xbox One, Windows, and SteamOS under the title Dead Island: Definitive Edition.\n\n#gaming #jayvee #deadisland",
