  "description": "<p>Aron Ralston is an avid outdoorsman, author, and motivational speaker. In April of 2003, he dislodged a boulder while descending a slot canyon at Blue John Canyon, in Eastern Wayne County, Utah, crushing his hand and pinning it against a canyon wall. After five days of entrapment with little water and food, Aron resorted to amputating his arm in order to free himself. The incident is documented in his autobiographical memoir Between a Rock and a Hard Place and is the subject of the Oscar-nominated film 127 Hours, directed by Danny Boyle, and starring James Franco.</p> <p>Aron's <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/captainfunhog/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/RalstonSpeaks\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Twitter</a>, <a href=\"http://aronralstonadventure.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">web site</a>.</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find me on</span> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thatchrisryan/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instagram</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or</span> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThatChrisRyan\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twitter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/tangentiallyspeaking\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Please consider supporting this podcast on Patreon.</span></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/site-directory/ref=as_at/?imprToken=L0dx1bytKTIFKxXSPyxqDw&slotNum=0&imprToken=9z4hfRiNxmPSo-xbL1UP9w&slotNum=23&&_encoding=UTF8&tag=seatda-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=f16530c77f77aa7b0fbec39c58a049a1&camp=1789&creative=9325\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">This Amazon affiliate link kicks a few bucks back my way.</span></a></p> <br/><br/>This is a public episode.
