  "description": "Today on The Gist, Mike Pesca is joined by Kid Fury and Crissle, the hosts of The Read podcast. They are best known for their “reads,” a term with roots in the 1980s black gay community. A read is an honest, Spiel-like venting with a purpose, and makes for great listening. For the Spiel, Mike Pesca remembers his friend Bobby Lichman, who lived his life with brilliance, intensity, and conviction. Bobby performed under the name Bobby Sichran, and today’s show features music from his album From a Sympathetical Hurricane.\n \nToday’s sponsor: The Jinx: The Life and Deaths of Robert Durst, the new documentary series from HBO. It airs Sundays at 8 p.m. only on HBO.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
