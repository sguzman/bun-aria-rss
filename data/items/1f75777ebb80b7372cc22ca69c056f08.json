  "description": "<p>This month is on NFT. We chatted about the economics of NFT, and the economics of NFT flipping last week. A few days ago, an art piece was sold at $69 million by Beeple (https://onlineonly.christies.com/s/first-open-beeple/beeple-b-1981-1/112924)! Of which, $9m is in fees. My mistake, that $9m is to Christie and not the network's transaction.</p>\n<p>In any case, transaction fees are still a problem. Not only is it expensive to buy an NFT (we mentioned this 2 weeks ago), but also expensive to MINT NFT. That might be causing the huge inflation in prices, since the fixed cost to mint the NFT is already high.</p>\n<p>Hence, I want to talk about Polygon ($Matic) today. Up to now, when the bottlenecks of the Ethereum network have not been fully resolved, Layer 2 solutions are showing their remarkable advantages. Formerly #Matic Network, #Polygon has great ambitions to deploy all Layer 2 solutions on themselves.</p>\n<p>NFTs are moving to Polygon because it is cheaper and faster. Also, the level of security on Layer 1 of Ethereum is good but not a necessary function. In this episode, we look at the 4 layers of Polygon and understand the quick dive into the token design!</p>\n<p>Donate here: <a href=\"https://gitcoin.co/grants/2054/economics-design-education\">https://gitcoin.co/grants/2054/economics-design-education</a></p>\n",
