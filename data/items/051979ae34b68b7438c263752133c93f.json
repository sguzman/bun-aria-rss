  "description": "Coronavirus could change America forever, but it’s time to prepare, not panic. The stock market continues to drop and people are getting the virus again in China, but a vaccine will almost certainly come from the U.S. or Israel. And a former Obama adviser argues that the Democratic Party – NOT the voters – will choose its candidate. But will the Bernie Bros let that go, or will they act more like “Bernie Bolsheviks”? Bill O’Reilly joins for a Friday full of coronavirus chaos to reinforce that now is a time for caution, not panic. And is 2020 the year when our two-party system fractures into tribes? Glenn gives some coronavirus predictions to watch out for and premieres new theme music for the Democratic candidates.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
