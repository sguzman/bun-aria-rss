  "description": "<p>Today I start a new series on the Beginner Photography Podcast with past podcast guest, destination wedding photographer Matt Druin. Matt approached me with the idea of having a segment where just 2 wedding photographers are just talking about an aspect of photography. This is our first attempt and hopefully you enjoy it.  In this episode we talk about Gear! Every new photographers favorite subject and yet its arguably one of the least important. We talk about knowing when to buy what photography gear. We talk about renting your camera gear vs buying it.
