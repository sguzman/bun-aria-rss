  "description": "John Christie. March 31, 1953. 10 Rillington Place, Notting Hill, London. A serial killer operates under the guise of being helpful. Luring women into his place under the pretext of an intent to cure them of an illness or to perform abortions, he would render them unconscious with coal gas before raping and strangling them. Among his known eight victims was his own wife, Ethel. Despite the warning signs, he was able to do this for a decade before he made a serious error and his evil deeds began to come to light. The victims of John Christie would be found both inside and outside his home. With that, a terrible truth was revealed about a man that Christie had testified against in court a few years earlier. A man who was later put to death for murdering his daughter and suspected of killing his own wife. \n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
