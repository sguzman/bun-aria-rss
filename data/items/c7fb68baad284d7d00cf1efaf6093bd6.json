  "description": "<p>As you make the meals, change the diapers, settle the arguments, and fold the laundry day after day, do you ever wonder if any of it really matters? With so many immediate needs in front of us, it can be easy to lose sight of our eternal purpose. In this episode, Emily and Laura discuss some simple (yet profound) truths that help clarify our destination and goal as believers in Christ. When we remember that we’re being conformed to the image of Jesus and one day we’ll dwell with him for eternity, we can hold things loosely in this life and embrace our role as servants doing the Master’s work—even if it’s the same work day after day.</p> <p>We’re grateful to Harvest House Publishers for making this week’s show possible.
