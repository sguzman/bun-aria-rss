  "description": "Rethinking Sin & Salvation. This episode is meaty. We start out by answering two questions that were sent in, dealing with different elements that have been discussed in this series:\n\nOn the topic of disagreeing over mask wearing, sometimes vehemently: How do we hold people in both love and accountability?\n\nAnd then, how do we lead worship(and worship in general)within this understanding of new creation and the sermon on the mount?\n\nThen we sink into the meat of this series... What is sin? Is it more than we've been fed over the years, as individual moral transgressions that anger a fickle God? What is the human vocation? How does sin effect us and our journey with God? What is wrath in this conversation? What is salvation? What are we saved from? What are we saved to? How do old creation dynamics play into this and what is the relationship with new creation dynamics?\n\nThis is a lot and gave Tim oatmeal brain for awhile after.\n\nAs always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue. Always feel free to email in questions to hello@voxpodcast.com, and to engage the conversation on here and Instagram. \n\nLearn more about the VOX Podcast:\nVoxpodcast.com\n\nSubscribe on iTunes - apple.co/1Lla1Nj\n\nSupport the VOX Podcast on Patreon:\nwww.patreon.com/voxpodcast\n\nFollow us on Instagram: @voxpodcast\nLike us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/voxpodcast\nFollow Mike on Twitter: www.twitter.com/mikeerre\n\nMusic in this episode by Timothy John Stafford\nwww.timothyjohnstafford.com\nInstagram & Twitter: @GoneTimothy\n",
