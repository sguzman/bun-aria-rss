  "title": "NFC South Offseason Priorities: Biggest Team Needs for Falcons, Panthers, Saints & Bucs (Football 3/4)",
  "description": "Our offseason priority series continues with a focus on the NFC South. Will Brinson and Tyler Sullivan break down the needs of the Falcons (:20), Panthers (15:20), Saints (26:45) and Bucs (39:00). Atlanta has a  high pick which causes them at least to consider the future of Matt Ryan. Carolina seems firmly in the Deshaun Watson sweepstakes, so how will that impact the rest of their offseason approach? New Orleans is a mystery. We thought it was a guarantee that Drew Brees would retire, but there's at least some doubts now. And Tampa...They are the champs but also have areas of concern with several key free agents set to hit the market. Who will they retain and who will they let walk?\n**Note: There was a slight technical issue at the beginning of the episode so we jump right into the NFC South conversation! It was to good to be true that Brinson was THAT to the point. \n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nYou can listen to Pick Six on your smart speakers!
