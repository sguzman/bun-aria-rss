  "title": "What's happened to gay rights since Stonewall?",
  "description": "Fifty years ago, when gay protesters clashed with New York City police outside a nondescript bar, the Stonewall Inn, few expected it to become one of the turning points in the gay rights movements in the world. But the encounter motivated and galvanized a generation of gay men and women who demanded to be accepted in society for who they were. Change came slowly and same sex marriage and equal protection under law now exists in many countries. But huge challenges remain and, according to one survey, a large number of gay men and women still struggle to come out. This week, fifty years on from 'Stonewall', The Real Story hears about the most pressing issues for LGBT communities. Celia Hatton is joined by a global panel of LGBT activists to discuss the impact of those 1969  riots and the state of progress for gay rights movements across the world.\n\n(Photo: People participate in the annual LA Pride Parade in West Hollywood, California, on June 9, 2019.
