  "description": "<p>As Jenna and Angela prepare for Season 5 of The Office, Office Ladies takes a look back at Grief Counseling. This episode starts off with some real life bird trouble, and we get some special audio treats from Mindy Kaling and the episode writer herself, Jen Celotta. Then we dig into chip rankings, we clear up a fan theory around Ed Truck’s death, and we find out who’s been moving the conference table. Finally, we get a writer’s room deep dive on Dwight’s absorbed twin speech, and Jenna learns to not touch melons in France. Amen!</p>\n<p>Audio excerpt courtesy Penguin Random House Audio from Is Everyone Hanging Out Without Me? (And Other Concerns) by Mindy Kaling, narrated by the author. © 2011 by Mindy Kaling, ℗ 2011 Penguin Random House LLC</p>\n",
