  "description": "<p>25-year-old Nicole Sinkule slept while her boyfriend plotted to kill her. Eric Marum hit her with a claw hammer more than a dozen times. Marum pled guilty and received a sentence of 16 years to life in prison. In November, two members of the California Board of Parole granted him a recommendation for parole. One member voted against parole. Now Nicole's parents are asking Governor Gavin Newsom to deny the recommendation. Newsom has three options. If he takes no action, Marum will be released. If Newson reverses the decision, Marcum will receive another hearing in 18 months. The last option is to refer the decision back to the board for the members to modify their decision. The Sinkules have also started a petition to reverse the parole recommendation.</p><p>Joining Nancy Grace Today:</p><ul>\n<li>Glenn Sinkule - Victim's Father, The Nicole Sinkule Foundation, www.nicolesinkule.org</li>\n<li>Claudia Sinkule - Victim's Mother</li>\n<li>Danetta Sinkule - Victim's Sister</li>\n<li>John Cross - Supervising Deputy District Attorney - Lifer Hearing Unit Office</li>\n<li>Dr. Shari Schwartz - Forensic Psychologist (specializing in Capital Mitigation and Victim Advocacy), www.panthermitigation.com, Twitter: https://twitter.com/TrialDoc, Author: \"Criminal Behavior\" and \"Where Law and Psychology Intersect\"</li>\n<li>Katherine Maloney, M.D. - Deputy Chief Medical Examiner, Erie County Medical Examiners Office, (Buffalo NY), www.nickelcityforensics.com</li>\n<li>Sergeant Keli Garcia - Oceanside Police Department, www.ci.oceanside.ca.us/gov/police, Instagram: @OceansidePD, Twitter: @OceansidePD</li>\n<li>Samantha Lomibao - Reporter, KESQ News 3</li>\n</ul><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
