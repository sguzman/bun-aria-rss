  "description": "<p>Most organizations start, grow, thrive, lose momentum, decline… and eventually end. The same is true for most churches.</p> <p>In our new series, “Ask This, Not That,” we're exploring the seven phases of the church lifecycle: launch, momentum growth, strategic growth, sustained health, maintenance, preservation, and life support. This week, we'll unpack the first three phases and discuss the questions many church leaders <em>are</em> asking in these seasons versus the questions they <em>should be</em> asking.</p> <p>For the full episode transcript, links mentioned during the show, and to download the Leader Conversation Guide, visit this episode's <strong>Show Notes</strong> at <strong><a href= \"https://tonymorganlive.com/2021/06/23/the-growing-side-of-the-church-lifecycle-episode-198-the-unstuck-church-podcast/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">theunstuckgroup.com/episode198</a>.</strong></p> <p><em><strong>Join the Live Conversation on Social Media</strong></em></p> <p>If you're listening on Wednesday, when the episode first releases, join the live conversation The Unstuck Group's team will be having on social media about this week's topic.
