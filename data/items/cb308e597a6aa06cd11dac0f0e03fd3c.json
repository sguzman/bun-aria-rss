  "title": "PMS 2.0 212 - Metta World Peace, Kevin Youkilis, AFL Stud Mason Cox, & Legend, AJ Hawk Stop By For A MASSIVE Thursday",
  "description": "Today's show is headlined by a couple more great interviews. First, 2x World Series Champion, 3x All-Star, Gold Glover, and member of the Boston Red Sox Hall of Fame, Kevin Youkilis joins the program. Pat and Youk chat about his career and how he landed on his unique batting stance, why a 48 game season isn't really baseball in his opinion and why he thinks most players will agree, his thoughts on the Houston Astros cheating scandal, and what it was like playing for the Yankees after playing for the Red Sox for almost his entire career (:45-25:33). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk where Pat and AJ discuss what's going on in the MLB, Fight Island being a sure thing and how they think it is going to be received, their thoughts on the Netflix Garth Brooks documentary, and everything else that is happening around the sports world (26:57-1:37:45). Later, NBA Champion, NBA Defensive Player of the Year, All-Star, and 4x All-NBA Defensive team, one of the most interesting men on the planet, Metta World Peace joins the program. Pat and Metta chat about his thoughts on the protests and what that whole experience has been like for him, he recounts his time in Indiana and the Malice at the Palace, he looks back on a few of the regrets in his career, his time playing with Kobe, and what he thinks about the NBA tournament that is going to finish out this season in one of the most introspective and thoughtful conversations we've ever had (1:40:30-2:03:22). Lastly, former Oklahoma State basketball player, and current Ruckman/Forward for the Collingwood Magpies of the AFL (Aussie Rules Football), friend of the program, Mason \"Coxzilla\" Cox joins the show. Pat and Mason chat about the AFL returning (this morning), why he thinks the AFL will catch on with NFL fans, what some potential bets to keep in mind are, who some of the toughest teams in the league this year will be, how Australia is dealing with the coronavirus right now, and why he's hoping to be back from injury very soon in an incredible conversation (2:06:33-2:27:57). Don't forget to send in the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat with a picture of where you're listening to the show for the chance to win some free merch. We appreciate you rocking with us. Come and laugh with us, cheers.\n",
