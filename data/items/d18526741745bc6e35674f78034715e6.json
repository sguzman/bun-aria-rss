Initially translating between English and Arabic only, we now translate 30 trillion sentences per year across 103 languages.</p><p>Google Translate has become an essential tool for communicating across languages, and we recently redesigned the <a href=\"https://translate.google.com/\">Translate website</a> to make it easier to use. Here’s what you need to know:</p><ul><li>The site’s new look is now consistent with other Google products, and updated labeling and typography make it easier to navigate. For instance, you’ve always been able to upload documents for translation, but now that feature is easier to find. </li><li>Now it’s even more convenient to save and organize important translations you regularly utilize or search for. We’ve added labels to each saved translation, so if you speak multiple languages, you can sort and group your translations with a single click.</li><li>We've made the website responsive so it can adjust dynamically for your screen size. So when we launch new features, you get a great web experience across all your devices: mobile, tablet, or desktop. <br/></li></ul></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"h-c-page\"><div class=\"article-image__is-caption h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3 h-c-grid__col--offset-2\"><a class=\"article-image--link\"><img alt=\"translate web redesign gif\" class=\"article-image--large\" src=\" https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/blog-gif.gif \" tabindex=\"0\"/></a></div><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption article-image__is-caption-image h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>The new responsive website adjusts dynamically to your screen size.</p></div></figcaption></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p>To check out the new site, visit <a href=\"http://translate.google.com\">translate.google.com</a>.</p></div></div></body></html>",
