  "description": "<p>A large number of studies, all using Bayesian parameter inference from Markov\nChain Monte Carlo methods, have constrained the presence of a decaying dark\nmatter component. All such studies find a strong preference for either very\nlong-lived or very short-lived dark matter. However, in this letter, we\ndemonstrate that this preference is due to parameter volume effects that drive\nthe model towards the standard $\\Lambda$CDM model, which is known to provide a\ngood fit to most observational data.\n</p>\n<p>Using profile likelihoods, which are free from volume effects, we instead\nfind that the best-fitting parameters are associated with an intermediate\nregime where around $3 \\%$ of cold dark matter decays just prior to\nrecombination. With two additional parameters, the model yields an overall\npreference over the $\\Lambda$CDM model of $\\Delta \\chi^2 \\approx -2.8$ with\n\\textit{Planck} and BAO and $\\Delta \\chi^2 \\approx -7.8$ with the SH0ES $H_0$\nmeasurement, while only slightly alleviating the $H_0$ tension. Ultimately, our\nresults reveal that decaying dark matter is more viable than previously\nassumed, and illustrate the dangers of relying exclusively on Bayesian\nparameter inference when analysing extensions to the $\\Lambda$CDM model.\n</p>",
