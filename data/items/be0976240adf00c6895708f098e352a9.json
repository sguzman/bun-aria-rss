Some still recall the cruelty of the nuns. Others were adopted to America and are only now discovering relations in Ireland and the UK. Through the personal narratives of survivors, adoptees, and the women who pieced together the evidence that has shaken Ireland to its core, leading to an unprecedented apology from the Irish State,&nbsp;<em>The Missing Children</em>&nbsp;uncovers the truth of a shocking story which continues to affect the lives of many in Ireland, the US and the UK.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>The Missing Children is on Topic, which is available to US and Canadian audiences on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://trk.klclick.com/ls/click?upn=qvmkG2jxH8eVvxO16sykUwoeQe1P26VqiaKg0sme4McX5ZoR6e6veXzIIQoeHcmzMQ80c1iovNXBMVMP8CHlUYjCK29r-2BaLteNAf-2FdGTesguJDS3mz3NkEOCzKv9aHsBCOVflfZjfxoS8qwZ-2BtX1RPjIyPAMzNv04UQ8TYyVbO2F4z7E7ygYfggTC3XxrZ9MntOcMLE94HUv80y0Ng4TCU8ZbVfAWwtFGxxNmDQIPosy9JmDWT0O8SR9Jvp6YiiKMPWK0MTuUqxLy08F73sgTm4A-2Fx1MNuxerOnfFbVXRCKb5AhxJqyAqORwlP6X7MsDOgbyzskKYt9Ct222iM6f0Q-3D-3DQAz6_64yHpLas58CGHFosopoZrGkOXL2-2FeZkmSK4mtKF232kRTwgMug85Pbu3CVVAZM9YW-2FjAAbM1b-2F92eP15q67vbHfL8o76Ws-2FTTF-2Fj8AkyY0I-2F7lQaV9k5q4URUXrHWcCR-2FGwiv0AuwBNvyxCipa-2BG4MVCgunL20GBE2zwOcPe5MKQS3MBHiw4ljB6vJRsMnm94r-2B4hnZ-2BNhORfptkVKLIA9D8DwiciO2442gSICEYUQLJRI-2FLoxuQVbVI2cxo6EFesmIzX98mXYXnhYtLascIqhuY0V94HBu7eZ3S5F-2B9kZREVMPE-2BCZZrKN-2BftqL1h5nA30wOP7pe-2F8N8RlQSjYrrcjLQOuhFuTHVzMU8Xh2bpcmOvEP2KCbjTMKAKE-2BnEZuWIGhT-2FhiGE70lrmOM-2F-2Fyeg-3D-3D\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">topic.com</a>, AppleTV & iOS, Roku, Amazon Fire TV, Android & Android TV, Samsung, Apple TV Channels, Roku Premium Channels, Bell Fibe, Amazon Prime Video Channels, and Comcast (Xfinity X1, Xfinity Flex and XClass TV).
