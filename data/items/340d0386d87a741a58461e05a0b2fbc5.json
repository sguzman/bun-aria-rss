  "description": "About two years ago, I read the book The Year without Pants, which describes the author&rsquo;s experience leading a team at Automattic (the company behind WordPress.com, among other products). Automattic is a fully-distributed company, which means that all of its employees work remotely (hence pants are optional). While the book discusses some of the challenges of working remotely, the author&rsquo;s general experience was very positive. A few months after reading the book, I decided to look for a full-time position after a period of independent work."
