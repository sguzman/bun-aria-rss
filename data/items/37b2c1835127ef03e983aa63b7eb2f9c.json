  "description": "<p>With religious believers among the most likely to downplay the seriousness of both the pandemic and climate change, a recent article claims secular people and atheists are now more empathic and moral than conservative Christians. But is the problem really that evangelicals are less moral, or that they’re more easily deceived? Then, Matthew Soerens from World Relief talks about the unfolding tragedy in Afghanistan. What dangers do the thousands of Afghans who helped the American military face as the Taliban takes back the country, and what obligation does the U.S. have to help them? While evangelicals remain widely opposed to welcoming refugees, will they make an exception for those who risked their lives to help American troops? Plus, a strike at Nabisco threatens the country’s Oreo supply, launching Phil into a rant about cookie varieties and late stage capitalism.</p> <p>Patreon Bonus with David French: <a href= \"https://www.patreon.com/posts/55322869\">https://www.patreon.com/posts/55322869</a></p> <p>News Segment:</p> <p>Nabisco strike and Phil’s rant about cookie varieties [4:22] <a href= \"https://www.today.com/food/workers-us-nabisco-bakeries-are-strike-t228753\"> https://www.today.com/food/workers-us-nabisco-bakeries-are-strike-t228753</a></p> <p>Afghanistan, Haiti, wildfires, floods, heatwaves and droughts [19:12]</p> <p>Christian’s history with Afghanistan</p> <p>[20:40] Current situation in Afghanistan [24:40]</p> <p>Are Christians less empathic and moral, or simply more easily deceived?
