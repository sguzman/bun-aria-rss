  "description": "<p>Growing up in small town Arkansas, Brad Ford did not think of interior design as a career path until after college. He moved to New York on the recommendation of the one professional designer in town “with an office.” After design school, under the tutelage of Jed Johnson and Thad Hayes, he was able to hone his now-characteristic aesthetic of editing rather than layering. Editing is more than a style for Ford, but a philosophy that defines all of his endeavors: FAIR, Field and Supply, and his design firm. In this episode, he discusses the evolution of his businesses, and how Field and Supply, a culmination of his life’s work, brings him full circle.</p>\n",
