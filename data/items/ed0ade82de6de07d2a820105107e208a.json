  "description": "<p>Out of work since late last year, you were finally making progress on the job hunt until COVID-19 locked everything down. Now you've been making connections and finding opportunities on LinkedIn that seem promising. The problem is, your spouse is nervous that anything you post there will somehow hurt your chances for getting a job; it seems her resentment that you're not working -- added to the constant proximity of quarantining responsibly -- puts the world through a very negative lens and anything you say is stupid.</p>\n<p>So now she's monitoring your LinkedIn account from hers and picking fights with you every time you post anything there. Should you find another place to live for now while pursuing work, or should you just let your spouse control your online life and make that pursuit more difficult? We tackle this and more here on Feedback Friday!</p>\n<p>And in case you didn't already know it, <strong>Jordan Harbinger</strong> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JordanHarbinger\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@JordanHarbinger</a>) and <strong>Jason DeFillippo</strong> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jpdef\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@jpdef</a>) banter and take your comments and questions for Feedback Friday right here every week!
