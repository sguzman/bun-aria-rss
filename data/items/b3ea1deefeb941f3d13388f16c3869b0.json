  "description": "<p>This week, in Northport, New York, the teenagers of Long Island, in 1984, are out of control, between the drugs, the crime & all that Satan. One particular duo, which includes a young man known as \"The Acid King\", takes things to a new extreme, with a brutal & gory murder, that police call a \"Satanic sacrifice\". The strange thing is that every teenager in town knows about it, and plenty have even seen the body, but it takes weeks for someone to tell. It only gets messier from there, as something even more unexpected happens, followed by a mind blowing conclusion!
