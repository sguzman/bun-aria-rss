  "description": "Happy September Readheads! In this month's episode of The Readheads Book Club we are recapping and discussing Everything I Know About Love, a memoir by Dolly Alderton. We are talking about our favorite moments and stories from this book and what themes and passages really resonated with each of us. This book has just been made into a series on Peacock so we're talking about our thoughts on the casting in lieu of the Hollywood Treatment. As always we each also share all of the other books we read this month. Next month's book is Jackie's choice and she choice Lessons in Chemistry by Bonnie Garmus. The overall Readheads rating for Everything I Know About Love is 3.675.
