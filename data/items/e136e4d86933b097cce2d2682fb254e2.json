  "description": "<p>The Therapy for Black Girls Podcast is a weekly conversation with Dr. Joy Harden Bradford, a licensed Psychologist in Atlanta, Georgia, about all things mental health, personal development, and all the small decisions we can make to become the best possible versions of ourselves.</p>\n<p>What is your version of happy? Sure, we don&rsquo;t all have the same things in mind, but we do have something in mind when we think of personal happiness. Joining us this week to discuss how we work toward obtaining our vision of happiness is Rosetta Thurman, the Founder of Happy Black Woman. Rosetta and I chatted about how happiness is not about having stuff but instead about doing the stuff that you care the most about, how minimalism amplifies what we deem the most important, and how a minimalist approach to life can lead to us accomplishing dreams we&rsquo;d never thought we&rsquo;d see in this lifetime.</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<p>Visit our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/shop/therapy4bgirls\">Amazon Store</a> for all the books mentioned on the podcast.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Where to Find Rosetta</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://happyblackwoman.com/\">Website</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/rosettathurman/\">Instagram</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Stay Connected</strong></p>\n<p>Is there a topic you'd like covered on the podcast?
