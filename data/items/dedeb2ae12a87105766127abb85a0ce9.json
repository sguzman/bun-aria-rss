So when we suppress our hardest experiences and emotions, they linger in our bodies and hold more power over us. Befriending our emotions and facing them head-on provides us the support and space to heal our emotional wounds. And using our physical state to change our mental state, and vice versa, is an incredible tool for moving through difficult emotions and attending to our overall health and wellbeing. In his conversations with Tom Bilyeu and Dr. Jim Gordon, Dr. Hyman discussed specific strategies to do just that using simple physical exercises and practices.</p><br><p>Tom Bilyeu is a filmmaker and serial entrepreneur who chased money hard for nearly a decade and came up emotionally bankrupt. To that end, he and his partners sold their technology company and founded Quest Nutrition—a company predicated not on money, but rather on creating value for people with the mission to end metabolic disease, something impacting Tom’s own family. After exiting Quest and generating extraordinary personal wealth, Bilyeu turned his attention to the other pandemic facing society, the poverty of poor mindset. To solve the mindset problem at scale and help hundreds of millions of people adopt an empowering mindset he has co-founded the media studio Impact Theory with his business partner and wife, Lisa Bilyeu. Their aim is to influence the cultural subconscious by creating content that empowers people.</p><br><p>Dr. Jim Gordon is the author of The Transformation: Discovering Wholeness and Healing After Trauma and is a Harvard educated psychiatrist and a world-renowned expert in using mind-body medicine to heal depression, anxiety, and psychological trauma. He has worked with traumatized children and families in Bosnia, Gaza, Haiti, post-9/11 New York, and Parkland, among many other areas across the world facing tragedy and trauma. Dr. Gordon also works with veterans and active-duty military to address PTSD.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Find Dr. Hyman’s full-length conversation, “Why Your Mindset Matters If You Want Health And Wealth” with Tom Bilyeu here:&nbsp; <a href=\"https://drmarkhyman.lnk.to/TomBilyeu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://DrMarkHyman.lnk.to/TomBilyeu</a></p><br><p>Find Dr. Hyman’s full-length conversation, “Is It Possible to Truly Heal From Trauma?” with Dr. James Gordon here:&nbsp; <a href=\"https://drmarkhyman.lnk.to/DrJimGordon\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://DrMarkHyman.lnk.to/DrJimGordon</a></p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by Paleovalley.
