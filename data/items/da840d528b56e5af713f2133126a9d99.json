    "media:description": "With the cinema release of Halloween Ends film, I thought now would be the best time to do the timeline of the Boogeyman, Michael Myers.\nIn this video we'll be going over the life, evolution and dark history of Michael Myers. Created by John Carpenter and Debra Hill, starring Jamie Lee Curtis. I review the events of Hallowen 1978, Halloween 2018, Halloween Kills (2021), as well as including a Halloween Ends (2022) analysis. So let's smash some pumpkins!\n\nThank you to @CZsWorld.
