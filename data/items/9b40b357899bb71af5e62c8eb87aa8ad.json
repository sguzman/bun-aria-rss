  "description": "Our audiobook this week is OVER THE FALLS by Carmel Rhodes!\n\nNarrated by Lacey Laurel\n\nNote to self: never lie on your resume. At least not about important stuff.\nCan you speak Japanese? Sure.\nDrive a stick shift? No problem.\nScale a mountain? Hard pass.\nNow, because of the creative liberties I’d taken when I’d been offered the role my agent said would lead to an Oscar, I’m trapped in the middle of nowhere Alaska.\nMy only hope is a very grumpy, potential serial killer,  who plucked my unconscious body out of the river just before I followed my crew over the waterfall.\nCam is a hulk of a man. Surly, angry, mysterious. I don’t know if I can trust him, but I do know, without him, I’m as good as dead.\n\nMIDNIGHT KISS by Carmel Rhodes: https://amzn.to/35CfOCt\nCherry Bomb by Carmel Rhodes: https://amzn.to/2GVZxOs\nFlirting with 40 by K Bromberg: https://amzn.to/2Rvu0Ff\nTools of Engagement by Tessa Bailey: https://amzn.to/39tyXF0\nCarmel Rhodes GIVEAWAY!: http://readmeromance.com\nFollow Read Me Romance on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/readmeromance/?hl=en\nJoin Read Me Romance Headquarters on FB: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1681258945313004/\nFind Alexa Riley on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/authoralexariley/\nFind Tessa Bailey on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/tessabaileyisanauthor/\n\nPodcast Credits\nRead Me Romance Theme Song by L.B.
