  "description": "<p>Desperate Dems ditch masks, but we won't forget in November. Be a \"single-issue\" voter about covid failure, Clays says. Buck notes it's like magic because suddenly he is no longer getting stares as though he's \"an evil granny killer\" when he goes maskless in coffee shops. NYC mayor won’t lift vax mandate to get Kyrie Irving on the court, even though he remarks he's dying for him to play and the team to win. Psaki can't explain why Biden's not sanctioning Russian energy, because his anti-fossil fuel energy policy makes it impossible. Clay says you can't pretend to be a social justice warrior for not buying Russian vodka but pay huge sums to them for millions of barrels of oil. New poll: Biden approval down to 35%.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
