  "description": "The Left is doing the EXACT same things it's accusing Trump of! Stephen Colbert’s audience chanted “lock him up,” and apparently only “wackos” still believe the “nonsense” that Joe Biden could have done something wrong. From climate change hysteria to the nuclear family’s destruction to “straight white males need not apply” signs, everything is chaotic! Global chaos is spreading, as governments go AGAINST the will of the people from Brexit to the constant cries for impeachment. But are we really \"too stupid\" to know what’s right for us? Through it all, hold tight to Winston Churchill’s advice: “Keep calm and carry on.”\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
