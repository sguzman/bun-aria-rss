  "description": "I start this week with a classic rant… and say what a lot of people are thinking about political correctness in our society.  Luke Jacobi, director of operations at Benzinga and host of Power Hour, explains how Reddit’s WallStreetBets became one of the most powerful forces on Wall Street… and how Benzinga grew into one of the biggest financial media companies in the world. He also shares a couple under-the-radar ideas he likes right now. [14:52] Daniel and I discuss the latest regulatory crackdowns in China… and break down why you must pay attention to regulations and geopolitics when investing. We also consider Robinhood’s upcoming IPO… and whether we’ll be buying shares. Finally, we go over the latest Organization of Petroleum Exporting Countries (OPEC) meeting... and the impacts of not reaching a deal on production.
