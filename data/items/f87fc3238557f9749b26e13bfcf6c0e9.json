  "description": "<p>What’s Your Latest with CW&T: Chi-Wei Wang and Taylor Levy (Episode 111)</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://cwandt.com/\">CW&T is Che-Wei Wang and Taylor Levy</a>. They combine art, technology, design, and manufacture into everyday objects that have nothing everyday about them, as well as unique expressions of industrial design that can’t be compared with anything else. In this episode, we talk about one of their latest endeavors, <a href=\"https://cwandt.com/products/time-since-launch?variant=19682206089275\">Time Since Launch</a>, a single-use launch clock that counts indefinitely into the future.</p>\n<p>I first <a href=\"https://newdisrupt.org/blog/2013/2/27/episode-12\">spoke to Che-Wei and Taylor in 2013</a> about the Pen Type-A, their first highly funded project and one that had a lot of complexity. They <a href=\"https://newdisrupt.org/blog/11/14/actually-quite-likely-recorded-live-in-dumbo\">appeared with me on stage at the Nearly Impossible conference</a> with other makers later that year to talk more broadly about creating. (You can now purchase both <a href=\"https://cwandt.com/products/pen-type-a\">Pen Type-A</a> and <a href=\"https://cwandt.com/products/pen-type-b\">Pen Type-B</a>.)</p>\n<p>Six years later, the couple has completed dozens of projects of different scales and natures, moved from New York to Massachusetts and back again, and 3D printed two humans.</p>\n<p>Make sure and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/charliewhiskeytango/\">follow them on Instagram</a> to see their latest experiments, process photos, and new projects.</p>\n<p><em>Thanks to you and help support the show:</em> The New Disruptors is back on the air due to patrons and sponsors!
