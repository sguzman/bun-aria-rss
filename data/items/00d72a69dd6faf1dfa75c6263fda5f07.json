  "title": "316 - Bayer AG: The Most EVIL Corporation in the World?",
  "description": "<p>Is Bayer AG really EVIL? Or have they, like a lot of companies done both really good things - like marketing aspirin and other valuable medicine around the world - and really bad things, like market heroin after they knew it was dangerous, and perform deadly drug experiments on concentration camp victims? Yeah - that last one is real, REAL bad. But - how many corporate hands are truly clean? How many companies buy minerals from conflict zones, or materials from sweatshops? How many other companies today have Nazi ties, or more recent track records of selling products they knew were much deadlier than they were publicly letting on? Today we look at Bayer and Monsanto, and the dirty deeds they've done, but also, we zoom out and look at multinational corporations in general. Should we be more afraid of The State? Or the private sector? <br /><br /><strong>Get tour tickets at </strong><a href=\"https://dancummins.tv/\"><strong>dancummins.tv </strong></a><br /><br /><strong>Get Scared to Death LIVE tickets at </strong><a href=\"https://badmagicmerch.com/\"><strong>badmagicmerch.com</strong></a><strong>  October  27th, 6P PST/9PM EST.
