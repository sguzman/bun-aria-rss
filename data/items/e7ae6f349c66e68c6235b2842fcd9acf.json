  "description": "<p>Nikki and Andrew are in Mexico to film a TV show, that they probably aren't supposed to talk about but do anyway. Nikki tells a story about a car accident she was in before leaving St. Louis and a great lesson learned from it. Andrew has his clubs and looks forward to getting a hook up from the golf connection he made at the airport. Nikki talks about the comments made about her song for Bob Saget and knows what she signed up for. They skip the news but can't resist talking about a Taylor Swift headline. Nikki's Reddit dump has a hodgepodge of topics from working nuns to hairy legs.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
