  "description": "In the last few years, New York City’s delivery workers have become a key part of the food industry’s infrastructure, allowing restaurants to do business with customers who are too stressed to leave their desks, or too cautious to leave their homes. But a spate of violent attacks and bike thefts has shown that the people delivering your Grubhub and Seamless orders are deeply vulnerable. Why are these essential workers being exploited by apps and abandoned by the police, forced to band together just to get by?\nGuest: Josh Dzieza, an investigations editor and feature writer at The Verge covering technology, business, and climate change.\nWe’re re-running some of our favorite episodes from the past year. This episode originally aired in September of 2021.\nIf you enjoy this show, please consider signing up for Slate Plus.
