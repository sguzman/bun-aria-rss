  "description": "As police are still investigating the five deaths that have been tied to the Murdaugh family, we’re trying to answer a big question in this case — what happened to the money?\n\nFollowing the money has led us down some strange, unexpected paths in this story — especially in the last week when it was discovered that Alex paid $110,000 for a funeral home. This funeral home is linked to one of Murdaugh's alleged victims and also linked to a funeral director that once sawed a man’s leg’s off because he was too tall to fit in the casket.\n\nWe also share where the money went in the Hakeem Pinckney case… and which “associates” named in Alex's indictment benefitted from Pinckney's settlement. In this week’s episode, Mandy , Liz, and special guest Attorney Justin Bamberg take you through the paper trail of evidence and explain what it all means. \n\nAnd we have an exclusive bonus segment in this week’s episode: As Deadline first reported, a drama series based off the Murdaugh Murders Podcast in development at UCP, a division of Universal Studio Group. In this episode, you’ll hear from Erin Lee Carr and Michael D. Fuller — the creators and writers for the show in development— explain their vision and approach to the Murdaugh saga.\n\nAnd a special thank you to our sponsors: Microdose.com, Priceline, Embark Vet, VOURI, Babbel, Article, and others.
