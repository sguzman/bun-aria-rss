  "description": "<p>This week we could not be happier to be joined by our very good friend the actress, comedian and musician Kate Micucci to discuss her childhood obsession with radio call-in contests, something she was so skilled at that eventually her local radio station told her she had to stop calling in. Along the way we discuss the time Jonah won Lilith Fair and Poison tickets from his local radio station and took Vanessa to both shows (Lilith Fair proved to be better attended), the lasting benefits of taking keyboarding classes in high school and the time Kate and Vanessa performed at a nineties-inspired music festival alongside Matchbox Twenty... or maybe it was Third Eye Blind? Finally, we play an inspiring round of our viral segment Change.dork, which explores everything from the barriers to entry for Funkytown to Crocs etiquette. </p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
