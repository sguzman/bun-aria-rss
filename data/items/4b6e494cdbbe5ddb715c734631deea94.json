  "description": "Yochi, Jenn, and Zack talk about the state of play in Robert Mueller’s Russia probe — and why obstruction of justice, not collusion, may pose the biggest legal and political threat to President Trump. On Elsewhere, they look at Israel’s “Strippergate” scandal, in which recordings of Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu’s son and several of his friends boasting about strippers and hinting at shady business dealings have shaken Israel’s political establishment. Yochi shows off his Hebrew skills, Zack reminds us he’s an optimist, and Jenn enjoys hearing a little bit of Yiddish. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
