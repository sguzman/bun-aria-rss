This leads to a conversation about the differences between 'takers' and 'makers' and how they function in our society. Turning to the phones next they speak to a caller wondering if we may be able to harken back to days of yore with some Adam & Drew animations. They also speak to a caller whose mother had an adverse reaction to the monoclonal antibodies and suffered a bad reaction.\n\nPlease Support Our Sponsors:\nCameo.com/ADS\nTenThousand.CC, promo code ADS\nGetRoman.com/ADS\nLiveXLive.com/ADAMandDREW",
