  "description": "Steve sits down with Elise and Adam in his first podcast interview since Howard Schultz announced on 60 Minutes that he was \"seriously considering\" an independent bid for President of the United States. In 2019, a billionaire thinking about running for president is a topic of great consequence. As Steve himself has reminded us again and again over the last two years, these are extraordinarily dangerous times, and the very future of our republic may hang in the balance. We believe that at this pivotal moment in our history, words do have power and they do have consequences.
