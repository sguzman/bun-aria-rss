In this 10-episode series, we follow the adventures of Simone and his wife Anna as they enjoy <em>una settimana bianca </em>(a white week of winter activities) in the Trentino-Alto Adige region.&nbsp;In Episode 1, Simone and Anna make the most of their first day on the slopes. We hear lots of winter and skiing related vocabulary including works like: <em>sciare</em>, <em>gli sci</em> and <em>pista</em>. Join Mark and Francesca as they break down the language featured in Simone's first travel diary entry. <em>Andiamo a sciare!</em></p><br><p>The podcast episodes will be published weekly from 12th February.
