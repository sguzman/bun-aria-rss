  "content": "<p>Lately, I&rsquo;ve become worryingly knowledgeable in datasets for crosswords&hellip; so\nI&rsquo;ve written up basically everything I know that might be helpful to crossword\nconstructors (and makers of other word puzzles, too). However, in writing this,\nI realized that this may be helpful to just about anybody who works with words\n&mdash; lyricists, poets, marketers, scholars, etc. Hopefully there&rsquo;s something for\neverybody! So without further ado,</p>\n<h2 id=\"dictionaries\">Dictionaries</h2>\n<p>I&rsquo;ll assume you know what a dictionary is &mdash; if you&rsquo;re reading this you may\neven have a <em>favorite</em> dictionary (or a favorite dictionary <em>edition!</em>),\nwhether it&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://chambers.co.uk\">Chambers</a>,\n<a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com\">Merriam-Webster</a> or <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Google_Dictionary\">Google\nDictionary</a> (which, <a href=\"https://support.google.com/websearch/answer/10106608\">fun\nfact</a>, is mostly sourced\nfrom <a href=\"https://languages.oup.com/google-dictionary-en/\">Oxford Languages</a>).</p>\n<p>More interesting are dictionaries that allow you to search or query them in\nmore sophisticated ways: the most popular are <a href=\"https://onelook.com\">OneLook</a>\nand <a href=\"https://www.onelook.com/thesaurus\">OneLook Thesaurus</a>, where a user can,\nfor example, search <code>bl????rd</code> to find words that start with <em>bl</em>, end with\n<em>rd</em>, and have four letters in between &mdash; so <code>bluebird</code> would be a result.</p>\n<p>The main asset with these dictionaries is the <em>expressiveness</em> of the query\nlanguage, and in that regard <a href=\"https://www.quinapalus.com/qat.html\">Qat</a> (which\nis also available in French) handily beats OneLook: it can match vowels and\nconsonants (<code>bl@@#@rd</code>) and ranges of letters and lengths (<code>8-10:bl*rd</code>). Qat\nis also able to solve &ldquo;word equations&rdquo; (e.g.\n<a href=\"https://www.quinapalus.com/cgi-bin/qat?pat=ABCDE%3D.....%3B!%3DA%3CB%3CC%3CD%3CE\"><code>ABCDE=.....;!=A&lt;B&lt;C&lt;D&lt;E</code></a>\nfinds five-letter words whose letters are in strictly alphabetical order, such\nas <code>abhor</code> and <code>first</code>), and even <em>simultaneous</em> word equations (e.g.\n<a href=\"https://www.quinapalus.com/cgi-bin/qat?pat=ACB%3BADB%3BAEB%3B%7CACB%7C%3D5%3B%7CE%7C%3D1%3B!%3DC%3CD%3CE\"><code>ACB;ADB;AEB;|ACB|=5;|E|=1;!=C&lt;D&lt;E</code></a>\nfinds sets of three five-letter words that are all one letter apart, such as\n<code>beats, boats, brats</code> &mdash; useful for finding crossing words!).</p>\n<h2 id=\"augmented-dictionaries\">Augmented Dictionaries</h2>\n<p>Many tools supplement dictionaries with other data, such as etymology,\npronunciation or sets of related words. You might think that your favorite\ndictionary would already give you all of those things, but the strength here is\nin the ability to easily write very sophisticated queries, such as <a href=\"https://api.datamuse.com/words?rel_com=car&amp;sp=t*\"><em>&ldquo;what\ncomprises a car that starts with the letter\nT?&rdquo;</em></a>, to give you phrases\nlike <code>trunk, throttle, tailfin, third gear</code>.</p>\n<ul>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://www.etymonline.com/\">Online Etymology Dictionary</a> looks up word\netymologies, which is helpful for avoiding <em>&ldquo;shared roots&rdquo;</em> in cryptic\ncrosswords.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"http://www.speech.cs.cmu.edu/cgi-bin/cmudict\">Carnegie Mellon University Pronouncing\nDictionary</a> looks up word\npronunciations, splitting words up into phonemes. This may seem silly\n<em>(&ldquo;can&rsquo;t you just Google to learn the pronounciation of words?&rdquo;),</em> but with a\nbit of work, this dataset lets you look up homophones and Spoonerisms, as\nsome crossword construction software &mdash; such as <a href=\"https://exet.app\">Exet</a> &mdash; do!</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://rhymezone.com/\">RhymeZone</a> and its Spanish cousin\n<a href=\"https://rimar.io/\">Rimar.io</a> let you look up homophones, rhymes or near\nrhymes (RhymeZone actually uses the CMU Pronouncing Dictionary, among other\ndatasets!)</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://onelook.com/spruce/\">Spruce</a> looks up &ldquo;inspiring sentences&rdquo; &mdash;\nquotes, lyrics, proverbs and jokes, which are indexed from\n<a href=\"https://en.wikiquote.org/wiki/Main_Page\">WikiQuote</a> and <a href=\"https://commoncrawl.org/\">Common\nCrawl</a>.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://nutrimatic.org/\">Nutrimatic</a> looks up words or phrases mined from\nWikipedia. This allows you to, for example, find anagrams that form\nnatural-sounding phrases (e.g. <code>&lt;dictionaries&gt;</code> finds anagrams like <code>is a direction</code> or <code>i consider it a</code>, instead of anagrams that technically work\nbut are not natural-sounding, such as <code>ratio incised</code> or <code>tonic dairies</code>).</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://www.datamuse.com/api/\">Datamuse API</a> is a very expressive search\nengine that sits on top of OneLook and RhymeZone. Unfortunately, there isn&rsquo;t\na user-friendly frontend, so it&rsquo;s effectively restricted to people who are\nable to make use of programmatic access.</li>\n</ul>\n<p>Here, another shoutout goes to <a href=\"https://www.onelook.com/thesaurus/\">OneLook\nThesaurus</a> and\n<a href=\"https://www.quinapalus.com/qat.html\">Qat</a>, which use several datasets (such as\nthe <a href=\"https://wordnet.princeton.edu/\">Princeton WordNet</a> and Wikipedia category\nlists) to search words based on their meaning. For example, in OneLook,\n<code>process by which plants eat</code> gives you <code>photosynthesis</code> as the top result; in\nQat, <code>{hypo:color}</code> gives you words that mean &ldquo;color&rdquo;, such as <code>acrylic apricot blacken blueing</code>; also in Qat, <code>{hyper:agate}</code> gives you words that &ldquo;agate&rdquo;\nmeans, such as <code>entity matter quartz</code>. These searches make it easy to find\nsynonyms, hypernyms, hyponyms and other related words.</p>\n<h2 id=\"curated-dictionaries\">Curated Dictionaries</h2>\n<p>In the other direction are datasets that don&rsquo;t <em>augment</em> dictionaries, but\nrather <em>curate</em> them: their usefulness comes not just in what you <em>can</em> find in\nthem, but equally in what you <em>can&rsquo;t</em>.</p>\n<p>The most prevalent examples are wordlists and their cousins, seedlists. As far\nas I can tell, these are more useful for American-style crosswords, where there\nis a hard requirement for fully interlocking grids (and grid-filling\nconsequently is a more difficult and computer-assisted task).</p>\n<p>Wordlists tend to be personalized by puzzle constructors, and you can find some\nwordlists for sale, most notably <a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/WordList\">Jeff Chen&rsquo;s Personal\nList</a>. There are also several\nfreely-accessible ones such as <a href=\"https://www.spreadthewordlist.com/\">spread the\nword(list)</a>, <a href=\"https://github.com/Crossword-Nexus/collaborative-word-list\">The Collaborative Word\nList</a>, and <a href=\"https://peterbroda.me/crosswords/wordlist/\">Peter\nBroda&rsquo;s wordlist</a>.</p>\n<p>Other examples of curated dictionaries would just be lists of specific things.\nOne amazing example is the <a href=\"https://sites.google.com/view/expandedcrosswordnamedatabase/home\">Expanded Crossword Name\nDatabase</a>,\nwhich contains the names of notable women and non-binary people, with an eye to\nincreasing their representation in crosswords. Aside from that, I&rsquo;ve found\nWikipedia&rsquo;s &ldquo;listicles&rdquo; to be very helpful (e.g. here&rsquo;s a list of <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/List_of_Native_Americans_of_the_United_States\">notable\nNative Americans of the United\nStates</a>).</p>\n<h2 id=\"datasets-of-crosswords\">Datasets of Crosswords</h2>\n<p>Finally, let&rsquo;s not neglect the most obvious thing: literal datasets of\ncrosswords! These datasets are are significant works of crossword archivism,\nsince acquiring crosswords in bulk and structuring their contents requires\neffort and cleaning that few are willing to do for such trivial data. (Fun\nfact: according to <a href=\"https://cryptics.georgeho.org/static/documents/Selection_AppendixE_v2.pdf\">this 2004 selection\nguide</a>,\nthe Library of Congress explicitly does not collect crossword puzzles,\nsuggesting that they&rsquo;re too trivial for the national library!)</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.xwordinfo.com/\">XWord Info</a> is probably the dataset with largest\nfollowing, as it covers the <em>The New York Times&rsquo;</em> crossword and is actively\nmaintained.</li>\n<li>Among constructors of American-style crosswords, <a href=\"https://tiwwdty.com/clue/\">Matt Ginsberg&rsquo;s clue\ndataset</a> is the go-to dataset (since it&rsquo;s free and\naccessible to download), but it&rsquo;s unfortunately no longer actively\nmaintained.</li>\n<li><a href=\"https://xd.saul.pw/\"><code>xd.saul.pw</code></a> is an excellent dataset of American-style\ncrossword and clues from various publications that is also free and\naccessible to download.</li>\n<li>The <a href=\"https://www.cruciverb.com/data.php\">Cruciverb database</a> is also a\ndataset of American-style crossword and clues, but unfortunately requires a\nmembership to access.</li>\n<li>Finally, to plug my own dataset,\n<a href=\"https://cryptics.georgeho.org/\"><code>cryptics.georgeho.org</code></a> is a dataset of\ncryptic clues, with auxiliary datasets of cryptic indicators and charades.</li>\n</ul>"
