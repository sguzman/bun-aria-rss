He first appeared along with Lewis Baboon (French) and Nicholas Frog (Dutch) in 1712 in a pamphlet that satirised the funding of the War of the  Spanish Succession. The author was John Arbuthnot (1667-1735), a Scottish doctor and satirist who was part of the circle of Swift and Pope, and his John Bull was the English voter, overwhelmed by taxes that went not so much into the war itself but into the pockets of its financiers.  For the next two centuries, Arbuthnot’s John Bull was a gift for cartoonists and satirists, especially when they wanted to ridicule British governments for taking advantage of the people’s patriotism.  \n\nThe image above is by William Charles, a Scottish engraver who emigrated to the United States, and dates from 1814 during the Anglo-American War of 1812. \n\nWith\n\nJudith Hawley \nProfessor of 18th Century Literature at Royal Holloway, University of London\n\nMiles Taylor\nProfessor of British History and Society at Humboldt, University of Berlin\n\nAnd\n\nMark Knights\nProfessor of History at the University of Warwick\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson",
