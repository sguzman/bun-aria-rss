  "description": "<div>Hi Friends! <br>\nHope you are having a wonderful day so far. We've got a super long one today, we shall see how this one goes. I just have to say there was a lot more to this case, but I gave you a simple summary of it just because I know it can get a bit overwhelming. Unfortunately we will never really know how many people were victims and that is truly unfortunate. I had to add some kind of humor throughout, it was really the only way to get through it, this one bugged me for dayzzzzz. so gross. <br>\nÂ Please be safe out there!<br>\nI love you guys so much and appreciate all the love you send my way. I hope to be seeing you very soon , have a wonderful day and make some good choices ! <br>\nxo<br>\nBailey Sarian <br>\n<br>\nAlso, if you haven't already, check me out on YouTube @<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/baileysarian\">BaileySarian</a>!</div>\n",
