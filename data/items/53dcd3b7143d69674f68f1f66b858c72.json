  "description": "<p>Stephanie Hersh dreamed of a job in the culinary world, but she never imagined she would have a front row seat to the life of the biggest culinary icon around, Julia Child. Stephanie became Julia’s executive assistant in the most unlikely of ways, when a chance phone call came into the secretarial school she was attending after time at the Culinary Institute of America. The only catch? Julia wanted an office assistant, not a starry-eyed culinary school grad. Stephanie talked her way into the job and wound up becoming Julia’s right hand for almost 16 years. Today, Stephanie is a chef instructor with Oceania Cruises and is based in New Zealand. She joins host Kerry Diamond to share some of her memories, her thoughts on the film <i>Julie & Julia</i>, and what Julia was like as a boss. </p><p>Thank you to <a href=\"https://mommenpop.com/\">Mommenpop</a> for sponsoring this episode. </p><p>Our theme song is by the band Tra La La.</p><p>Subscribe to our <a href=\"http://cherrybombe.com/newsletter-signup\">newsletter</a> and check out past episodes and transcripts <a href=\"http://cherrybombe.com/radio-cherry-bombe\">here</a>!</p><p>Listen to Dishing on Julia, The Official HBO Max Companion podcast, <a href=\"https://cherrybombe.com/dishing-on-julia-episodes\">here</a>!</p>\n",
