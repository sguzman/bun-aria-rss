  "description": "In his new book, A Vulcan's Tale: How the Bush Administration Mismanaged the Reconstruction of Afghanistan (Brookings Institution Press, 2011) Dov Zakheim, former chief financial officer for the U.S. Department of Defense, describes his time as a Vulcan, one of the elite group of eight foreign policy experts who advised President Bush's presidential campaign, most of whom later served in the Bush administration. Zakheim brings an insider's perspective to the Department of Defense's management of the War on Terror, and is not afraid to call out people who were not up to the job. In our interview, we talked about why it's so hard to get rid of Pentagon weapon systems, what \"snowflakes\" are, and why so many former Bush Pentagon officials have written books. It's all there, and more, in Zakheim's eye-opening new book.\nPlease become a fan of \"New Books in Public Policy\" on Facebook, if you haven't already.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
