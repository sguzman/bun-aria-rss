Who would the listeners draft first? And what is the impact of Baltimore signing Sammy Watkins (11:30)? Does it affect the key Ravens players? Does it give a boost to Tyreek Hill? Oh, and we react to the 17-game season! ... Looking at our 12-team, PPR mock draft (22:00), what has changed since the last time we drafted in January? Aaron Jones moved up 11 spots. Josh Jacobs was down 18 spots. What about Kenny Golladay (30:36)? Why aren't we higher on Tyler Boyd (35:00)!? ... We continue to discuss the draft as we talk some strategy (42:00). Jamey took a RB with each of his first three picks. Heath took a QB in Round 3 and a TE in Round 4. Adam had a specific goal at QB and TE that he was able to accomplish in Rounds 6 and 7.
