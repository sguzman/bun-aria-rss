Later, Seniesa talks with Chris about her career, being a top 5 boxer in women's boxing, and what she expects from Amanda Serrano and Katie Taylor. Finally, Shakur Stevenson drops in to talk about how much he enjoys seeing Chris's scorecards. #Herd</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
