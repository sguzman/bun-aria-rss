  "description": "In our final show before the 92nd Oscars, we run down every category and predict what we think will win each award. Will it be a historic night for 'Parasite' and Bong Joon-ho, a sweep for '1917' and Sam Mendes, or a night full of curveballs we don't see coming? We also discuss whether the feeling of inevitability surrounding the acting categories has decreased excitement for the show overall.\n\nHosts: Sean Fennessey and Amanda Dobbins\n\n      \nLearn more about your ad choices.
