  "description": "<p>It’s the morning of March 31st, 2020. A jogger finds Dr. Beth Potter and her husband Robin Carre shot in the head execution-style in University of Wisconsin Arboretum. Carre is pronounced dead on the scene by police while his wife, who was still alive, was rushed to the hospital where she also dies. Initially the police believed this to be a random homicide, but after reviewing video surveillance and GPS data, they redirect their sights on a potential suspect: Khari Sanford - the boyfriend of the victim’s adopted daughter Mimi. </p>\n<p>In this episode of Body Bags, forensics expert Joseph Scott Morgan and Jackie Howard discuss the gruesome nature of this case, how the cooler temperature affected the crime scene (specifically, the blood), how conscious Dr. Potter was for the hours that she was alive after the attack and the motive of the suspect. </p>\n<p>Subscribe to Body Bags with Joseph Scott Morgan :</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/body-bags-with-joseph-scott-morgan/id1587763116\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\" data-linkindex=\"0\"><strong>Apple Podcasts</strong></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/385AEt9XDYJoCyWtGZo3bw?si=j4zNy8vhQISmIFTA0HvASg&dl_branch=1\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\" data-linkindex=\"1\"><strong>Spotify</strong></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.iheart.com/podcast/269-body-bags-with-joseph-scot-87375583/\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\" data-linkindex=\"2\"><strong>iHeart</strong></a></p>\n<p>Show Notes:</p>\n<p>0:00 - Intro</p>\n<p>1:32 - Background and overview of the case</p>\n<p>5:21 - Did Robin Carre die from his gunshot wound/was it exacerbated from the cold temperature?</p>\n<p>7:23 - Was Dr. Potter really still breathing when they found her?</p>\n<p>9:34 - The significance of the area where you’re shot</p>\n<p>12:01 - How do we know the victims were killed on the pathway where they were found?</p>\n<p>16:15 - Would the cooler temperatures affect the state of the blood found at the crime scene?</p>\n<p>18:26 - Shell casings</p>\n<p>21:10 - Was Dr. Potter in and out of consciousness the whole night before she was found?</p>\n<p>25:14 - Finding the suspect, Khari Sanford (the boyfriend of the victim’s daughter)</p>\n<p>29:41 - Hearsay and the weight is has in a court of law</p>\n<p>33:20 - Sanford and Mimi (the victim’s daughter) reportedly spoke of the parents having “bands of money” and that they were “rich” </p>\n<p>36:35 - Wrap up and final details</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
