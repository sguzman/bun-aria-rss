  "title": "248 - P.T. Barnum and His \"Human Curiosities\"",
  "description": "<p>Big episode for a big, complex topic today. PT Barnum has been called the The Greatest Showman on Earth. And he certainly was the most famous promoter of the 19th century. He brought entertainment to millions, and millions loved him for it. He also stirred up a fair amount of controversy and many in the modern day have not looked back kindly on him. He often lied to his audience about the nature of his acts - and his acts were often people with physical abnormalities or deformities. Did he exploit them for profit? Yes. Without a doubt. But did he also provide for them a means to make life-changing and empowering income? He did. Does that justify the exploitation? That's up to you to decide. PT Barnum continues to entertain (and probably offend) today, on Timesuck. Hail Nimrod! <br /><br />The first Bad Magic Productions June charity we are proud to donate $7,050 towards is Trinity Stables. They run a speciality program in Georgia called Stable Moments, a weekly mentorship program that utilizes equine-assisted learning to achieve life skills that better prepare foster and adopted kids for healthy transitions into adulthood.
