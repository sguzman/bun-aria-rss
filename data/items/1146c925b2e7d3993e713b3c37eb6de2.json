  "title": "289: Fun Is a Trainable Skill (And It Doesn't Involve Your Phone) | Catherine Price",
  "description": "At a time like this, fun may seem frivolous. But our guest today is going to argue — convincingly, in my opinion — that fun is absolutely essential to a well-lived life. She has thought deeply about what actually constitutes fun, and how we can best live a life that is conducive to fun. In other words, she argues that fun is a trainable skill. You may have heard of Catherine Price. She’s been on the show before. She wrote an excellent book called How To Break Up With Your Phone, which had a significant influence on me. We start our conversation by talking about ways to achieve what she calls “screen/life balance” during a time of pandemic and political upheaval, and then we flow directly into fun, which is something you can only have when you put your phone down.\nWhere to find Catherine Price online:\nWebsite: http://catherineprice.com/\nSign up for the #FunSquad: https://mailchi.mp/screenlifebalance/funsquad\nResources for Screen//Life Balance including a 3-day challenge and social media detox course: screenlifebalance.com\nCatherine's writerly social media:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/catherine_price\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_catherineprice/\nSocial Media \"intervention feeds\" (designed to help you catch you while you're mindlessly scrolling and help you re-direct your attention):\nInstagram: @screenlifebalance / https://www.instagram.com/screenlifebalance\nTwitter: @screenlifeblnce / https://twitter.com/screenlifeblnce\nFacebook: @slbalance / https://www.facebook.com/slbalance/\nBooks: http://catherineprice.com/books\nIn case you missed it, we're running a podcast series to help you stay sane and engaged during this election season — without burning out.
