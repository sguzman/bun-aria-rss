Detectives wasted no time in collecting evidence and pursuing suspects but the case was looking bleak until word came in that an incarcerated man by the name of Juan Rivera might know something about the crime. After four days of interrogation, Juan relented and a confession followed. Join Aaron and special guest Robin Warder of The Trail Went Cold as they discuss one of the most infuriating cases we have ever heard of.
