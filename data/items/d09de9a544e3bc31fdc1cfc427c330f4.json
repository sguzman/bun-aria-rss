  "description": "The Broads are joined by the hilarious and incredible Thomas Dale, a stand up comedian turned clairvoyant and medium. They chat about discovering his abilities at a young age and how he transitioned from comedian to clairvoyant. He then dives into readings with Bekah and Jess and it gets personal as they discuss family, past relationships, children, are visited by departed loved ones and more. Needless to say, Broads, they are obsessed with Thomas Dale. <br>THOMAS DALE: <br>Follow Thomas on Instagram at: https://instagram.com/thomasdale5 (https://www.youtube.com/redirect?redir_token=QUFFLUhqbXJpR0ZnSXBHZWwwbWN0eURvbnlad0ViMjhjd3xBQ3Jtc0ttMGxSSmRlTHA2eDQ1dWtQNnFqNG1ESXhRVTctZjRHUHZqMjdtSmdrNFMtWFBGaUplbGxIdi1jeFVpdzVSU0hmVWxZTUJnUFhNM3J3aDIxUDhzSnVZSkswQ1BuMjJwdE9fTkxha0pwVGtlbGEwSElsSQ%3D%3D&q=https%3A%2F%2Finstagram.com%2Fthomasdale5&v=KLcVI7Ze5jQ&event=video_description)<br>Book a reading with him by DM at @thomasdale5<br>THANKS TO OUR SPONSORS: <br>***CANDID: Get Candid’s risk-free starter kit and $75 off at Candidco.com/chatty<br>***RAYCON: Go to buyraycon.com/chatty for 15% off Raycon wireless earbuds!<br>***PRETTY LITTER: Go to Prettylitter.com and use promo code CHATTY for 20% off your first order!<p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
