  "description": "2013 has been an annus horribilis for thrash metal legends Slayer. In February, Slayer parted ways with longtime drummer Dave Lombardo for the third and likely final time. In May, guitarist Jeff Hanneman died of alcohol-related cirrhosis, after being sidelined for better than two years for a necrotic spider bite.\n\nAs these events unfolded, journalist D.X. Ferris was hard at work on his latest book on the band, Slayer 66 2/3: The Jeff & Dave Years (6623 Press, 2013). It examines Slayer’s origins and development over the past thirty years and makes a persuasive case for Slayer’s musical and cultural influence. Ferris argues, “Slayer remains the all-time quintessential heavy metal band. And metal, more than ever, is significant. The genre has established itself as a permanent part of popular culture. And Slayer are metal’s pre-eminent prophets of rage.”\n\nDrawing on a wide and deep pool of source material, including the author’s own interviews with band members, Slayer 66 2/3 is likely to become the definitive history of this seminal heavy metal band. For his part, Ferris probably knows more about the band than anyone outside of its inner circle. Take a listen.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
