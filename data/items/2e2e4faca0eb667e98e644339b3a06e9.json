  "description": "<p>Amanda Knox was an 21 year old exchange student in rural Italy when she and her boyfriend were arrested for and convicted of killing her roommate, Meredith Kercher. It took nearly five years, almost all of which she spent behind bars, to clear her name. \n In this bonkers documentary from Netflix, Amanda herself takes us through the entire journey. We also hear from a human-garbage 'journalist,' A lead prosecutor who's tight with God, and a defense attorney who's zingers are the stuff of legend. \n This is part 1 of our 2-part series on this documentary. </p>\n",
