George Died Underwater; 10:29\n\nThis is our first EP and it's definitely not perfect. But we're mostly proud of it and excited to make more music, learn more and improve. We'll be livestreaming 12.18.20 at 6:30 PM (EST) to talk more about our music and the channel. Hope to see some of you there!\n\n► BANDCAMP: https://lifesurreal.bandcamp.com/releases\n► SPOTIFY: https://open.spotify.com/album/6tsGKm383nqr7G5IksWczW\n► TWITTER: https://twitter.com/lifesurrealband\n► INSTAGRAM: https://www.instagram.com/shawn.pc/?hl=en",
