  "description": "Our audiobook this week is TOASTY by New York Times Bestselling Author Alexa Riley! \n\nNarrated by Curt Bonnem and Elizabeth Hart\n\nMyra Michaels has been a personal slave to Kace Cox for far too long. She’s tired of him making her work all hours of the night and taking long work trips with just the two of them that could have been an email. She’s also really tired of the uncontrollable attraction she feels for him and she’s got to get away from it. But the day she quits, she makes an even bigger mistake and now she’s got a secret baby bump to think of. Hiding out in a reclusive billionaire&#039;s castle sounds like a great plan. That is until Kace comes knocking.\n\nKace Cox has wanted Myra since the moment she walked into his office. But his policy of not sleeping with employees leaves no room for his desires. He’s waited all this time and hasn’t touched another woman since the day he laid eyes on her. So when Myra quits she’s finally fair game. He gets just one taste of her and then she disappears, but she has no idea how determined he can be.\n\nWarning: What could possibly happen when he finds her?! Get toasty with us, because you know it’s a steamy happily ever after!\n\nCOZY by Alexa Riley (connected book - out now!): https://alexariley.com\n\nREBORN YESTERDAY by Tessa Bailey: https://www.tessabailey.com\n\nGIVEAWAY: http://readmeromance.com\n\nFollow Read Me Romance on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/readmeromance/?hl=en\n\nJoin Read Me Romance Headquarters on FB: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1681258945313004/\n\nFind Alexa Riley on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/authoralexariley/\n\nFind Tessa Bailey on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/tessabaileyisanauthor/\n\nPodcast Credits\nRead Me Romance Theme Song by L.B.
