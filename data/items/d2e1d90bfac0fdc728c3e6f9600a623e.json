  "description": "On today's show, the guys cover an American Airlines baggage handler falling asleep in the cargo hold of a plane in Kansas City and waking up in Chicago, an Australian man who died after being in a coma for several years after eating a slug and contracting rat lungworm, a 22-year-old Scottish man having his testicles bitten off by his own English bulldog, and a Buffalo Bills fan finding human feces under his seat before a game. Todd also wants to know what faction or group of people the guys would choose to lead from any time period. They also play a little fact or fiction, answer some listener questions involving forming political attack ads for each other and handpicking superpowers, and they end the show with some vitamin thoughts. It's a great time, come and join us.\n\nThis episode features @toddmccomas, @PatMcAfeeShow, @Digz, @nickmaraldo, @tyschmit, @BostonConnr, @VivalaZito, @evanfoxy, and @baileymccomas\n",
