Emma gets super passionate this week, talking through her childhood growing up around people with a lot more money than her, how her perception changed when she started making money on her own, and why she wouldn’t change a thing. Plus, questions on saving, supporting others, and she clears the air on an article written about her when it came to money struggles.\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
