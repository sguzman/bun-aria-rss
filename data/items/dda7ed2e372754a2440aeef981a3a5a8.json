We want to know why these rascal’s keep secrets, who they share them with, but also who they’re holding out on. The answers might surprise you. If you’ll listen I’m sure you’ll learn something about the people you THINK are your friends, but also yourself. You may be more slippery than you think and not as pure in motivation as you think.
