  "description": "<p>This week we finish breaking down Dunder Mifflin Infinity. We start off by answering some fan questions from the Office Ladies’ mail bag, including the scoop on where some mics were hidden around The Office set. A fan writes in to tell the ladies how the Office Ladies show inspired her to ask for more time off at work and she got it! Then the ladies break down Michael and Dwight’s quest to win over past clients with gift baskets, causing Angela to confess to her own basket obsession. We then tell you everything you want to know about the stunt of driving a car into a lake, which includes cinematographer Randall Einhorn protecting a very expensive camera. Jenna shares a story of trying to translate a French GPS in France and Angela tells real stories of people who followed their GPS into disastrous situations. This episode is jam packed, plus a little extra. Also, I love you. </p>\n",
