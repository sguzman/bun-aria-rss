    "media:description": "In the last video a viewer suggested showing the cheapest Big Mac, which would be more interesting. I agree, so here it is! The countries with the cheapest Big Macs. This data comes from the Big Mac Index, recorded multiple times a year since 1986. Basically those with cheaper Big Macs offer a lower cost of living, which is great for retirees and digital nomads.\n\nThe Big Mac Index was created by The Economist in 1986 as a way to measure the purchasing power parity (PPP) between different currencies. The index is based on the theory of PPP, which states that in a free market, the exchange rate between two currencies should equal the ratio of the prices of a basket of goods in each country. The Big Mac Index uses the price of a Big Mac as its basket of goods, and compares the price of a Big Mac in different countries to see if their currencies are under- or over-valued.\n\nhttps://www.economist.com/big-mac-index\n\nThank you for watching! \n\nMusic: Epic Motivation by Roman Cano from melodyloops.com",
