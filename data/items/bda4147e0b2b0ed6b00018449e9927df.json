  "title": "From the seas, to more ZZZs: Your new Pixel features",
  "content": "The best part of your Pixel is that it keeps getting even more helpful, and even more unique. With regular updates, Pixels get smarter, more capable and more fun. This latest drop is no exception, and for Pixel 3 and newer devices, includes the ability to easily access and share audio recordings, a new way to use the Pixel Camera app underwater and new wallpapers to celebrate International Women's Day.&nbsp;<div><br /></div><div><b>A more shareable Recorder&nbsp;</b></div><div>Whether it’s that guitar riff you've been working on or reviewing transcripts from a class lecture, Recorder makes it easy for Pixel owners to easily record, transcribe (English only) and search the audio moments that matter to you. Now you can share links to your Recorder audio files, so anyone can listen, even if they don’t have a Pixel. At <a href=\"http://recorder.google.com\">recorder.google.com</a>, you can hear recordings, see transcripts and even search through files — you get the entire Recorder playback experience in one shareable link.&nbsp;</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cgCEfrxrppA/YD1OYXhsCyI/AAAAAAAACwA/GQxNw1nTLbo0RMWSjUjH_5l11LvkzMn5wCLcBGAsYHQ/s960/Google%2BPixel_Recorder.gif\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"540\" data-original-width=\"960\" height=\"360\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-cgCEfrxrppA/YD1OYXhsCyI/AAAAAAAACwA/GQxNw1nTLbo0RMWSjUjH_5l11LvkzMn5wCLcBGAsYHQ/w640-h360/Google%2BPixel_Recorder.gif\" width=\"640\" /></a></div><div>You can also back up recordings to your Google Account to help keep them safe, and easily access them from any device.

Pixel camera software engineer, José Ricardo Lima, was scuba diving with his husband in the Philippines when he wondered what it would be like to use his Pixel camera underwater. His idea was to create a custom integration that combined Pixel’s camera with a case made for diving. Now, divers will be able to use their Pixel camera with the <a href=\"https://krakensports.ca/product/universal-smart-phone-housing-2/\">Kraken Sports’ Universal Smart Phone Housing</a> to capture marine life and seascapes. Get access to your Pixel’s camera features, including  Night Sight, Portrait Mode, Motion Photos and video directly through Pixel’s Camera app for high-quality images of you and your underwater friends. See <a href=\"http://g.co/pixel/diveconnector\">g.co/pixel/diveconnector</a> for more information.&nbsp;</div><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wq6yRebDTE0/YD1UM_wpXhI/AAAAAAAACwY/BkS26kJGI9IYIGzCk-jtMSO2RNOH4D6sACLcBGAsYHQ/s479/Screen%2BShot%2B2021-03-02%2Bat%2B7.49.59%2Bam.png\" style=\"margin-left: 1em; margin-right: 1em;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"479\" data-original-width=\"303\" height=\"400\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-wq6yRebDTE0/YD1UM_wpXhI/AAAAAAAACwY/BkS26kJGI9IYIGzCk-jtMSO2RNOH4D6sACLcBGAsYHQ/w253-h400/Screen%2BShot%2B2021-03-02%2Bat%2B7.49.59%2Bam.png\" width=\"253\" /></a></div><div style=\"text-align: center;\"><span style=\"color: #666666;\">Photo captured on Pixel 5 using KRH03 Kraken Sports Universal Smart Housing.
