It's not surprising then that most people say they'd like to travel more than they do. What's keeping them from fulfilling that desire? Well, one obstacle, especially these days, is that the high price of plane tickets puts flying out of reach.</p><p>My guest today can help you surmount this obstacle so you can get away more often. His name is Scott Keyes, and he's the founder of Scott's Cheap Flights and the author of <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3aYYOes\"><i>Take More Vacations: How to Search Better, Book Cheaper, and Travel the World</i></a>. Today on the show, Scott shares how scoring cheap flights can help you travel more often, the advantages of taking more frequent vacations, and the psychological benefit of planning your trips well in advance. We then get into the misconceptions people have about ticket pricing. From there we turn to Scott's strategies for booking cheap flights, beginning with why he recommends adopting a \"Flight First\" rather than \"Destination First\" approach. Scott shares the \"Goldilocks\" time window when cheap flights are most likely to pop up, the benefits of building flexibility into your itinerary, the days that are typically cheapest to fly, and his favorite search site to look for flights. He also explains how to use the 24-hour rule and Southwest Airlines as arbitrage in getting better prices on your tickets, and how to employ what he calls the \"Greek Islands Strategy\" to save money when flying internationally. We end our conversation with how to take advantage of \"mistake fares,\" and whether the high prices you're seeing this summer are here to stay.</p><h2><strong>Connect With Scott Keyes</strong></h2><ul><li><a href=\"https://scottscheapflights.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Scott's Cheap Flights</a></li><li><a href=\"https://twitter.com/smkeyes\" target=\"_blank\">Scott on Twitter</a></li></ul><img src=\"https://content.artofmanliness.com/uploads/2022/06/81HJDExK6vL.jpeg\" alt=\"\" />\n",
