  "description": "<p>Variational Monte Carlo with neural network quantum states has proven to be a\npromising avenue for evaluating the ground state energy of spin Hamiltonians.\nHowever, despite continuous efforts the performance of the method on frustrated\nHamiltonians remains significantly worse than those on stoquastic Hamiltonians\nthat are sign-free. We present a detailed and systematic study of restricted\nBoltzmann machine (RBM) based variational Monte Carlo for quantum spin chains,\nresolving how relevant stoquasticity is in this setting. We show that in most\ncases, when the Hamiltonian is phase connected with a stoquastic point, the\ncomplex RBM state can faithfully represent the ground state, and local\nquantities can be evaluated efficiently by sampling. On the other hand, we\nidentify several new phases that are challenging for the RBM Ansatz, including\nnon-topological robust non-stoquastic phases as well as stoquastic phases where\nsampling is nevertheless inefficient. Furthermore, we find that an accurate\nneural network representation of ground states in non-stoquastic phases is\nhindered not only by the sign structure but also by their amplitudes.\n</p>",
