You need the entire value chain in the room,” said MacArthur, adding that though such comprehensive change is a challenge, it's also an opportunity. Circular business models, including resale and rental, are on track to become a $700 billion market representing 23 percent of the fashion industry by 2030. </p> <p>“Business as usual doesn't work,” said MacArthur. “It's not the solution.”</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
