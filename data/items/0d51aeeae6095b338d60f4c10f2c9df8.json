  "description": "<p>Four time bestselling author (and human guinea pig) A.J. Jacobs gets us laughing, and thinking, about the benefits of lifestyle experimentation. In this episode, we discuss A.J.’s courageous journey to learn everything about the world via reading the entire encyclopedia Britannica. A.J. talks about his book<em><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Drop-Dead-Healthy-Humble-Perfection-ebook/dp/B005GG0N3M?ie=UTF8&ref_=asap_bc#navbar\" target=\"_blank\"> Drop Dead Healthy</a>, </em>where he spent months pursuing perfect physical health. We learn from his experiences following the bible (as literally as possible) for an entire year, and much more. Topics include: The importance of gratitude, what it’s like to win the lottery, the benefits of running electricity through the brain, and the differences between being psychotic, psychopathic and sociopathic. It’s an especially eclectic and playful episode that provides deep insight into what it means to live well. We hope you have as much fun listening to the episode as we had recording it. And feel free to leave a review on iTunes if you’re feeling compelled (it’s a big help to our cause and we thank you in advance)!</p>\n<hr />\n<p>Support this podcast: <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/the-psychology-podcast/support\">https://anchor.fm/the-psychology-podcast/support</a></p>\n",
