  "description": "<p>Between you and Nikki, it made sense to listen to Making Sense to fight off a migraine instead of taking dog meds. Andrew dressed up and not as a tribute to his latest dead hero, instead to a living legend. Nikki praises her assistant who keeps her life in order and Andrew thanks his brother for helping him survive a trip across Europe. They discuss \"roast\" jokes and how a reaction can make or break the moment. You Heard It Here First, get a diaper delivered with your meal, lime scooters are ok but not lime mopeds and Andrew's Weekly Sports Moment is about an elderly runner. Besties share a secret, being autonomous at a pharmacy and a funny moment from an SSDJ. In the Final Thought they have a conversation about acknowledgement.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
