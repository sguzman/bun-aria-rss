One reason is that we know a lot about this virus now and have <strong>plenty of tools</strong> to fight it. We meet the superheroes prepared to help us defeat the coronavirus: Sgt. Socially Distanced, the Masked Mentor, the Testmaster and the Vaxinator! Plus: Gilly, one half of the hit podcast <em>Going Viral with Kara and Gilly</em>, and a special guest explain what a virus variant is and how the delta variant is different from the original coronavirus. Also, journalist Sarah Zhang helps us understand how the pandemic <strong>could</strong> end.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>All that, plus a new mystery sound and a Moment of Um that answers the question \"How do skunks spray their stink?\"</p>\n",
