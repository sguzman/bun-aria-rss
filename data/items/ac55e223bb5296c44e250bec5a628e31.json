  "content:encoded": "<p>Since Memorial Day in the U.S. is the unofficial start of the summer season, I figured today would be a good time to launch the SUMMER OF DATA SCIENCE 2017!!!</p>\n<p><strong>The Summer of Data Science is a commitment to learn something this summer to enhance your data science skills, and to share what you learned.</strong> (Those of you in the Southern Hemisphere will have to pick up the excitement when we&#8217;re winding down during our fall/your spring and keep it going! Or, join us during your Winter of Data Science!)</p>\n<p>For those of you who haven&#8217;t been following me for years, a hashtag I started back in 2015, #SoDS, is actually one of the things that started growing my twitter following. Here&#8217;s the history:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/2015/05/18/summer-of-data-science-2015/\" target=\"_blank\">Coming up with the hashtag</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/2015/06/09/may-2015-sods-storify/\" target=\"_blank\">1st month of tweets, May 2015 Storified</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://storify.com/BecomingDataSci/sods-june-2015\" target=\"_blank\">June 2015 #SoDS Storify</a></p>\n<p>Unfortunately, I didn&#8217;t keep up the &#8216;Storification&#8217; after that, but you get the idea. It brought a bunch of us together to share our learning progress. We learned from each other, encouraged each other, and most of all geeked out about data science together!</p>\n<p>I didn&#8217;t launch one last year, because I was starting a new job and taking a break from recording the podcast, and just didn&#8217;t want to take on too much. But I missed it, so I didn&#8217;t want to let another year pass without a Summer of Data Science, so we&#8217;re going to do it together again this year!</p>\n<p>So, here are the only &#8220;rules&#8221;:</p>\n<blockquote><p>How to participate in the Summer of Data Science:</p>\n<ol>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 1em;\">Pick a thing or a short list of things related to data science that you want to learn more about this summer.</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 1em;\">Make a plan to learn it (like an online course, a practice project, etc.).</li>\n<li style=\"margin-bottom: 1em;\">Share that plan on social media, then post updates as you make progress, with the hashtag #SoDS17.</li>\n</ol>\n</blockquote>\n<p>That&#8217;s it! (And yes, there&#8217;s a chef competition that used the same hashtag. No worries! Enjoy the food pics.) </p>\n<p>If you&#8217;re looking for ideas for learning projects or topics, check out the <a href=\"http://www.becomingadatascientist.com/learningclub/\" target=\"_blank\">Data Science Learning Club</a>! Please write about your learning experiences and share in the <a href=\"http://www.becomingadatascientist.com/learningclub/forum-30.html\" target=\"_blank\">Data Science Learning Club #SoDS forum</a>, and/or on your own blog, and share on social media. I&#8217;ll check out the hashtag on twitter regularly and RT others. I&#8217;ll be participating myself, too!</p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s a link to the hashtag on twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%23SoDS17\" target=\"_blank\">#SoDS17</a>. See you there!</p>\n<p>P.S. Did you know that there is a <a href=\"https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/2015/06/08/monday-silliness/\" target=\"_blank\">&#8220;Summer of Data Sci&#8221; song</a>? :D</p>\n<p>P.P.S. There are now <a href=\"https://teespring.com/stores/becoming-a-data-scientist\" target=\"_blank\">Summer of Data Science 2017 t-shirts and tanks</a> in the Becoming a Data Scientist teespring shop!</p>\n<p>UPDATE: Here is a twitter Moment with a selection of tweets from the #SoDS17 participants this year! (It starts out with a bunch of intro tweets from me, but click through to twitter and keep scrolling!)<br />\n<a class=\"twitter-moment\" href=\"https://twitter.com/i/moments/878277513130192896\">Summer of Data Science 2017</a> <script async src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script></p>\n",
