  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, WJNO host Brian Mudd fills in. A cease-fire was announced between Israel and Hamas but those arrangements rarely end well when dealing with terrorists that are committed to eradicating the state of Israel. Hamas never would have attacked Israel while Donald Trump was President. In fact, after decades of threats about terrorism entering our Constitutional republic, sadly it has happened. President Biden had one brief encounter with Squad member, Rashida Tlaib and immediately called on Israel to stop defending themselves. What's up is down and what's down is up? Then, school kids are being taught that there are more than two genders. Former AG Bill Barr spoke today and accurately pointed out that President Obama never stood up for school choice. It is school choice that will combat the systemic inequality that Democrats have weaved into America's public school districts. Afterward, Biden shut down the Keystone Pipeline in the US but turned a blind eye and allowed Putin to start selling Russian oil and gas to its European neighbors.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
