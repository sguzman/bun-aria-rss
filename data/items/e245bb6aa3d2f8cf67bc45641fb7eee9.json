  "description": "<p>The world tells us to prepare our children to be athletes, successful business people, and helpful citizens; but as Christian moms, we aim for something eternally important. Our goal isn't just to have \"good\" kids, but to have children that know and love Jesus. We want to help our children not just do what's right on the outside, but to think through honoring God from a right heart. How can we do this well? In this episode, Emily and Laura close out the year with a reminder about our most important mission as moms. Let's finish 2016 well mamas, and go into 2017 with hearts that long to pour rich biblical truth into our children! </p> <p>Like what you hear?
