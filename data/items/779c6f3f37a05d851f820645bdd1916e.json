  "description": "<p><p>Kirk Minihane is obsessed and he's done pretending. Is it healthier for him to move on from the WEEI debacle? Would it be better for his new Barstool Show? Would it help is old friends? Yeah, maybe. But he doesn't care. He's enjoying the talentless misery his enemies are choking on right now. Plus, Joe Rogan is in hot water (maybe?). Steve Robinson refuses to shave until Blind Mike gets paid. Kirk explores Mike's mommy issues. </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
