  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, lawmakers seek solutions to tampon shortage - did you ever think you'd read a headline like this in America? Democrats say this is just a longer-lasting effect of the pandemic-related supply chain shortage and increased costs due to inflation. Democrats are now suggesting using the Defense Production Act to increase tampon production. Then, Democrat Party doesn't fit into our system as a constitutional republic, it's an alien force in this country. Politicians and bureaucrats are seizing power and using the government's power to take control of private companies in the name of the Defense Production Act. Oil executives say that the U.S policy to decrease demand for fossil fuels will only ensure that no new refineries are ever built in the USA. This all but guarantees higher prices since domestic production has diminished. Later, Ronald Reagan tried to strengthen the currency and squeeze inflation out of our economy. In today's case, President Biden is causing inflation by spending massively and printing cash just as fast. Afterward, Attorney Harriet Hageman joins the show to discuss her campaign challenging Rep. Liz Cheney in Wyoming. Hageman says that Cheney is MIA and nowhere to be found in Wyoming, but easily found advancing the swamp's agenda in Washington, DC. \n\n \njune 15, shortage, tampon, defense production act, economy, inflation, oil, gas, Oil Refinery, gas prices, stagflation, JAN 6, JANUARY 6, loudermilk, bill barr, barr, border, border patrol, scotus, supreme court, kavanaugh, harriet hageman, hageman, mitch mcconnell, mcconnell, Mayra Flores, flores, texas, wyoming, LIZ CHENEY, CHENEY\nLearn more about your ad choices.
