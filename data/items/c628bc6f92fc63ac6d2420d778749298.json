  "description": "They Might Be Giants. Even old New York was once New Amsterdam. Today, we continue the conversation on the supernatural, spiritual elements of the New Creation vs. Old Creation dynamics. And this is some of the crazy stuff: the Nephilim! What are the Nephilim? How do they play into the narrative? Were they real? How do they correlate to the Seraphim, Satan and other spiritual entities? How do David and Goliath fit in? What about David and Bathsheba? And lastly and most importantly, how do these giants play into our understanding of Jesus, etc.??? Holy moly.\n\nWe also discuss some listener feedback over the previous episode, some pushback on the conversation over the church and those that choose to leave.\n\nURGENT!!: Episode 300 is right around the corner and it is the moment where VOX evolves into its next iteration. As part of that, we want to include you. We will be discussing the future of the church, in both hope and lament. We’d like to have your voices as part of the conversation as a 30 second max message of hope or lament for the church, reflecting on what has been exposed over the last few years. We’d also love a bunch of one word responses, whatever they may be.\n\nEither: Record a voice message on your phone and email it to tim@voxpodcast.com or call this Google Voice number and leave it as. A voice message: (530) 492-0382\n\n\nAs always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue. Always feel free to email in questions to hello@voxpodcast.com, and to engage the conversation on here and Instagram.  \n\nLearn more about the VOX Podcast:\nVoxpodcast.com\n\nSubscribe on iTunes - apple.co/1Lla1Nj\n\nSupport the VOX Podcast on Patreon:\nwww.patreon.com/voxpodcast\n\nFollow us on Instagram: @voxpodcast\nLike us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/voxpodcast\nFollow Mike on Twitter: www.twitter.com/mikeerre\n\nMusic in this episode by Timothy John Stafford\nwww.timothyjohnstafford.com\nInstagram & Twitter: @GoneTimothy\n",
