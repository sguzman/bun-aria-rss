  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, according to recent reports huge droves of American families are flocking to homeschool. They are fed up with the way the school system has responded to the coronavirus and are now choosing to educate their children themselves. There is good reason to think that this shift may be permanent, and part of a larger trend. And that is a very good thing, because we cannot reclaim our culture until we break the public school system’s stranglehold on our children. Also Five Headlines including the media flipping out because Bill Barr allegedly wants to arrest and try protesters with sedition and arrest the mayor of Seattle, among other things. We’re supposed to hate Barr for this but instead I kind of want to make him king. And in our Daily Cancellation, I will cancel the Cardinal in New Jersey who says a Christian can in good conscience vote for Joe Biden. No, a Christian cannot.\nIf you like The Matt Walsh Show, become a member TODAY with promo code: WALSH and enjoy the exclusive benefits for 10% off at https://www.dailywire.com/walsh\nLearn more about your ad choices.
