  "description": "<p>“But I had fun growing up, you know, kids Double Dutch and playing football in the front yard, trash can basketball, running around 40 deep into projects with extended family, cutting the lights off—we really have fun. Of course, you've seen the drug selling, you've seen the dice games. We found a way to become comfortable in an uncomfortable situation.” Keith Corbin’s story is unlike any we’ve heard for a James Beard Award nominated chef, and he holds nothing back in his candid memoir, <a href= \"https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/california-soul-keith-corbin/1141097479?ean=9780593243824\"><em>California Soul: An American Epic of Cooking and Survival</em></a>. Keith joins us on the show to talk about representation, the realities of second chances (and why opportunity without support isn’t enough), fact-checking his memories with members of his community, the start of his friendship with fellow chef Daniel Patterson, unexpected loneliness and much more with Poured Over’s host, Miwa Messer.</p> <p> </p> <p>Featured Book:</p> <p><em>California Soul</em> by Keith Corbin</p> <p> </p> <p>Poured Over is produced and hosted by Miwa Messer and mixed by Harry Liang.
