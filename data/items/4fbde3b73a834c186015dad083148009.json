  "title": "PMS 2.0 177 - Benjamin Watson, AJ Hawk, & Cam Heyward Join Us For Day 6 Without Sports.. Good Show Though",
  "description": "Today's show is bookended by two great interviews, with another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk in the middle of the show. First, 16 year NFL veteran, Super Bowl Champion, former Tight End for the Patriots, Ravens, and Saints, among others, Benjamin Watson, joins the show to discuss everything going on with Tom Brady and whether he is shocked with his decision to go to Tampa Bay, what it was like playing with him, and what the differences are between a franchise with a winning culture and one that doesn't necessarily have that (3:20-17:03). Next, AJ Hawk joins Pat again for some McAfee Hawk Sports Talk where they discuss everything happening with free agency thus far, react to Brady going to Tampa Bay, Phillip Rivers going to the Colts, and the comments from Bill O'Brien to DeAndre Hopkins on his way out of Houston, among many other topics (17:05-1:26:38). To end the show, 3x Pro Bowler, 2x 1st Team All-Pro, defensive lineman for the Pittsburgh Steelers, Cameron Heyward joins the program. They chat about the Steelers outlook next year with Big Ben coming out, his thoughts on the CBA situation, what he's been doing during the quarantine, and what it's like to play for Mike Tomlin (1:30:26-1:46:29) Today's show is a fun one. Don't forget to join us everyday at youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow where we will be going live for McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk, the live radio show, Office Olympics, and other events to help you get through these trying times. Come and laugh with us, cheers.\n",
