  "description": "<p>In this July 30th, 2018 edition of The Herd with Colin Cowherd, Colin dissects New England quarterback Tom Brady's interaction with Boston sports media members over the weekend--specifically a question regarding suspended Patriots' wide receiver Julian Edelman and athletic trainer Alex Guerrero.  No question is off the table according to Colin's reasoning.  Also, it turned out to be a unifying weekend for the Dallas Cowboys after former Cowboy wide receiver and current free agent Dez Bryant went on a Twitter blast of his old team.  Finally, quarterback Sam Darnold is a New York Jet.  Colin is high on Darnold, but how does he feel about the rest of the 2018 NFL rookie quarterback class?  Guests include: FS1 NFL analyst Eric Mangini, The Monday Morning Quarterback Insider Albert Breer, and former teammate (and current friend) of Los Angeles Laker forward LeBron James, Dahntay Jones.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
