  "description": "<p>r/Maliciouscompliance In today's episode, a lawyer buys a house out in the country. A local farmer had a deal with the previous owner to mow the lawyer's lawn in exchange for being able to use the hay for his farm animals. The lawyer creates a contract that screws the farmer in the deal. The farmer refuses to sign the contract, leaving the farmer with 20 acres of unmowed land. The funny part? Now that the lawyer's property isn't being used as farmland, the lawyer doesn't get to enjoy farm land tax rates, and now has to pay $50,000/year in taxes!</p>\n",
