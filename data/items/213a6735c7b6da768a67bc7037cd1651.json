  "description": "“Paula Huston wrote literary fiction for more than twenty years before shifting her focus to spirituality. She is the author of the critically acclaimed novel Daughters of Song (Random House, 1995), which the Baltimore Sun called “far and away the best book yet” about life in the classical piano world at Peabody Conservatory. Nominated for the Commonwealth Club of San Francisco’s Gold Medal for Best First Novel, it was also chosen by the Christian Science Monitor for its first “Novelist’s Debut” review and selected by the Music Book Society and Performing Arts Book Club. Her short stories have appeared in numerous literary quarterlies, including American Short Fiction, North American Review, Missouri Review, Massachusetts Review, Virginia Quarterly Review, Story, MSS, and Image, and were twice selected for the Best American Short Stories list.”\n\nI had the pleasure of interviewing Huston for over an hour about her new book A Season of Mystery: 10 Spiritual Practices for Embracing a Happier Second Half of Life (Loyola Press, 2012). We discussed the importance of purpose vs. the never-ending search for happiness, the importance of spiritual practices for deepening into the second half of life, and what monastics have to teach us about living a fulfilling life. Huston’s words are filled with gratitude and hope. You’ll fund Huston’s honesty and humility to be very touching and very inspiring.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
