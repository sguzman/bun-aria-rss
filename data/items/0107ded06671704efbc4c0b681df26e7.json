  "content": "<p>My love she lies alone, she cannot move\n<br />And yet her spirit soars across the sky\n<br />She’s held aloft by words enough to prove\n<br />Sustainer’s breath can make a woman fly</p>\n\n<p>When I am gone I feel I’m still with you\n<br />I leave a piece of me when I depart\n<br />This truth - how could it not be true\n<br />A part of you could never be apart</p>\n\n<p>What gift I have to give is given now\n<br />What song I have to sing already sung\n<br />You are the only qibla when I bow\n<br />You are the dhikr moistening my tongue</p>\n\n<p>O Lord! Shine down on her your Your loving light!\n<br />Let angels keep her comfort in the night</p>"
