We all go through difficult times, and we all battle with “mental health.” If there is a mental health day, it should be something that raises awareness that all people suffer from the “human condition”, that emotions like sadness, stress, grief and unhappiness are a normal part of life, and that we are there to help one another. This should not be a day to stigmatize some people with the label of “mentally ill” and deem others as “normal”.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Sign up to Patreon to get access to the ad-free version of this session + more bonus items: https://www.patreon.com/drcarolineleaf.</p>\n<p>Read the blog here: https://drleaf.com/blogs/news/should-we-have-mental-health-days-at-school</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>OFFERS FROM OUR SPONSORS:</p>\n<p>-<strong>Gladskin: Right now, Gladskin is offering my listeners 15% off plus free shipping on your first order at </strong><a href=\"https://gladskin.com/collections/acne-prone?utm_source=CleaningUpTheMentalMesswDrLeaf&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=q2_2022_podcast\"><u><strong>gladskin.com/DRLEAF</strong></u></a><strong>.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>-Chime: Get started with Chime today.
