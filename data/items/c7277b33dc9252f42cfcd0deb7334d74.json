  "description": "<p>Louise received a remarkable letter this week which sparked a discussion about manifestation, the law of attraction and all things “woo-woo.” This is definitely not an area of expertise for either of us, but we have both experienced some surprising results from changing our mindset. Is there something<em> to</em> the law of attraction? Or is it just that when we change our thoughts, we take different actions? We debate this, discuss our personal experiences, and touch on the emerging science that suggests the way we think really <em>does</em> alter our physical reality.</p>\n<p>We also answer a question from a listener who worries that her buddhist practice might smooth out her emotional ups and downs and negatively impact her work.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned:</strong></p>\n<p>Marisa Peer and Lewis Howes interview: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4TqTkks7AA\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=V4TqTkks7AA</a></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/dashboard/episode/bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\">bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</a></p>\n<p>Buy us a coffee at: <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\">https://ko-fi.com/artjuice</a></p>\n<p><strong>Follow us on Instagram:</strong></p>\n<p>@alicesheridanstudio</p>\n<p>@louisefletcher_art</p>\n<p>See fuller show notes on our websites:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n",
