  "description": "<p>Twenty years ago this month, letters containing&nbsp;<em>Bacillus anthracis</em>&nbsp;spores were mailed to various politicians and news media offices in the US, resulting in illness, death, and a widespread fear that transformed anthrax from an agricultural disease or occupational hazard into a potential weapon of bioterrorism. In this episode, we explore the many dimensions of anthrax, from the different ways&nbsp;<em>B. anthracis</em>&nbsp;can cause disease to the incredibly long and varied history of the pathogen, a history of which bioterrorism is only a very recent part. Adding to anthrax’s multifaceted nature is the fact that&nbsp;<em>B. anthracis</em>&nbsp;is an environmental pathogen, one that can greatly impact livestock and wild animals, which requires collaboration across fields to effectively identify and control anthrax outbreaks. To help us explore this pathogen from a One Health perspective, we were so thrilled to chat with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://twitter.com/johannasalzer\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Johanna Salzer</a>, Veterinary Medical Officer in the Bacterial Special Pathogens Branch at the US Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, who filled us in on the veterinary side of anthrax, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://mwalkerbio.wixsite.com/mwalker\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Morgan Walker</a>, spatial epidemiologist at the University of Florida, who talked us through the environmental factors that affect&nbsp;<em>B. anthracis&nbsp;</em>distribution and emergence.
