  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, seven months ago the US had approximately 7,000 troops in Afghanistan, the war was over and the troops were training the Afghans and providing air cover. President Biden reduced their air cover and slashed the number of troops in the region, now he is pleading with the Taliban to not attack our embassy because, as expected, they are taking over. The Taliban is executing anyone with an affiliation to the US military. Now the US is sending another 3,000 troops to rescue our civilians in the embassy. Our enemies in China, North Korea, Russia, and around the world saw Biden's miscalculation and weakness. China will feel emboldened to invade Taiwan, Putin will be emboldened to reclaim Ukraine and the United States will be humiliated even further. General Jack Keane calls in to explain that this withdrawal is problematic and that Biden knew it would endanger the American civilians left behind. He added that the geopolitical ramifications all equal a net political gain for Iran. Keane reiterated that the US pulled out all combat troops in 2014 and only left enough troops to train the Afghani forces. Then, the $5.5 billion boondoggle known as the infrastructure spending bill is the brainchild of Bernie Sanders and is ripped from the pages of the Soviet Union playbook. In the 1936 USSR Constitution, Stalin wrote that citizens had the right to work and the right to rest and leisure, as well as rest homes, sanitariums, medical services, and universal education through the university level. So much of this has been mirrored in the infrastructure bill to expand government services. This will make the US mostly socialist and push our public education to be more of an indoctrination system. Later, the United States' southern border is the biggest super spreader event in history because Biden is allowing immigrants open access to America. Migrants that have tested positive are being bussed into other cities and nothing is being done to stop it. If this isn't an impeachable offense then what is? Finally, Peter Schweizer calls in to highlight the media's obfuscation of Hunter Biden's latest scandal. Schweizer pointed out that Hunter’s latest video is problematic because it's a Joe Biden problem, not just a Hunter Biden problem. Some emails show that Hunter was paying his father's bills. Did anyone pay taxes on these gifts? Will the Manhattan District Attorney look into this?\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
