He has insinuated Prime Minister Shehbaz Sharif, Interior Minister Rana Sanaullah and intelligence official Major-General Faisal Nasser orchestrated the attack.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The cricketing hero-turned-politician &#8211; who has been calling for new elections since he was ousted from power in April &#8211; has been delivering impassioned speeches at gatherings across the country.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He was six days into a march from Lahore to Islamabad in his push for radical change when the shooting took place.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The news of Imran Khan, the founder of Bradford based charity Imran Khan Cancer Appeal (IKCA), being shot came as a shock to all of us. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Shafiq Rafiq from Imran Khan Cancer Appeal (UK) said: &#8220;The charity supporters, the staff and the wider community is really saddened by the new of an attempt on his life. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Our thoughts and prayers are with Imran, the person that died in the attack, the people who got injured and their families.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Imran Khan is the former Prime Minister of Pakistan. And yet, he remains most vividly in public memory as the captain who led the Pakistan team to victory at the 1992 Cricket World Cup. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The cricket legend has come a long way from sports to philanthropy to politics. Throughout this extraordinary journey, his driving force has remained the same: a desire for social justice and equality.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;We pray for Imran’s speedy recovery and humbly ask everyone to pray for him and for all those injured in the attack.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital (SKMCH) was the first step and milestone in Mr Khan&#8217;s charity work. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Mr Rafiq adds: &#8220;It [Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital] became a testament to Imran’s resolve and a national achievement that he is proud to have spearheaded. It remains at the forefront of Imran Khan’s ongoing philanthropic works. Thanks to him, free cancer care for the poor of Pakistan became possible.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Shaukat Khanum was a woman who was proud of her heritage. She hailed from a family of proficient cricketers, and a Sufi Warrior Poet. Hers was a pride she instilled in her children, along with an iron resolve. In February 1985, after a long and agonising struggle, Shaukat Khanum’s family lost her to cancer. She was 63 years old.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;Little did Imran know that the most painful event of his life would pave the way for a hospital that continues to provide hope for millions. Today, Imran Khan is a former Prime Minister of Pakistan. He is also the Founding Chairman of Imran Khan Cancer Appeal and Shaukat Khanum Memorial Cancer Hospital.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;From the start, Imran was personally involved in the global fundraising effort for the project. Today, he is its Founding Chairman and is still involved in ongoing appeals and awareness campaigns, ensuring 75% of patients receive quality cancer care, free of charge.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p><br></p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.asianexpress.co.uk/2022/11/imran-khan-supporters-from-uk-charity-shocked-at-assignation-attempt/\">IMRAN KHAN: Supporters from UK charity shocked at assignation attempt</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.asianexpress.co.uk\">Asian Express Newspaper</a>.</p>\n",
