  "description": "<div>Here's the gist: During its 1980s and 1990s heyday, New Jersey’s Action Park earned a reputation as the most insane — and possibly the most dangerous — amusement park that ever existed. <br>\n<br>\nIt was known as a lawless land, ruled by drunk teenage employees and frequented by even drunker teenage guests. The rides were experimental and illogical, and seemed to ignore even the most basic notions of physics or common sense—not to mention safety.<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>Lying somewhere between <em>Lord of the Flies </em>and a <em>Saw </em>movie, Action Park is remembered as a place so insane and treacherous that, decades later, anybody who ever stepped foot in it is left wondering whether their memories could possibly be true. It became a nearly perfect breeding ground for urban legends and myths.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>LOOKING FOR MORE TCO?</strong> On our <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/TrueCrimeObsessed\">Patreon feed</a>, you'll find over 140 FULL BONUS episodes to <strong>BINGE RIGHT NOW! </strong>Including our episode-by-episode coverage of \"<strong>I'll Be Gone in the Dark</strong>,\" \"<strong>Tiger King</strong>\" <strong>\"Don't F**K With Cats,\" \"The Menendez Murders,\" \"The Murder of Laci Peterson,\"</strong> <strong>\"Casey Anthony: American Murder Mystery,\"</strong> <strong>\"Serial,\" \"The Jinx,\" \"Making A Murderer,\" \"The Staircase,\" \"Lorena,\" \"The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,\" \"OJ: Made in America\" </strong>and so many more! <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/TrueCrimeObsessed\">JOIN HERE!</a><br>\n<br>\n<strong>FAM!!
