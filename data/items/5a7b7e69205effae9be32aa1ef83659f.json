  "description": "Glenn and Stu discuss the disgusting and arguably inhumane debate between Senate candidates Dr. Oz and John Fetterman, exposing the Democrats' apathetic feelings toward mentally unfit candidates. Pat Gray joins the guys to discuss and compare who is worse, John Fetterman or White House press secretary Karine Jean-Pierre. The Fetterman/Oz debate wasn't the only important debate, as Glenn and Stu review the New York gubernatorial debate, where candidate Lee Zeldin exposed the corruption of Governor Kathy Hochul. Glenn takes calls from his listeners to gauge how they're feeling with the midterms approaching. Glenn previews his latest podcast with Arizona gubernatorial candidate Kari Lake.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
