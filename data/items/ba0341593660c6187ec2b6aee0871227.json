  "description": "<p><p>Grit Week 2019 is here and we rented a 1975 VW bus that is 100% going to get us killed before the week is over (2:27 - 7:50). Our guy Brooks Koepka wins the PGA Championship in convincing fashion proving Brandis Chambis wrong yet again (7:50 - 11:52). NBA Playoffs, Draymond's Team, and the Sharks laid an egg (11:52 - 17:16). Who's back of the week including Kyler Murray Height Truthers (17:16 - 32:52). Reigning NFL MVP Patrick Mahomes and fullback Anthony Sherman join the show to talk about Mahome's first full year, his dad playing baseball, how he pulls off the no look passes, and of course PFT's impression (32:52 - 83:26). Segments include PR 101 for Kevin Durant mad online, put one in his earhole Chris Long, Monday Reading and the dumbest GoT recap on the internet for that terrible finaleÂ </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
