He also talks about the show's intense commitment to detail, including its frequent visits to real-life New York restaurants, and whether he thinks the viewers of \"Billions\" are watching for the characters or for \"wealth porn.\" Plus: How Koppelman accidentally became a Vine star and why Wall Street power players are similar to experienced poker players.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
