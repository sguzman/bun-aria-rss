  "description": "<p>This week on <strong>The Real Housewives of Orange County</strong>, we celebrate Shane passing the bar! Or rather, Shane passively surpassing the bar's lower standards. But when you're in Orange County, you can't celebrate a milestone without someone's life falling apart. In this case it's Noella, who is understandably spiraling in the wake of her marriage dissolving. The real headline, however, is Heather Dubrow's chilling threat to Shannon. We'll be talking about that for years.</p>\n",
