  "description": "<p>Katy Perry is one of the best selling musicians in the world, the most followed woman on Twitter and the only known pop star to be tusslin’ with some nuns. It all began in 2014 when Katy tried to buy a convent that had been the home to a group of nuns for over 40 years. The nuns didn’t want to sell to Katy but the Archdiocese of LA did. So who owned the property and had the right to sell it? Tune in as we break down the bitter battle between Katy Perry and the Archdiocese, on the one hand, and a group of nuns and a restauranteur, on the other. <br/><br/>Click the link to see pictures of the convent: <a href='https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/real-estate/inside-katy-perry-convent-sparked-a-real-estate-war-1247527/'>https://www.hollywoodreporter.com/lifestyle/real-estate/inside-katy-perry-convent-sparked-a-real-estate-war-1247527/</a> <b> </b><br/><br/>Patreon: <a href='https://www.patreon.com/legallyjudgy'>https://www.patreon.com/legallyjudgy</a><br/>LinkTree: <a href='https://linktr.ee/legallyjudgy'>https://linktr.ee/legallyjudgy<br/></a>Instagram: <a href='https://www.instagram.com/legallyjudgy/?hl=en'>https://www.instagram.com/legallyjudgy/?hl=en</a><br/>Twitter: <a href='https://twitter.com/LegallyJudgy'>https://twitter.com/LegallyJudgy</a><br/><br/>Intro Song:<br/>Trick or Treat (instrumental) by RYYZN <a href='https://soundcloud.com/ryyzn'>https://soundcloud.com/ryyzn</a><br/>Creative Commons — Attribution 3.0 Unported — CC BY 3.0<br/>Free Download / Stream: <a href='https://bit.ly/l_trick-or-treat'>https://bit.ly/l_trick-or-treat</a><br/>Music promoted by Audio Library <a href='https://youtu.be/uNPXJ9CDzbc'>https://youtu.be/uNPXJ9CDzbc</a><br/><br/>Outro Song:<br/>Sundown Drive by Ghostrifter Official<br/><a href='https://soundcloud.com/ghostrifter-official'>https://soundcloud.com/ghostrifter-official</a><br/>Creative Commons — Attribution-ShareAlike 3.0 Unported — CC BY-SA 3.0<br/>Free Download / Stream: <a href='https://bit.ly/-sundown-drive'>https://bit.ly/-sundown-drive</a><br/>Music promoted by Audio Library <a href='https://youtu.be/2H-uKkyJzSs'>https://youtu.be/2H-uKkyJzSs</a></p>\n",
