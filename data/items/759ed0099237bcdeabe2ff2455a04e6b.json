  "description": "<p>In this episode of the Being Human Is Good For Business podcast, we talk to Vidhu Dev whose amazing career has taken her from being a qualified pharmacist to becoming a leader at one of the world’s biggest companies, GlaxoSmithKline (GSK) Consumer Healthcare. There Vidhu leads Rx to OTC Switch, Digital Transformation and R&D. </p><p>“Your mindset plays a major role in determining your leadership style,” says Vidhu Dev. “A creation mindset brings energy to your team. It encourages robust dialogue and causes people to test their thinking and experiment in new ways.” </p><p>She stresses that in leading teams means being a better listener than a talker. “To have a robust conversation means listening carefully to support emerging ideas. For example, when you sense some hesitancy, make people feel safe and encourage them to expand on or lean into their idea.”</p><p>Leadership coach Wendy Appel agrees. “This is called generative listening. It means listening generously, by giving full attention to what someone is saying without judgement or other internal filters. The goal is to listen and inquire. And one thing I've always admired about Vidhu is her curiosity. She's very curious.” </p><p>Listen to the show to learn more about the winning mindset, the hallmark of Vidhu’s leadership development journey and how her natural curiosity plays an important role in driving innovation within her team at GSK. Here are links to information about some of the tools and concepts discussed on the podcast: </p><ul><li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/-YbgpEqcPTU\">Generous Listening</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/blog/2017/10/24/perspective-and-the-infinite-game-99shw\">Leadership Mindset</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/blog/2017/9/11/science-resilience\">Leader Resilience</a></li></ul>\n",
