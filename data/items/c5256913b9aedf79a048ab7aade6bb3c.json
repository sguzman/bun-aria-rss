That's where concrete eggs and amphoras come in. </p> <p>We first address concrete, which is at this time, a bit more popular than amphora. The main benefits we discuss:</p> <ol> <li><strong>The shape of the egg allows for continuous flow to the wine as it ferments and matures, creating a more homogenous wine.</strong> <ul> <li>As fermentation creates heat, convection currents move the wine around, as it does in a tank or barrel. The currents are so strong, that the wine barely needs to be punched down or pumped over during fermentation. Battonage (stirring lees for increased flavor) also is barely needed. The lack of corners in the container mean there are no \"dead areas\" and the wine is more complex and uniform in quality and texture.<br /> <br /></li> <li>Tannins are softened during maturation: Similar to the benefits during fermentation, the egg shape constantly circulates the lees as the wine matures after malolactic fermentation so the tannins in reds are softer and finer with age in eggs.</li> </ul> </li> </ol> <p> </p> <ol start=\"2\"> <li><strong>Insulation:</strong> Concrete can be up to six inches thick so there is natural insulation from outside temperature swings that stainless steel tanks cannot provide without cooling or heating coils. This allows wine from concrete eggs to maintain freshness.</li> </ol> <p> </p> <ol start=\"3\"> <li><strong>Oxygenation (with a caveat):</strong> Unlined concrete allows tiny amounts of oxygen to permeate and come into contact with the wine (from inside of the tank when it first is put in the tank). This softens tannins, creates complexity, texture, and a better mouthfeel especially during fermentation. The wine is fruity without any oak flavors.<br /> <br /> <br /></li> <li><strong>Beauty and sustainability:</strong> The vessels are beautiful, can be customized, and they last forever if they are taken care of – score for sustainability!</li> </ol> <p> </p> <ol start=\"5\"> <li><strong>Ease of cleaning</strong> in a fermentation or aging vessel is really essential in wine. Sanitized vessels = clean wine. Concrete is easy to sanitize and clean.</li> </ol> <p><a href=\"https://www.concretewinetanks.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\"><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/egg-slide.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"450\" height=\"143\" /></a></p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href= \"https://www.concretewinetanks.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\"><em><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">Photo: Steve Rosenblatt, Sonoma Cast Stone</span></em></a></p> <p><br /> After we set up the history and benefits of concrete, I welcome the wonderful Steve Rosenblatt, founder and owner of <a href= \"https://www.concretewinetanks.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Sonoma Cast Stone</a> (and hobbyist winemaker!), the only manufacturer of concrete eggs in the United States, who gives us incredible detail on these benefits and more.</p> <p><br /> Next, we discuss <strong>amphoras.</strong> The benefits are largely the same (shape allows convection, clay is great for insulation, they are beautiful and sustainable, and easy to clean) but the real difference is porosity of amphoras, which mimics oak without flavor more than concrete…</p> <ul> <li><strong>True mico-oxygenation...</strong>Amphoras are made of clay and the newest generation have materials that can be fired at very high temperatures (in a kiln).
