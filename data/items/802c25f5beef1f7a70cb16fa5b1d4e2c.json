  "description": "<p>The Boys Club is a DAO-in-training that is building products, resources, and communities to make the crypto space a more welcome place for women. Crypto has traditionally not been a particularly women-friendly place, with a sub-culture of basement-dwelling libertarian bros. But that is changing.</p> <p>There are an increasing number of ways to break into crypto, and the Boys Club is tackling this head on. Natasha Hoskins and Deana Burke are co-founders of the community, and they note that women have far more presence at IRL crypto events than on the internet. And Boys Club members rep the Boys Club. Hard.</p> <p>With a strong mission, sound goals, and immaculate vibes, the Boys Club have already blazed trails, but there is a strong future ahead of them.</p> <p>------<br /> 📣 ZERION | Trade Across 7 Networks and 500+ protocols<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Zerion\">https://bankless.cc/Zerion</a> </p> <p>------<br /> 🚀 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER:          <a href= \"https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/\">https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/</a> <br />  🎙️ SUBSCRIBE TO PODCAST:                 <a href= \"http://podcast.banklesshq.com/\">http://podcast.banklesshq.com/</a> </p> <p>------<br /> BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS: </p> <p>⚖️ ARBITRUM | SCALING ETHEREUM<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum\">https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum</a> </p> <p>🍵 MATCHA | SMART ORDER ROUTING<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Matcha\">https://bankless.cc/Matcha</a> </p> <p>🚀 SLINGSHOT | LAYER 2 SOCIAL TRADING<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Slingshot\">https://bankless.cc/Slingshot</a> </p> <p>🏦 GEMINI | TURN FIAT INTO CRYPTO<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Gemini\">https://bankless.cc/Gemini</a> </p> <p>🦁 BRAVE | THE BROWSER NATIVE WALLET <br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Brave\">https://bankless.cc/Brave</a> </p> <p>🦄 UNISWAP | DECENTRALIZED FUNDING<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/UniGrants\">https://bankless.cc/UniGrants</a> </p> <p>------<br /> Topics Covered:</p> <p>0:00 Intro<br /> 4:30 Natasha & Deana of Boys Club<br /> 8:52 Onboarding Women Into Web3<br /> 15:56 The Boys Club Vibe<br /> 22:56 But What IS Boys Club?<br /> 26:34 The Name<br /> 28:41 Lessons in Scaling<br /> 33:40 More than Mining<br /> 36:10 What Women Have that Crypto Needs<br /> 40:30 Pet Peeves<br /> 42:42 Interviewing Each Other<br /> 49:14 I Think This Is For You<br /> 52:02 Maximally Successful Boys Club<br /> 56:41 Sharing Stories<br /> 59:28 How to Get Involved</p> <p>------<br /> Resources:</p> <p>Natasha on Twitter<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/natashaghoskins?s=20\">https://twitter.com/natashaghoskins?s=20</a> <br />  Deana on Twitter<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/medeana?s=20\">https://twitter.com/medeana?s=20</a> <br />  Boys Club on Twitter<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/BoysClubCrypto?s=20\">https://twitter.com/BoysClubCrypto?s=20</a> <br />  BoysClub.vip<br /> <a href=\"https://boysclub.vip/\">https://boysclub.vip/</a> </p> <p>-----<br /> Not financial or tax advice.
