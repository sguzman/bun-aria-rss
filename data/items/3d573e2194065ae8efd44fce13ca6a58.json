  "description": "<p>We will be joined by Francisco Batista the Managing Director of Operations for Royal Agio in the Dominican Republic. We will look at the brands the company has to offer and find out the duties of Mr. Batista. We will light up a cigar from The Cigar Authority Care Package made in the Dominican Republic by Royal Agio, the Balmoral Anejo XO Connecticut Rothschild Massivo which measures 5 x 55.</p>\n<p>Throughout the show we will look at Cigar Pairings, no we aren’t talking about liquor to Barry’s disappointment. What will we be pairing? The only way to find out is to tune in and see what we are talking about.</p>\n<p>In the second hour, we will light up a cigar that is made in Nicaragua, but it’s not from a company based in Esteli or Jalapa. The cigar comes from the small town of Grenada, and we share our thoughts on the Patina Habano.</p>\n<p>Tune in to the madness known as The Cigar Authority, the most listened to cigar podcast in the world. We will have all the usual suspects including Versus, Offer of the Day, Cigar News and a peek into the Asylum.</p>\n<p>The Cigar Authority is a member of the United Podcast Network and is recorded live in front of a studio audience at Studio 21 Podcast Cafe upstairs at Two Guys Smoke Shop in Salem, NH and as always you can find many of the cigars we discuss at <a href='http://www.2guyscigars.com/'>http://www.2GuysCigars.com/</a>.</p>\n",
