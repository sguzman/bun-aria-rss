  "description": "<p>OPRAH WINFREY: THE MAP </p>\n<p>How many times have you witnessed someone get close to achieving a goal, only to see it suddenly fall apart? Or they reach the top of the mountain but can’t seem to hold on. Maybe you too have struggled with near-misses and dreams that didn’t quite materialize. Self-sabotage can be a devastating cycle. Oprah believes the variable between winning the race and faltering at the finish line lies with one of the guiding forces in her life: Intention. She says, “Those who sense your truth and your authenticity will rise up to support you. But most importantly you must believe with your whole heart that you are capable of achieving your goal. So first ask yourself <em>Why? What is the real intention? </em>Then ask: <em>How will I execute the action?” </em>In this podcast, Oprah sits down with such legendary spiritual teachers and writers as  Gary Zukav, Gabrielle Bernstein, Brené Brown, Stephen Colbert, David Brooks, President Joe Biden (VP at the time) Marianne Williamson, Daniel Pink, Carole Bayer Sager, Cheryl Strayed, Reverend Michael Beckwith, Meagan Good, Devon Franklin, Janet Mock and Goldie Hawn. They share their own personal trajectories and the inner map they followed which led them to the ultimate fulfillment of their dreams. Interviews with these talented writers, speakers and thought leaders are excerpted from Oprah’s Emmy Award-winning show <em>Super Soul Sunday</em>. You can also find this compilation and other insightful conversations, in Oprah’s best-selling book <em>The Path Made Clear.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n",
