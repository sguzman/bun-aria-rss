  "description": "Did you know that creativity and sexuality are both related to your life force energy? In this episode, I sit down with renowned poet Adam Roa to discuss the creative process. He shares his 4 step approach to creativity and how we can overcome the fear of vulnerability in sharing our story. We then dive into his lessons learned from a 10-year relationship break-up and going to sex camp and how our shame of sexuality keeps us hidden in our creativity. We then discuss some real talk about relationships between spiritual women and men and why sometimes they don’t work. We talk about polyamory and how to know whether it’s right for you. He also shares two powerful poems for us on self love and lessons learned in love.
