  "description": "<p>Motivated by a recent experiment [<a href=\"/abs/2205.05087\">arXiv:2205.05087</a>], we investigate a\npossible mechanism that enhances superconductivity in hole-doped Bernal bilayer\ngraphene due to a proximate WSe$_2$ monolayer. We show that the virtual\ntunneling between WSe$_2$ and Bernal bilayer graphene, which is known to induce\nIsing spin-orbit coupling, can generate an additional attraction between two\nholes, providing a potential explanation for enhancing superconductivity in\nBernal bilayer graphene. Using microscopic interlayer tunneling, we derive the\nIsing spin-orbit coupling and the effective attraction as functions of the\ntwist angle between Bernal bilayer graphene and the WSe$_2$ monolayer. Our\ntheory provides an intuitive and physical explanation for the intertwined\nrelation between Ising spin-orbit coupling and superconductivity enhancement,\nwhich should motivate future studies.\n</p>",
