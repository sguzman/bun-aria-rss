  "description": "Cody headed to Pollock Pines, California for his college summer break.  When he got there, he found that the cabin had been robbed.  He last spoke with his mom on June 6, 2014 right before heading out for a hike.  A massive search began the next day but no trace of Cody has ever been found.  His parents moved to Pollock Pines to search for him and tragically, their home was destroyed in a fire just three months later, on Cody's 24th birthday.  Cody's parents, Vern and Cyndi, shared their story with me for this episode.  \n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
