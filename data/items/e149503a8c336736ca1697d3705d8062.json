Johnson?\n\nWhen the beloved, self-described \"street queen\" of NY's gay ghetto was found floating in the Hudson River in 1992, the NYPD chalked it up as a suicide and refused to investigate.

Dipping deep into jaw-dropping archival footage of another era of New York City life, The Death and Life of Marsha P. Johnson follows as this champion pursues leads, mobilizes officials, and works to tell the story of Marsha's life and get to the bottom of Marsha's death.\n\n[](https://www.truecrimeobsessed.com/see-us-live)\n\n**[COME TO OUR PRIDE SHOW!](https://www.truecrimeobsessed.com/see-us-live) **Come hang with us in NYC on the 50th Anniversary of The Stonewall Riots.
