  "description": "<p>We present an elementary introduction to a new logic for reasoning about\nbehaviors that occur over time. This logic is based on temporal type theory.\nThe syntax of the logic is similar to the usual first-order logic; what differs\nis the notion of truth value. Instead of reasoning about whether formulas are\ntrue or false, our logic reasons about temporal landscapes. A temporal\nlandscape may be thought of as representing the set of durations over which a\nstatement is true. To help understand the practical implications of this\napproach, we give a wide variety of examples where this logic is used to reason\nabout autonomous agents.\n</p>",
