  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, President Trump held a press conference to discuss the latest demands from the Democrats. Given the unreasonable nature and exorbitant dollar amount requested by Congressional negotiators, Trump says he will stick with the executive orders he issued. Then, the left in the media wants you to celebrate what they are calling a historic first presidential ticket. The same party and media that rejected Kamala Harris when she ran for President want you to celebrate what they rejected. Harris could have been the first Black woman running for president, but they chose Joe Biden instead. Despite Harris' criticism of Biden’s' record as a segregationist, Harris now makes the phony claim that she admires Biden. Afterward, Kamala Harris is as progressive as they come and trashes ICE like the rest of them. In a 2018 hearing, Harris grilled an ICE nominee and even went as far as pushing her own perception of ICE as similar to Ku Klux Klan to make her point. Later, teacher's unions are keeping schools closed. If parents are doing the majority of the teaching at home then they should keep the majority of the money they spend on school taxes. Yet, neither Kamala Harris and Joe Biden support school choice which would overwhelmingly benefit communities of color.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
