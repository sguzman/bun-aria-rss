  "title": "Does Software Actually Slow Innovation?",
  "description": "Why have labor and productivity growth slowed?\n\nSoftware entrepreneur-turned-academic researcher, James Bessen, argues the problem isn't fewer productive startups, or M&A activity (which has actually slowed), but big corporations dominating by mastering \"proprietary\" software — the intersection of technology and data — which has had major negative societal consequences. He walks Luigi and Bethany through examples such as IBM, Amazon Web Services, Volkswagen, and more to discuss what's wrong with our current patent system and makes a case for opening up technology, data, and knowledge in order to restore competition.\n\nBessen is the Executive Director of the Technology & Policy Research Initiative at Boston University and his book, \"The New Goliaths: How Corporations Use Software to Dominate Industries, Kill Innovation, and Undermine Regulation\", is out now.",
