  "description": "<p>Sylvan Esso’s Nick Sanborn and Amelia Meath have been making music together since 2013, when Amelia asked Nick, a music producer and bassist, to remix her band Mountain Man’s hit single “Play It Right.” He did, and the rest is history. Sylvan Esso has always had a very sleek, electro-pop feel to their production. Amelia’s powerful voice is front and center, surrounded by harmonies and samples of her own voice. Nick’s genre-destroying bass creates intricate, pulsing grooves for Amelia’s voice to inhabit.</p>\n<p>Now, the married couple and electronic duo have released their fourth studio album, <em data-stringify-type=\"italic\">No Rules Sandy</em>. It’s a follow-up to the band’s Grammy-nominated 2020 album, <em data-stringify-type=\"italic\">Free Love.</em> The new album is a mix of improvisation and experimentation. On today’s episode, Bruce Headlam speaks with Amelia and Nick about their creative process and how <em data-stringify-type=\"italic\">No Rules Sandy</em> came to be. They also play two songs off their new album live.</p>\n<p>You can hear a playlist of some of our favorite Sylvan Esso songs <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7taHpP2RIdwf2Ue3Oa6bdA?si=a5526d2b94f84d25\">HERE</a>.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
