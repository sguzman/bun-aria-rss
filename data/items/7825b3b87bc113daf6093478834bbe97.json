  "description": "David Fajgenbaum, a young, promising medical student, could not have imagined he would become a patient in the same hospital he was serving his residency. After being diagnosed with a very rare illness, he came close to death on multiple occasions. In the throes of one encounter, he promised himself that if he survived, he would make a difference in the fight against this disease. Through his research, he found a drug that he believes has helped him into remission. In the wake of his bouts, he has chosen to live his life \"on overtime,\" time that he is extremely lucky to have, gifting him a unique perspective on living we can all learn from. Fajgenbaum is the Co-Founder and Executive Director of the Castleman Disease Collaborative Network and leads the Castleman Research Program at Penn Medicine. He is the author of Chasing My Cure which details his journey of going from a college athlete, living a healthy life to being diagnosed, and the hurdles he had overcome with love, determination and faith.\nPlug Zone\nActively Moving Forward (AMF):  https://healgrief.org/\nThe Castleman Disease Collaborative Network (CDCN): https://cdcn.org/\nBook: https://chasingmycure.com/\nTwitter: @DavidFajgenbaum\nFacebook: @davidfajgenbaum, https://www.facebook.com/davidfajgenbaum/\n***VOICEMAILS***\nHave a question for Dan?
