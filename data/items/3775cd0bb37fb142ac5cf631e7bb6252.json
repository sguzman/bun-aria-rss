It&#8217;s important in a startup to enable the company to build things and talk to customers. This matters a lot to &#8216;building something people want&#8217;. However, I wanted to talk a bit about a meeting style that I&#8217;ve found that works pretty well, and why it does. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Culture is what you celebrate! And in software I firmly believe we should celebrate product getting out to customers and what we learn. It could be internal customers, it could be that a prototype we shipped &#8211; didn&#8217;t work (this happens often in ML stuff), it could be a hypothesis we invalidated. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Why does this matter?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Well it&#8217;s very easy I think as humans to be scared to show things to get feedback. Let&#8217;s use an analogy &#8211; I&#8217;ve got friends who love music, and create music. But they <strong>don&#8217;t share their art with other people</strong>. This fundamentally stops the feedback loop and means you don&#8217;t actually know if you&#8217;ve made something that people want. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Why does this happen? I think one of the reasons is to protect the ego. It&#8217;s easier to believe that what we&#8217;re working on is great, and it&#8217;s difficult to handle potential rejection. </p>\n\n\n\n<h2>What are the rules of Friday wins?</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>These are evolving as rules but these are the rough rules we have for Friday wins.</p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Focus on </strong><span style=\"font-weight: 600;\">shipping</span> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I think it&#8217;s really important to focus on shipping. Nothing matters until it hits a customer and it&#8217;s very important that shipping is central in your rituals. And shipping is a primary measure of a teams effectiveness and shorter cycle times lead to better feedback, better morale and better learning.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>We even have a picture in our offices devoted to this <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"ðŸ™‚\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> </p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-large\"><img data-attachment-id=\"2424\" data-permalink=\"https://peadarcoyle.com/2020/09/27/friday-wins-celebrating-shipping-and-delivery/whatsapp-image-2020-09-27-at-15-14-48-1/\" data-orig-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/peadarcoyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/WhatsApp-Image-2020-09-27-at-15.14.48-1.jpeg?fit=1600%2C901&ssl=1\" data-orig-size=\"1600,901\" data-comments-opened=\"1\" data-image-meta=\"{\"aperture\":\"0\",\"credit\":\"\",\"camera\":\"\",\"caption\":\"\",\"created_timestamp\":\"0\",\"copyright\":\"\",\"focal_length\":\"0\",\"iso\":\"0\",\"shutter_speed\":\"0\",\"title\":\"\",\"orientation\":\"0\"}\" data-image-title=\"WhatsApp-Image-2020-09-27-at-15.14.48-1\" data-image-description=\"\" data-image-caption=\"\" data-medium-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/peadarcoyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/WhatsApp-Image-2020-09-27-at-15.14.48-1.jpeg?fit=300%2C169&ssl=1\" data-large-file=\"https://i0.wp.com/peadarcoyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/WhatsApp-Image-2020-09-27-at-15.14.48-1.jpeg?fit=730%2C411&ssl=1\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" width=\"730\" height=\"411\" src=\"https://i0.wp.com/peadarcoyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/WhatsApp-Image-2020-09-27-at-15.14.48-1.jpeg?resize=730%2C411&#038;ssl=1\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-2424\" srcset=\"https://i0.wp.com/peadarcoyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/WhatsApp-Image-2020-09-27-at-15.14.48-1.jpeg?resize=1024%2C577&ssl=1 1024w, https://i0.wp.com/peadarcoyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/WhatsApp-Image-2020-09-27-at-15.14.48-1.jpeg?resize=300%2C169&ssl=1 300w, https://i0.wp.com/peadarcoyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/WhatsApp-Image-2020-09-27-at-15.14.48-1.jpeg?resize=768%2C432&ssl=1 768w, https://i0.wp.com/peadarcoyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/WhatsApp-Image-2020-09-27-at-15.14.48-1.jpeg?resize=1536%2C865&ssl=1 1536w, https://i0.wp.com/peadarcoyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/WhatsApp-Image-2020-09-27-at-15.14.48-1.jpeg?resize=900%2C507&ssl=1 900w, https://i0.wp.com/peadarcoyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/WhatsApp-Image-2020-09-27-at-15.14.48-1.jpeg?resize=260%2C146&ssl=1 260w, https://i0.wp.com/peadarcoyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/WhatsApp-Image-2020-09-27-at-15.14.48-1.jpeg?w=1600&ssl=1 1600w, https://i0.wp.com/peadarcoyle.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/09/WhatsApp-Image-2020-09-27-at-15.14.48-1.jpeg?w=1460&ssl=1 1460w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 730px) 100vw, 730px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /><figcaption>Picture from our Barcelona office &#8211; Yes we Ship <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"ðŸ™‚\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> </figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>It&#8217;s an inclusive and high energy meeting</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>It&#8217;s super important that the intern can share their work, it&#8217;s also important that it&#8217;s something people look forward to. When people share on slack during the week &#8211; &#8216;we implemented this feature and it enhanced our process by 10%&#8217; I tell them &#8216;this is great for a Friday win&#8217;. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Not everyone needs to have a win every week &#8211; some teams have longer cadence &#8211; but everyone in the engineering org should be invited and able to participate. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>5 minutes summary &#8211; and focus on the customer</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>This is hard because sometimes things over run &#8211; but I try to make people keep their presentation to 5 minutes. You don&#8217;t need slides &#8211; but try to focus on the most general take home points. And why it is cool. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Sometimes it&#8217;s very apparent that a technology needs a longer talk &#8211; and that&#8217;s ok that can go into a &#8216;tech talk&#8217; meeting which is a longer one and happens every week. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Wins and modern software is cross functional</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>A win is very general as a word. It doesn&#8217;t mean &#8216;this moves the needle of the company in a game changing way&#8217;. Graphs count as wins, UIs count as wins, analysis of customer requests count as wins, a version of an AI model (that is in some version of production &#8211; it can&#8217;t be on someones computer locally) counts as a win. </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>Learning oriented</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>As the CTO of a tech startup, it&#8217;s very important that people in my teams look forward to reviewing their work. Reflection is an important part of the learning cycle &#8211; and a weekly cadence helps with that. For example from last week &#8211; someone said &#8216;we learned this, and a better way to do this is to store our parameters this way&#8217; or &#8216;we built this model and we discovered that the technique doesn&#8217;t work with the amount of data we have&#8217;. These are all VALUABLE contributions to building a great product and help us serve our customers better in the future. Through better product innovation <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"ðŸ™‚\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> </p>\n\n\n\n<p><strong>How software is made is important</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>I firmly believe that since &#8216;software is eating the world&#8217; that all companies are becoming some form of a &#8216;tech company&#8217;. And we see this in the world, in terms of investment &#8211; and in terms of how significant &#8216;tech&#8217; is becoming (for example see the public markets). Therefore if every company is a tech company it&#8217;s very important to build organisational awareness of <em>how software is made</em>. One way we&#8217;ve done this is we invite someone from the commercial side each week, and it&#8217;s good when they give an update on how partnerships, marketing or their speciality is working. This helps a lot with momentum and team spirit. And as a leader &#8211; your job is to build a culture. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>These are some of my comments. I call it &#8216;Friday wins&#8217; because that sounds better than &#8216;sprint demos&#8217; or &#8216;sprint reviews&#8217;. It&#8217;s very important that we celebrate the work we do and how we get stuff out to customers as soon as possible. And I&#8217;ve found in a few weeks of running it, that it&#8217;s great that the knowledge sharing happens. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>Building software is hard &#8211; and modern software is a difficult team sport. To build great software we all need to learn &#8211; largely because it&#8217;s a complex act, and the pace of technological change is very high. </p>\n\n\n\n<p>I firmly believe that the way to do that is to create a learning culture. This meeting is evolving but I wanted to share what we learned so far <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"ðŸ™‚\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> </p>\n\n\n\n<p>What meetings do you have at your company that you want to share? </p>\n\n\n\n<p>If you want to reach out to me to talk about this stuff &#8211; I&#8217;m firstnamelastname@gmail DOT com or you can easily find me on Twitter <img src=\"https://s.w.org/images/core/emoji/14.0.0/72x72/1f642.png\" alt=\"ðŸ™‚\" class=\"wp-smiley\" style=\"height: 1em; max-height: 1em;\" /> </p>\n",
