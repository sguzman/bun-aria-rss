  "description": "<p>DEX, AMM and bonding curve. Again, on this topic. I swear there is a lot of other innovation in the space too, but this week, I want to share something interesting with DEXes and their mathematical mechanism.

Sifchain's rebalancing model for validators and liquidity provider ecosystems &nbsp;</p>\n<p>2. How transaction fees are calculated.
