  "description": "<p>Jenny Owen Youngs is not only a successful musician and songwriter who has worked with some of the biggest artists on the planet, she is also a TV scholar who co-hosts popular podcasts about Buffy The Vampire Slayer and Veronica Mars. In other words, she's the perfect guest for HOW DID WE GET WEIRD? On this episode, Jonah recalls the magical night he attended both Jenny's wedding and MTV Video Music Awards where Vanessa introduced Miley Cyrus' performance, Jenny talks about what it's like living in the lobster roll mecca of Maine and Vanessa does a truly stellar impression of Jenny's collaborator Pitbull that is so uncanny it's difficult to believe Mr. Worldwide is not in the room with us. For our topic, we take a collective deep dive into the popular fantasy/adventure television series \"Xena: Warrior Princess,\" specifically when it comes to the impact it had on a young Jenny Owen Youngs and the pioneering plot twists that have since become hallmarks of the genre. Finally, we play a snack-themed round of\" Change Dot Dork\" and try to guess which unhealthy treat from the past is currently back in rotation at your local grocery store. Enjoy. </p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
