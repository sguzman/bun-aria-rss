  "description": "Senior Bloomberg strategist Mike McGlone believes that Bitcoin (BTC) could crash before hitting a six-figure price in the coming months.\n\nIn a new video interview, McGlone says that the flagship crypto is likely to fall to a key support level of $30,000 before it rallies to a price of $100,000 per coin, a gain of 230%.\n\n“If you buy it [Bitcoin] at around $41,000, I think, maybe in less than a year, you should expect to go around $100,000.\n\nBut at these levels right now, we might easily see $30,000 first. And I fully expect that’s kind of the risk-reward because $30,000 has been the key support.”\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
