  "description": "Since starting this podcast, I have been getting a lot of emails where people ask for advice. I realized it would be more beneficial to answer these questions for others to hear. In this episode I give recommendations on my favorite books, talk about how to deal with negative people and give advice on how to find the best conferences for you to attend. If you want to ask me a question email me - Rob@MWFmotivation.com<p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
