  "description": "Our foremost political playwright and screenwriter joins Matt for a brilliant discussion about creating theatre and film out of politics. Do his shows reflect his own politics? Does he try to be balanced? Why, in This House, choose to write a play about a minority government and the challenges it faced? It's also a discussion about the role of James' background on his art and why growing up in a Nottinghamshire coal mining community shaped the things that he values in politics. Oh, and a bit about having Benedict Cumberbatch play Dominic Cummings...
