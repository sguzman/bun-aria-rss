  "description": "We show theoretically and empirically that the dollar’s status as the global reserve currency\ncan lead to economically significant changes in U.S. money market liquidity. We develop a\nmodel in which U.S. money market spreads respond to foreign central banks’ exchange-rate\nmanagement decisions. Foreign central banks remove liquidity from U.S. money markets and\ncause spreads to widen by selling Treasuries to supply liquidity to their financial systems.\nOur analysis focuses on the major oil exporting countries with fixed exchange rates because\ntheir foreign-exchange market interventions are straightforward to characterize. Our regression analysis shows that shifts in the central banks’ demand for dollar liquidity related to oil\nprice volatility are associated with significantly higher overnight spreads in domestic money\nmarkets. A one-standard deviation increase in the demand for dollar liquidity by a central\nbank in an oil-exporting country leads, on average, to three billion dollars of Treasury sales\nand a two to six basis point increase in U.S. money market spreads. At the same time, deposits\nheld with the Federal Reserve increase in response to this higher oil-price volatility, which is\nconsistent with the model’s predictions. This evidence indicates that the widespread use of the\nU.S. dollar as a reserve currency acts as a channel that can propagate funding shocks from the\nrest of the world to the United States.",
