  "description": "How should we understand markets? In Markets and the Arts of Attachment (Routledge, 2017) Franck Cochoy, Liz McFall, and Joe Deville (from University Toulouse- Jean Jaures,Open University and Lancaster University respectively) bring together essays engaging with the contemporary economic sociology to better explain how markets function. The book is published as part of the Culture, Economy, and the Social (CRESC) book series, and contains a wide range of examples and case studies on how people become ‘attached’ to, and in, markets, and how markets are deeply intertwined with sentiments and emotions. Brands, consumer finance, classic cars, call centres, advertising, dating, watches, and social media are amongst the varied, yet complimentary, set of subjects for this important new collection. The book is essential reading for anyone seeking to better understand the sociology of markets, in particular seeking to move beyond both one dimensional critiques of consumerism and purely economic narratives of market attachments.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
