  "description": "<p>On today’s show, Pat is joined by friend of the show, Bleacher Report OG, and host of the Lefkoe Show, Adam Lefkoe (@AdamLefkoe), live in New York City. They discuss everything that happened in week 5 of the NFL season, including how horrible Alberto Riveron and the rest of the refs have been, which teams are real and which teams are pretenders, what the issues are with the current media landscape, how excessive the overreactions facing certain teams are, who the best punter of all-time is, and what their ideal game shows to commentate would be. Lefkoe also tells people why they should like Chris Simms, despite what the most people may think about him without being familiar with his work, they challenge each other to a weight loss competition over the next few weeks, and tell a few stories (00:59-01:13:09). It’s a good one, come and laugh with us. Cheers.</p>\n",
