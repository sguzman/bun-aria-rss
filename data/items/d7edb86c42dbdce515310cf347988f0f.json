  "description": "On Wednesday’s Mark Levin Show, Larry O’Connor of WMAL fills in for Mark. Chief Justice John Roberts is wrong to tell President Trump that there are no Obama judges. Trump recognizes like any normal American that the 9th Circuit is the most overturned court, and wastes time by coming up with unconstitutional decisions that get smacked down by the Supreme Court. Also, we have so much to be grateful for living in America. People have lost sight that Thanksgiving was created by George Washington to thank God for this country. Later, Larry speaks with Jedidiah Bila about her new book, #DoNotDisturb: How I Ghosted My Cell Phone to Take Back My Life.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
