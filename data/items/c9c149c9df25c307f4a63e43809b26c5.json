  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, Vladimir Putin is a genocidal thug. This program has been clear in explaining why Ukraine is important to America and how specious Russia's claims are.  Despite the minimal support Ukraine has received, their gutsy president and cabinet have remained steadfast in their defense. It's appalling to call yourself a conservative and support Putin. Lamentably, there is a fifth column within the conservative movement who supports Putin, who has clearly declared the U.S as an enemy. Some of them claim to be 'America First', yet none of this occurred during Trump's presidency. Putin has always wanted Ukraine and he's admitted to it. Then, President Biden has placed more sanctions on the American energy industry than he has on Russia's energy industry. The courageous stories of Ukrainians preparing to defend their homes and neighborhoods with homemade Molotov cocktails, rifles, and pistols matter because what happens in Ukraine matters. Churchill once said if the enemy is taking you down, take at least one of them with you. Later, Texas gubernatorial candidate and retired Army Lt. Col. Allen West says that putting the stranglehold on American energy has been painful and we must do the same to Russia. West added that the Democrats' policies are not only destroying our country and US foreign policy but have led to the decay of African American families as well. Afterward, Curtis Sliwa former New York City mayoral candidate joins the show to give his thoughts on Putin.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
