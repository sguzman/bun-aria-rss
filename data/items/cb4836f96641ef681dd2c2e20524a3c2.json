  "description": "<p>How do you find life purpose? How do you challenge self-limiting beliefs about identity and potential? Before you can answer these questions, you must first find your tribe.</p><p>Our instrument for this inward voyage is the voice and prophet of all things action sports,&nbsp;<strong>Selema Masekela</strong>.</p><p>For the uninitiated, Selema cannot be defined as any one thing. He’s a badass surfer, snowboarder and skater. He’s a beloved television commentator and journalist, best known as the face and voice of ESPN’s X-Games, a show he hosted for thirteen years. He’s a filmmaker and Emmy-nominated producer who has collaborated with many a media outlet, including E!, NBC, ABC, NatGeo, RedBull Media and VICE. And he’s a social activist, passionate philanthropist and accomplished musician.</p><p>But more than anything, Selema is a truly gifted storyteller. An extraordinary human with a truly unique and compelling backstory. And a relentlessly curious narrator of the human experience.</p><p>Today we break bread. And let’s just say you’re in for a ride.</p><p>This conversation recounts an extraordinary life well-lived.</p><p>It’s about the confluence and influence of music, art, water, creativity, and storytelling.</p><p>It’s about race and athletics. The progress many industries need to make to truly be accessible and equal to all. And how sport holds the power to break outdated paradigms.</p><p>It’s also about giving voice to passion. Amplifying narratives less well told. And a love affair that spans a diversity of interests—from late night Birdland jazz session to dawn patrol barrels.</p><p>But more than anything, this exchange is about carving out a life that aligns with your passion. It’s about community and the experiences shape who we become. And it’s about connection and the things that make us uniquely human.</p><p>FULL BLOG & SHOW NOTES:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gate.sc/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2Frichroll594&token=3b3c98-1-1660507418841\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/richroll594</a></p><p>YouTube:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gate.sc/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2Fselemamasekela594&token=281f0e-1-1660507418841\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/selemamasekela594</a></p><p>Warning: Selema’s story is one for the ages.</p><p>Peace + Plants,</p><p>Rich</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
