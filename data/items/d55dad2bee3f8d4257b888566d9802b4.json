  "description": "On Wednesday’s Mark Levin show, the constitution is not a libertarian or populist document, as Mike Lee and Rand Paul would like it to be. We shouldn’t interpret the constitution ideologically, we need to attempt to decern what the framers meant at the time. The idea that you need a declaration of war to protect our troops from Iran is absurd. Also, it’s time for a part-time congress because they want to handcuff President Trump in current and future military strikes with a war powers resolution to limit his actions with Iran. Later, thanks to oil companies and our capitalist system we are now energy independent. Now that we are independent democrats are attacking oil again. This time they are creating too much oil and it's affecting our environment and climate change.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
