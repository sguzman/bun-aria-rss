  "description": "<p class=\"p1\"><strong>Is there anything more difficult than not being able to touch, taste or kiss your long-distance partner? Kinkster & Podcaster Dick Wound first suggests mailing each each their dirty socks and tshirts, but when he learns of his new love’s food fetish, they substitute kissing with SweetTarts on Skype, move to in-person and before you know it, she’s lying in a Dexter-style kill room, covered in ice cold pumpkin guts. It’s time to mix the batter! Plus, Dixie struggles with the hardest goodbye she’ll ever face. #ASMR #Sloppy #Squishy #Slippery #Scene</strong></p> <p class=\"p2\"> </p> <p class=\"p3\"><strong>Song: ‘Bon Appetit’ (Katy Perry & Migos)</strong></p> <p class=\"p1\"><strong><em>About the Storyteller:</em></strong></p> <p class=\"p2\"> </p> <p class=\"p1\"><strong>Dick Wound explores darker and more unusual kinks and fetishes on his podcast, Off the Cuffs, including fantasies of his own death, being dominated by robots, and seductive alien encounters. The podcast was established to document his journey into the kink community, but little time passed before Dick began receiving feedback from listeners and it quickly became evident that many needed guidance to begin their journey. The platform Dick has created brings together both newbies and long time kinksters, and enables them to share their stories and experiences with a worldwide audience. This has led to guest appearances on other podcasts including RISK!, This is Actually Happening, The Dildorks and dozens of others. Dick also operates and produces a second podcast, Being There, where the extraordinary aspects of everyday people’s lives are explored in a free form interview/story-telling format. Dick’s personal journey is an interesting one, and he is available to speak on the subjects of kink and BDSM with an open mind and devious sense of humor.</strong></p> <p class=\"p2\"> </p> <p class=\"p1\"><strong>You can learn more about Dick Wound at<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></strong></p> <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href= \"https://www.offthecuffs.org/\"><strong>https://www.offthecuffs.org/</strong></a></span></p> <p class=\"p1\"><strong>&</strong></p> <p class=\"p1\"><strong>Patreon.com/OCPKink</strong></p> <p class=\"p4\"> </p> <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Episode links:</strong></span></p> <p class=\"p2\"> </p> <p class=\"p1\"><span class=\"s1\"><strong>Saying goodbye to Quake, the World’s Best Dog</strong></span><strong>: If you wanna help with Quake’s final Veterinary and End of Life expenses, the GoFundMe is at<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></strong></p> <p class=\"p2\"> </p> <p class=\"p1\"><strong>https://bit.ly/QuakeTheSaint</strong></p> <p class=\"p2\"> </p> <p class=\"p1\"><strong>And Thank you for loving my Best Boi <3</strong></p> <p class=\"p2\"> </p> <p class=\"p1\"><span class= \"s1\"><strong>Uberlube</strong></span><strong>: Uberlube is a luxurious, high-grade silicone lubricant made from clean, body-friendly ingredients; it’s just silicone with a little Vitamin E.
