  "description": "<p>Three stories from Japan about love gone wrong. On the first, the fairest youth in all the land is set to marry the daughter of a rich noble. The problem? His father kind of oversold his looks... On the second, we'll see why moths and other nighttime bugs go toward the light, and on the third, a lovelorn samurai meets a woman from his past he thought was long gone.</p>\n<p>The creature just wants you to chill out and stop trying to kill its friends...or else it will make you swell up in horrifying and painful places.</p>\n<p>--</p>\n<p>Fictional this week is a prescient sci-fi tale of isolation and redemption.
