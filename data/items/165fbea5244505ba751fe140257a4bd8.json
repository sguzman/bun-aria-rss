  "description": "<p>Tonight I will be speaking to a witness from SE Oklahoma. There is a long family history of sightings. The guest will be sharing some of the encounters from his family as well as his own encounters. I will be having this guest back for a part two, otherwise this might be a 4 hour show tonight.</p> <p>One of the encounters that really interested me was when the guest was a teenager and he came face to face with a Sasquatch. Here is a small portion of that encounter:</p> <p> </p> <p><em>“I put the gun to my shoulder and took aim, I was on it and it looked almost surprised, its eyes got big and it just froze in place.</em></p> <p><em>I know it looked me right in the eyes, I said you better say something I am not kidding man you better say something or ill put one in you. Fight or flight kicked in and I wasn’t running.</em></p> <p><em>Its put it’s arms out to its side palms towards me and then let out a deep grumble like you hear a lion on tv do before it gets in a fight then from a grumble to a roar that shook my insides and I was still focused on it in the scope, I put one of those cci stingers right in its throat and it jerked and jumped real fast back to the sycamore then I could hear coughing a bit and just when I thought it was over it really wasn’t.”</em></p>",
