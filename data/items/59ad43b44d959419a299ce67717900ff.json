  "description": "<p>The super talented and friend Kate Berlant graces us with her charming whit on the podcast. You may know Kate from her work on \"Netflix: The Characters\" and the film \"555\". We discuss her origins such as going to an all girls school, being the president of the Thespian Society (or Vice President?) and doing stand-up in the New York comedy scene. We take a trip down memory lane discussing AOL chat rooms allowing us to be \"someone else\" behind a screen and trolling people in chat rooms, especially when it comes to music taste. We play the segment \"change.dork\" and look at the petitions ranging from food centric to showing compassion towards sitcom actors. </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
