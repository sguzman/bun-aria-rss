  "description": "We all go through difficulties and things in life that we don’t understand. It’s easy to get discouraged and think, “Why is this happening to me?” But God uses difficulties to move us toward our destiny. Let Joel show you how nothing happens in life by accident. You may not understand it, but God wouldn’t have allowed it if it wasn’t going to work to your advantage. God is not going to stop every difficulty if there is purpose for it. But Psalm 89 promises us that He will steady us and make us strong.
