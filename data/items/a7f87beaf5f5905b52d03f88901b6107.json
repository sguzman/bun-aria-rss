When we are falling in love we experience an increase in cortisol, the stress hormone, but studies show that when we develop an attachment to someone oxytocin can actually work to inhibit cortisol production and stress response. That’s why researchers say that true love probably begins when the hormonal cocktail stops working. <br>\n<br>\nSo long story short maybe the loss of passion in our sex life as we know it, is not such a bad thing<br>\n<br>\nMeet the guests of this episode!!!<br>\n<br>\nKevin Fredericks aka KevOn Stage is an actor, stand-up comedian, entrepreneur, podcast developer and host and filmmaker.
