  "description": "Today we talk about one of the hardest working rooms in the house, the mud room. A space that sees all the comings and goings in the household and is your entry & exit. There are a few tricks to organizing this space and contain the mess.  Start with a large format tile floor with a walk off mat on the garage side and a nicer rug inside the house.  We suggest using plenty of hooks so you don't overload them and putting them above your bench where it will become difficult to sit down.  Be sure to include drawers to contain the mess and some open shelves where you can have easy access to the things that come and go often.  If you include lockers,  they should be wide to avoid things getting shoved in there, and being difficult to remove.  A great trick is to include a mirror to check yourself on your way in and out, highlighted with a great light fixture.  Give this room good light because inevitably it’s a place you're going to be searching for stuff. <br /><br />The ground floor 2:51<br />Storage 9:05<br />Hooks 15:15<br />Depth and width 24:34<br /><br />“We love a playful tile and so this is a way to not just kind of phone it in and get a beige porcelain tile. I always think of a gas station, that’s generally what they’re going to use is something that’s like a fake travertine… I have a natural limestone in two different colors and I’ve made a playful pattern out of it. Large format is going to be your friend because you’re gonna have less grout joints that you have to try and scrub all that soccer cleat mud out of.” 8:13<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
