The courageous act of resistance that took place over the course of several days in 1969 is widely perceived as the catalyst to the modern LGBTQ+ liberation movement in the United States.\n\nAs Pride month reaches an exuberant crescendo this weekend with World Pride in NYC, an event that’s one part party, one part protest, questions about the trajectory, priorities, and composition of the movement persist, including how to best foreground the lives and concerns of members of the LGBTQ+ community whose experience is filtered through the interstices of more than one form of oppression.\n\nOn this episode of Intersectionality Matters, host Kimberlé Crenshaw ponders these questions with two of the movement’s torchbearers: Barbara Smith, trailblazing Black feminist critic and co-founder of the Combahee River Collective, and Phyll Opoku-Gyimah, also known as Lady Phyll, co-founder and executive director of UK Black Pride. Tune in for their fascinating insights on living in the overlapping margins of race, gender and sexuality, the future of LGBTQ activism and their commitments to retrieving the experiences of queer Black women from a location that resists telling.\n\nHosted by Kimberlé Crenshaw (@sandylocks)\nProduced and edited by Julia Sharpe Levine\nRecorded by Elizabeth Press, the Sanctuary for Independent Media, and Michael Kramer\nMusic by Blue Dot Sessions\nWith: Lady Phyll (@msladyphyll), Barbara Smith (@thebarbarasmith), and the Reclaim Pride Coalition (Colin Ashley, Robert Baez, Francesca Barjon) (@queermarch)\nIntersectionality Matters: ig: @intersectionalitymatters, twitter: @IMKC_podcast\nAdditional support from G'Ra Asim, Naimah Hakim, Madeline Cameron Wardleworth, Peter Gaber, Ezra Young\n\n~~~\nNYC Trans Day of Action \nFriday, June 28 from 4-6pm: https://alp.org/events/15th-annual-trans-day-action\nNYC Dyke March \nSaturday, June 29 from 5-8pm: https://www.nycdykemarch.com/\nQueer Liberation March\nSunday, June 30 from 9:30-3pm: https://reclaimpridenyc.org/\nWorld Pride Parade\nSunday, June 30 at 12pm: https://2019-worldpride-stonewall50.nycpride.org/\nUK Black Pride\nSaturday, July 7 at 12pm: https://www.ukblackpride.org.uk/",
