  "title": "Repost: How to spot a bogus minimum wage study (with Ben Zipperer)",
  "description": "Here’s another resource from the archive that will help you wade through the loud and often misleading coverage of the Raise the Wage Act. \n\nNot all minimum-wage studies are equal. Some of the most headline-grabbing negative reports on the effects of the minimum wage were commissioned and promoted by right-wing organizations looking to legitimize trickle-down policies that hurt workers. How can you spot studies that aren’t worth their salt? Economist Ben Zipperer joins Nick and Jasmin to reveal some of the tricks that economists pull, and to help us understand how some studies can conclude that raising wages will kill jobs—even though, as we know, the opposite is true. \n\nBen Zipperer is an economist at the Economic Policy Institute. His areas of expertise include the minimum wage, inequality, and low-wage labor markets. He has published research in the Industrial and Labor Relations Review and has been quoted in outlets such as The New York Times, The Washington Post, Bloomberg, and the BBC. \n\nTwitter: @benzipperer, @EconomicPolicy\n\nShow us some love by leaving a rating or a review!
