  "description": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">We’re so thrilled to be talking morality chain romance! We’ve owed this episode to Katee Robert for nearly a year, and we have no excuses for how long this has taken, except that time in 2020 was a flat circle. Here, we get down to business—we tackle the definition of Morality Chain, and how it differs from Dark Romance, how it connects with mafia, criminals, pirates, highwaymen, and the original Alpha. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Check all your Content Warnings before you begin with these books!</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>S03.31: Morality Chain Romance Interstitial</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Whether you're new to Fated Mates this month or have been with us for all three seasons, we adore you, and we're so grateful to have you. We hope you’re reading the best books this week.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Next week, we’re reading Alexis Daria’s You Had Me At Hola, one of our Best Books of 2020! Find it at <a href=\"https://amzn.to/39rwpdB\">Amazon</a>, <a href=\"https://www.barnesandnoble.com/w/you-had-me-at-hola-alexis-daria/1133982946?ean=9780062959935\">Barnes & Noble</a>, <a href=\"https://www.kobo.com/us/en/ebook/you-had-me-at-hola-1\">Kobo</a>, or <a href=\"https://books.apple.com/us/book/you-had-me-at-hola/id1482614303?ct=books_you_had_me_at_hola&itscg=30200&itsct=books_toolbox&ls=1\">Apple Books</a>.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Show Notes</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">One very important note: we highly recommend doing a thorough search for content warnings for all the books and movies we mention this week.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">We love&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.kateerobert.com/\">Katee Robert</a>, who we had on as a guest for the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2020/11/16/s0315-menage-romance-interstitial-with-katee-robert\">menage interstitial</a>. Katee bid on this item at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://kennedyryanwrites.com/\">Kennedy Ryan</a>’s Lift 4 Autism auction. It happens every spring, so&nbsp;<a href=\"http://lift4autism.com/tag/kennedy-ryan/\">keep an eye on this page for the 2021 auction</a>&nbsp;if you’d like to pick the topic for a future interstitial.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This week, Katee released&nbsp;<a href=\"https://amzn.to/3cf2zuD\"><em>Seducing My Guardian</em></a>, the 4th book in her SUPER HOT Touch of Taboo series. If you'd like to read a morality chain romance written by Katee, we recommend&nbsp;<a href=\"https://amzn.to/2QCeUAJ\"><em>The Bastard's Bargain</em></a>.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><a href=\"https://www.poetryfoundation.org/poems/50259/song-it-was-a-lover-and-his-lass\">“In springtime, the only pretty ring time”</a>&nbsp;is from Shakespeare’s&nbsp;<em>As You Like It</em>. It's also possible Sarah knows it from&nbsp;<em>Willy Wonka and the Chocolate Factory</em>. She would like you to believe that it's from the former, but we'll leave you to draw your own conclusions. Either way,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/4m1EFMoRFvY\">“If you liked it then you shoulda put a ring on it,”</a>&nbsp;is from Beyonce.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">As it turns out,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://drive.google.com/file/d/1AvG3weBETcwAe-KPmOjFThgc3gPpIWft/view?usp=sharing\">Chicago is a great town for beach volleyball.</a></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">It’s hard not to talk about morality chain & dark romance together, but we think they are inverse tropes. The internet definition of&nbsp;<a href=\"https://allthetropes.fandom.com/wiki/Morality_Chain\">Morality Chain</a>&nbsp;is “is a character who is the reason another character is Good.” Jen and Sarah’s current definition is that in morality chain romance, the Love Interest pulls a hero towards humanity and goodness, while in dark romance, the love interest is pulled down into the hero’s lawless world.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Some examples in pop culture are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://buffy.fandom.com/wiki/Spike\">Spike from&nbsp;<em>Buffy</em></a>&nbsp;and maybe&nbsp;<a href=\"https://how-i-met-your-mother.fandom.com/wiki/Barney_Stinson\">Barney in&nbsp;<em>How I Met Your Mother</em></a>r. Also, check out a movie called&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/L%C3%A9on:_The_Professional\"><em>The Professional</em></a>, where a child (played by Natalie Portman!) befriends the assassin next door. The Jason Statham one with a kid is called&nbsp;<em>Safe</em>.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Hero%27s_journey\">The Hero’s Journey</a>&nbsp;is very common character archetype in literature and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://venngage.com/blog/heros-journey/\">pop culture</a>, but Sarah and Jen are both very taken with Gail Carriger’s description of the alternative archetype,&nbsp;<em>The Heroine’s Journey</em>.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">If you want more about morality chain, so many of Kresley’s books from The Immortals After Dark series will work,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fatedmates.net/the-books\">so please listen to season one!</a>&nbsp;Our favorites are&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2018/11/28/4-something-we-said-dark-needs-at-nights-edge\"><em>Dark Needs at Night’s Edge</em></a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2019/4/8/11-lothaire\"><em>Lothaire</em></a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2019/6/27/16-sweet-ruin\"><em>Sweet Ruin</em></a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">We were divided on whether the character has to be a danger to others in order to qualitfy as morality chain. In the Gamemaker series:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2019/4/22/13-the-professional\"><em>The Professional</em></a>&nbsp;is about an assassin who is a danger to others, while in&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2019/6/27/17-the-player\"><em>The Player</em></a>&nbsp;he’s only a danger to himself.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/JenniferRNN/status/962804770116321280?s=20\">Jen Porter wrote a long thread about what she thinks of as PEA</a>, or problematic ever after, romance.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Mickey is \"kind of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Fagin\">Fagin</a>-y\" as a character, but without the antisemitism. In interesting historical facts, Dickens rewrote&nbsp;<em>Oliver Twist</em>&nbsp;later in life to remove all anti-Semitic characteristics from Fagin, after he'd been criticized for the portrayal of the character. Of course, it's not that simple.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.jstor.org/stable/41307849\">Read more about it from Deborah Epstein Nord</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><a href=\"https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2020/1/20/s0220-managed-by-kristen-callihan\">Scottie is the main character of&nbsp;<em>Managed</em></a>, and is classified more as&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RomanceBooks/comments/jfbxp0/grumpysunshine/\">grumpy one/sunshine one</a>, which we argue is just morality chain dialed down.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">More about how most writers have a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://storygrid.com/discover-storys-core/\">“core story.\"</a></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Next week, we'll be reading&nbsp;<a href=\"https://amzn.to/2PmCeBw\"><em>You Had me at Hola</em></a>&nbsp;by Alexis Daria</p>",
