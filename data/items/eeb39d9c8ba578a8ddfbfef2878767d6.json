And today, that's a good thing. First,&nbsp;Kílian Jornet — one of the most humble, accomplished and inspiring athletes in the world —&nbsp;rarely sits for long form press. Second, this hero lives up to the hype. And this conversation is everything I hoped it would be.</p><p>For the uninitiated,&nbsp;Kílian Jornet is inarguably&nbsp;the&nbsp;most prolific and dominant&nbsp;mountain runner of all time and amongst the world's greatest athletes, period. Born and raised at 6,000 feet above sea level in the Spanish Pyrenees, at age 5 he climbed an 11,000 foot mountain — the highest mountain in the region. Now Jornet adores the mountains with the same ferocity with which he runs them. Racking up&nbsp;wins in most of the world's premier ultramarathons, his many accomplishments&nbsp;include:</p><br><p>* 4x champion of Europe’s Skyrunner World Series;</p><p>* 3x&nbsp;champion of the grueling Ultra-Trail du Mont-Blanc;</p><p>* 2011 winner, Western States 100; and</p><p>* 4x consecutive winner, Hardrock 100; and</p><p>* 2017 winner at Hardrock 100 despite dislocating his shoulder at mile 14</p><br><p>In search of inspiration outside formal competition, Kílian embarked on a self-styled adventure project dubbed&nbsp;Summits of My Life — establishing the&nbsp;fastest known recorded times (“FKT”) to ascend and descend the world's most challenging peaks, including the Matterhorn, Kilimanjaro, Mont Blanc, Denali and even the planet's tallest summit. Not only did Kílian set the Mt. Everest FKT at 26 hours from base camp, he did it without supplemental oxygen or ropes. A mere six days later, he repeated the performance — an accomplishment that&nbsp;inspired&nbsp;Adventurer of the Year accolades from National Geographic.</p><br><p>Kílian's feats of poetic athletic prowess are beautifully depicted in his gripping memoir <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B00FGD8XVO/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ricroloffweb-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=B00FGD8XVO&linkId=f0428d66c7161b466cad56e7c6e374dc\" target=\"_blank\">Run Or Die*,</a>&nbsp;the new documentary <a href=\"https://everest.summitsofmylife.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Path To Everest,</a>&nbsp;and his latest book <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1937715906/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ricroloffweb-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=1937715906&linkId=1d76bad37c0ba9749e4dafe52ce8d0d0\" target=\"_blank\">Summits of My Life</a>*&nbsp;— all of which I urge you to check out.</p><p>Today he shares his remarkable story.

Kílian's&nbsp;motivation isn't what you might imagine. It has nothing to do with race results. And his happiness derives not from victory. Instead, it's adventure that sparks Kílian's joy.
