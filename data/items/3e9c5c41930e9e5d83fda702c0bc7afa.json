Kevin DeYoung, Justin Taylor, and Collin Hansen sit down together to discuss their summer reading lists, how to balance the need for safety and the need to trust God's sovereignty in the pandemic, Grace Community Church and their choice to gather indoors for services in California, and should the Big 10 have canceled?This episode is brought to you by <a href=\"https://www.crossway.org/\">Crossway</a>. As Kevin says on this episode, \"There are lots of Christian publishers, but with Crossway, you know that you have men and women working there who care very much about the content about the truth of God's word, not just selling books—every book publisher has to sell some books but—more importantly, they want to edify and build up the church.\"</p>\n<p> In particular, we want to highlight the book by Dane Ortlund, '<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Gentle-Lowly-Christ-Sinners-Sufferers/dp/1433566133\">Gentle and Lowly: The Heart of Christ for Sinners and Sufferers</a>.'
