  "description": "<p>Anharmonicity plays important roles in distant areas, in classical mechanics\nin which it exhibits renormalization of the bare frequency, and in statistical\nmechanics in which the simplest situation is that it causes a correction to the\nvibrational contribution of the heat capacity of an ideal gas composed of\ndiatomic molecules, and in $ {\\phi}^4 $ model in quantum field theory and\nvarious anharmonic effects in condensed matter physics, etc. A novel two-to-one\ncorrespondence is identified from the renormalized frequencies of anharmonic\noscillations in diatomic molecules to the heat capacity corrections for an\nideal gas of the diatomic molecules. When the frequency and the heat capacity\nare expressed in perturbative series, respective, in terms of the\ncharacteristic quantities in mechanics and thermal physics, the expansion\ncoefficients are essentially defined by the renormalization of the bare\nfrequency, and two expansion coefficients in former corresponds to one in the\nlatter.\n</p>",
