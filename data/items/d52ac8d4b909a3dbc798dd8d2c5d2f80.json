    "media:description": "Incident management is inherently stressful and is made worse when the diagnostics and observability data is lacking and heterogeneous. Lyft runs Envoy at every hop of the network providing best in class observability across the entirety of Lyft’s network topology. Homogenous data reduces the time it takes to identify production issues. This talk will introduce Envoy, how Lyft configures Envoy and simulate a production incident at Lyft. Attendees are guided from the dreaded notification of an issue in production to resolution, by showing how engineers use Envoy’s extensive observability to identify and root cause the incident and remedy the situation.",
