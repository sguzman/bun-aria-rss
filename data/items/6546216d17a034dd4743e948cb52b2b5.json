  "description": "<p>As someone who recently started cheesemaking, I can very much verify that cheesemaking is most definitely an art form. Today I'm thrilled to be joined by a master of her craft, Robyn Jackson from Cheesemaking from Scratch. In today's episode, Robyn describes what supplies you need to get started, how to determine what cheese press to buy, the difference between freeze-dried and natural cultures, and much more. Robyn also discusses the best cheeses for every beginner and which ones to make first.</p><p>Connect further with Robyn below:<br/>Instagram: <a href='https://www.instagram.com/cheese_from_scratch_/'>https://www.instagram.com/cheese_from_scratch_/</a><br/>Website: <a href='https://cheesefromscratch.com/'>https://cheesefromscratch.com/</a></p><p>This episode is brought to you by Redmond’s Real Salt, which is the #1 salt I use in all my homesteading cooking, canning, and fermentation. I have learned over the years that not all salt is created equal and having the good stuff really does make a difference in your culinary adventures. Redmond’s is the only salt mined in the good ol’ US of A. I love that it’s mined using sustainable practices AND contains 60+ trace minerals that not only make it incredibly good for you, but it tastes better too. Since I can’t grow salt myself (obviously) Right now, Redmond's is offering 15% off your entire order just for my podcast listeners.
