I pride myself on not being a but guy (no double meaning intended). The buts that I hear the most are \"I didn't have any money\", \"I didn't have a chance\", \"I grew up in a poor neighborhood\", \"I didn't have a mentor\". People are loaded with buts in life; that's why the majority of people fall into a standard life. </div>\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8000001907349px;\"> </div>\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8000001907349px;\">For me personally, my \"but\" is usually that I love the process and the climb.

You could be born in a part of the world where there is a dictator or communism. Do I think it's easy as to be a female entrepreneur in the Middle East as it is to be in New York City? No. Of course not. Just like any white male born in a semi affluent environment is bound to have a leg up on minorities in poor communities. </div>\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8000001907349px;\"> </div>\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8000001907349px;\">But there is a flipside to this. The hustle that you get from coming from the grind is a huge advantage. Some people think you're dead on impact, that you have to stick with the restrictions you're born in; that if you're born into a bad situation, you're bound to fail. But I think being born into luxury is worse because everything comes so easy and you don't know how to get anything.</div>\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8000001907349px;\"> </div>\n<div style=\"color: rgb(34, 34, 34); font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 12.8000001907349px;\">It all comes down to how you operate and how you look at the world. But I will tell you this: I hate excuses. I hate them with all my heart. When something is wrong with VaynerMedia, that's all on me. I love taking that blame and not passing the buck. I take pride in taking the blame.
