  "description": "Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the planet Saturn with its rings of ice and rock and over 60 moons. In 1610, Galileo used an early telescope to observe Saturn, one of the brightest points in the night sky, but could not make sense of what he saw: perhaps two large moons on either side. When he looked a few years later, those supposed moons had disappeared. It was another forty years before Dutch scientist Christiaan Huygens solved the mystery, realizing the moons were really a system of rings. Successive astronomers added more detail, with the greatest leaps forward in the last forty years. The Pioneer 11 spacecraft and two Voyager missions have flown by, sending back the first close-up images, and Cassini is still there, in orbit, confirming Saturn, with its rings and many moons, as one of the most intriguing and beautiful planets in our Solar System. \n\nWith\n\nCarolin Crawford\nPublic Astronomer at the Institute of Astronomy and Fellow of Emmanuel College, University of Cambridge\n\nMichele Dougherty\nProfessor of Space Physics at Imperial College London\n\nAnd\n\nAndrew Coates\nDeputy Director in charge of the Solar System at the Mullard Space Science Laboratory at UCL.",
