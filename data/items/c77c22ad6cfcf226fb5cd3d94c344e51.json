  "description": "<p>In Detroit, Michigan sits a grand home with a gabled roof, arched windows and a beautiful rose hue emanates from the facade. This upscale dining establishment was once the David Whitney House and is known today simply as The Whitney.  David Whitney, Jr. was such a successful lumber baron that people would remark that he was \"the man who could out-lumber Paul Bunyan.\" He was one of the wealthiest men in America and he would leave his mark in Detroit in a very positive way. Some believe he remains in the home he had built in the afterlife. They seems to be other spirits at The Whitney as well. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of The Whitney! The Moment in Oddity was suggested by listener Teresa Slaven and features the Mortuary Railroad Station and This Day in History is by Richard Schaffer and features Pierre Barrière's Attempt to Assassinate King Henry IV of France.
