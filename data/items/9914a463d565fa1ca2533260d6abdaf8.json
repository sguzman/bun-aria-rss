  "description": "<p>This week we're breaking down Take Your Daughter To Work Day, so let's keep it G-rated, okay? The ladies give some background info about all the child actors on set that day and chat about Stanley's daughter flirting with Ryan, and Pam's struggle to befriend just one kid. Then the ladies give history lessons on Shaggy Peter and the Green Sleeves song that ends in a fun revelation, and we get an update on Game of Thrones. Finally, we discuss Brunetti's Pizza, and hit up Kentapedia (Kent Zbornak) for the low-down on that Fundle Bundle video. Now the kids have left, you can now safely go back to being your HBO No Limits-selves. </p>\n",
