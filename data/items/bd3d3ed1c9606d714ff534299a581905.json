  "description": "Academics don’t pay enough attention to class. And when we do, too often we only magnify the tendency for working class subjects to be defined according to middle class norms; and according to those norms, they, not surprisingly, fail in one way or another, justifying their position beneath the middle class. There are many unfortunate consequences of this dynamic. Among them, we seldom see what’s really happening in, say, the performance of a country song.\nNadine Hubbs, Professor of Music Theory and Women’s Studies at the University of Michigan, is an exception to this rule. In Rednecks, Queers, and Country Music (University of California Press, 2014), she discusses subjects that range from a Foo Fighters tour-promotion video, the role of taste in class distinction, and the blinders that members of the middle class seem to wear when they notice working-class culture. Then she removes the blinders and takes a look at some country, noticing an artistic richness and political agenda that academics and critics seldom see. Along the way, she investigates a few of the prominent assumptions about country–its bigotry and political conservatism, for example. She discusses research that undermines these assumptions, noting the work they do to maintain class distinctions and privilege. And finally she makes the case for paying more attention to class, working-class culture, suggesting the potential for real political collaboration between the working and the middle classes.\nHere are some of the videos mentioned in the interview:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=vsrqw0oElHQ\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=6e5hRLbCaCs\nhttp://www.gretchenwilson.com/media/videos/41683/56793\nLearn more about your ad choices.
