  "title": "Texting Tutor PT 1: She Wants To Have Lunch With Her Ex-Boyfriends New Wife?!",
  "description": "Lane and her ex-boyfriend Tod became platonic friends after their relationship ended; shortly after he got married to a woman named Trish.\nNow, the issue isn’t that he got married to Trish or that he even got married at all; the issue is that all of her friends and everyone around her is married and she can’t seem to hold onto a relationship for longer than six months.\nShe reached out to The Bert Show because she wanted our help asking Trish to go out to lunch with her, not to hang out and be friends but to pick her brain about what she did to get married.\nThe Bert Show, however, didn’t think that it was necessary for Lane to meet Trish for lunch and all agreed that it wouldn’t end well.\nCassie encouraged Lane to take a moment and enjoy her singleness “You’re not broken just because you’re single, and just because you’ve had a lot of relationships that haven’t manifested into marriages.”\nTiming is a major topic often discussed on The Bert Show, and to Bert, there’s nothing wrong with Lane, she just hasn’t met the right person and it’s just not the right time. “If you want us to text and try to get you this lunch we can do that, I just think all of us in here don’t think it’s really going to accomplish what you want, and frankly I just think that right dude hasn’t come along yet and chances are you’re not doing anything and if you are, you’re not gonna get that from the ex-boyfriend’s new wife.”\nSo, instead of doing Texting Tutor for Lane, The Bert Show asked her a few questions about herself and encouraged interested listeners to reach out for a date with Lane.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
