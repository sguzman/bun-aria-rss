  "description": "<p>Albert Einstein is credited with saying, “We cannot solve problems with the same thinking we used when we created them.” Today, I want to apply that sentiment to the pandemic that our society is facing. As we seek solutions to a public health crisis, it’s important that we take a deeper look at the contributing factors that got us to this level of distress.</p> <p>On this episode of The Model Health Show, we’re diving deep into the pieces of our country’s health crisis that are not being analyzed. You’ll learn about some of the underlying health epidemics that have made our population more susceptible to the pandemic.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p>Most importantly, you’re going to hear about how to use this time as an opportunity for change, and how understanding the root cause of our issues can lead us to a better, stronger, healthier way of life. My intent is that this episode inspires you to take action and make a difference on an individual, grassroots level so that together we can affect lasting change.
