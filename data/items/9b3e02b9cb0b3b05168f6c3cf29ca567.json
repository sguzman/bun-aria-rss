  "description": "<p>The real unit interval is the fundamental building block for many branches of\nmathematics like probability theory, measure theory, convex sets and homotopy\ntheory. However, a priori the unit interval could be considered an arbitrary\nchoice and one can wonder if there is some more canonical way in which the unit\ninterval can be constructed. In this paper we find such a construction by using\nthe theory of effect algebras. We show that the real unit interval is the\nunique non-initial, non-final irreducible algebra of a particular monad on the\ncategory of bounded posets. The algebras of this monad carry an order,\nmultiplication, addition and complement, and as such model much of the\noperations we need to do on probabilities. On a technical level, we show that\nboth the categories of omega-complete effect algebras as well as that of\nomega-complete effect monoids are monadic over the category of bounded posets\nusing Beck's monadicity theorem. The characterisation of the real unit interval\nthen follows easily using a recent representation theorem for omega-complete\neffect monoids.\n</p>",
