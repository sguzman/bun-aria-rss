Ruggiero works a number of the biggest brands in sports, and discusses not only how teams should be using technology to reach fans during lockdowns, but also how they can use the quiet period to ready their stadiums or arenas for the new reality once sports resume. That includes a thorny discussion that's likely to arise over privacy, as teams and leagues think about what's needed to secure the health and safety of fans in their buildings. A four-time Olympian and former IOC member, Ruggiero also discusses the postponement of the 2020 Summer Games, how athletes helped drive that discussion and the viability of the games taking place next summer in Tokyo.</p><p>Hosts: Eben Novy-Williams, Michael Barr, Mike Lynch</p><p>Producer: Charlie Vollmer</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
