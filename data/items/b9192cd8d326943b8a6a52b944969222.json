  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, the culture of the ruling class puts blame on 'the system' instead of individuals taking responsibility for their own actions. Congress just passed a law preventing 18-21-year-olds from buying certain weapons and it didn't matter in the case of the Highland Park, IL shooting on July 4th because the real issue is cultural decay. The Highland shooter had run-ins with police including a suicide threat yet he purchased the rifle anyway to go on a killing spree. The media and gun critics stand up as if they have some sort of moral superiority and they blame law-abiding citizens and firearms for the actions of sick, hateful, mentally ill individuals. The ruling class has failed this nation but demands more power instead of less. Then, for the past 33 years National Public Radio (NPR) has read the Bill of Rights in honor of America's birthday, but this year they scrapped that tradition for an 11-minute conversation on 'equality.' Later, Nancy Pelosi continues to abuse her authority as Speaker of the House. Pelosi and the Democrats have no intention of publicly accepting testimony from the five witnesses that know that Donald Trump authorized 20,000 National Guard troops. The entire purpose of this committee is to criminalize Trump and his politics - this is not Constitutional. Pelosi, Liz Cheney, and the whole circus should be questioned under oath as to what they know about all of this. We already know what actions Trump took and none of them were crimes. Finally, President Martin Van Buren has been considered the real founder of the modern democrat party and there are similarities between then and now.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
