  "description": "Hey HBs! We're here this gorgeous Veterans Day with Prince Joe by Suzanne Brockmann! When terrorists Digiorno and Sausalito decide to assassinate a Prince, he needs his American Doppleganger, a Navy Seal, to impersonate him. Luckily, he has a high class, dancing, media consultant who can turn this wrong-side-of-the-tracks guy into Royalty. Or something. Begrudging association becomes steamy bed play! And then LOVE!! \n Bonus Content: \n Erin's spectacular mom reads romance now!, we're stoked for ACOWAR, Jordan Catalano, teeny tiny sleeps, Erin's favorite version of Showgirls with crazy cartoon bikinis covering the T&A and goofily-dubbed cursing, *Bing Boong Bong* SO MANY THINGS with Erin, nipple lapels, bearing down, head hopping (discussed a bit in this episode of  Fated Mates), something called a \"chopter,\" and so much more! \n Lady Loves:\n Melody: bras that fit. Get them on your body. Erin endorses the Spanx Pillow Cup Signature Pushup Plunge Bra. It's got memory foam cups! \n Erin: one that note, pants that fit! High-waisted Madewell are awesome! \n Episode Sponsor: \n Wanna Bet by Betsy Dudak! \n Harper McReynolds a single mother of two, with a troubled history, who needs stability for herself and her daughters. Randall gives her all she asks for in a boyfriend—kindness, predictability, structure, and routine. Harper's head keeps trying to remind her that she doesn't want the bad boy who makes her combust every time she's near him.\n Brody Reed's addiction claimed a brother's trust and started his own downward spiral. Growing tired of life on the road, a woman at every concert and a dependency on liquid courage, Brody put his life back together piece by broken piece. But the woman he lusts after may just shatter all of this.\n An off-handed bet Brody and Harper make after a passionate kiss may change everything for them. Will they gamble on their hearts to prove to each other they are all in? Or when the stakes get too high, will they fold and walk away?\n Indy Podcast Promo: \n The Secret Life of Weddings\n Spotify, Apple Podcasts, Google Play, Stitcher, etc. or at http://secretlifeofweddings.com/ (http://secretlifeofweddings.com)    Instagram | https://www.instagram.com/secretlifeofweddings/ Twitter | https://twitter.com/secretlifeofwed (https://twitter.com/secretlifeofwed) Facebook Page | https://www.facebook.com/thesecretlifeofweddings Tumblr | https://secretlifeofweddings.tumblr.com YouTube | https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCQJ6EVYHYsmIvs_bnHqKXSg Mentioned in this episode:\nPreorder Naima Simone X Friends Book Boyfriend Box!!\nThis box has EVERYTHING you could ever want in a book boyfriend from Tessa Bailey, Avery Flynn, Farrah Rochon, Jayci Lee, Kennedy Ryan, Adriana Herrera, and Naima Simone.\nYou can look forward to paperbacks, signed book plates, limited edition book boyfriend mugs, the book boyfriend pajamas/loungewear, bookmarks and more!\nTiers include:\n- Cinnamon Roll - $114.99\n- The Alpha - - $169.99 \nEnter the promo code BONKERS10 at checkout to receive $10 off!!! \nONLY AVAILABLE UNTIL OCT 10, 2022!\nIf you have any questions, email orders@honeymagnolia.co.\nhttps://heaving-bosoms.captivate.fm/nsbookboyfriends (Naima's Book Boyfriends)",
