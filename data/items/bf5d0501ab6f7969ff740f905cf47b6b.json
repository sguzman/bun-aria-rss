  "description": "<h2>‘Breakthrough’ In Sudden Infant Death Syndrome Research Is Misleading</h2>\n<p>Last week, headlines made the rounds in online publications and social media that there was a massive breakthrough in research about SIDS: Sudden Infant Death Syndrome. A study out of Australia concluded that babies who died of SIDS had significantly lower levels of an enzyme called BChE. This study was met with cheers by people desperate to understand why SIDS happens.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/sids-research/?utm_source=wnyc&amp;utm_medium=podcast&amp;utm_campaign=scifri\" target=\"_blank\">But many experts say we need to pump the brakes on the celebration.</a> While the study may be promising, it was based on a very limited sample—just 26 babies who had died of SIDS. A variety of factors could explain their different levels of BChE, says Dr. Rachel Moon, a professor of pediatrics and SIDS research at the University of Virginia.</p>\n<p>Moon explains that there are two major hurdles for researchers trying to investigate the causes of SIDS. First, as grieving parents are very unlikely to consent to their deceased child’s use in medical studies, the sample pool for genetic testing of SIDS death is incredibly small. Secondly, there are just very few people who specialize in the syndrome; Dr. Moon suspects there are one hundred or fewer researchers of SIDS in the entire world.
