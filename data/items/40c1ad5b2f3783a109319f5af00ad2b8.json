  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, Dan Bongino fills in for Mark. James Comey’s admission that the dossier wasn’t verified was damaging. The then-FBI Director admitted that it used fake news to spy on a presidential candidate. Hillary Clinton paid a foreign spy to get opposition research on Trump who walked into the FBI with this unverified information from Russian intelligence and the FBI used this phony dossier to get a warrant to spy on the Trump campaign This is the biggest scandal in American history. As FBI Director, Jim Comey only had one job - to verify the information that was presented to him in the fabricated dossier provided by former British spy Christopher Steele, and he failed. Simply put, applications for FISA warrants have to be verified! Then, the liberals contend that we must first prove that the dossier is false, yet under U.S. law our government must verify and make every effort to prove such allegations before bringing charges Later, the media is the main unindicted co-conspirator reporting on the phony dossier as if it were verified and true when it wasn't. Journalism is dead and more people trust the shell game guy in Times Square than they do the media.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
