Get his book.\n\nFrom the image of a lifeless body hanging from a tree to the relentless torture of a rural Tennessee family, all-powerful Kate was the personification of evil. She tortured children, sang hymns, cursed like a sailor, and predicted the future. Kate's missions were to break off Elizabeth Bell's engagement and kill her father, John Bell. She accomplished both. Even today, almost 200 years later, people still report mysterious happenings in the area. After more than two decades of exhaustive research, Bell Witch researcher Pat Fitzhugh for the first time shares everything. This 406-page literary work includes not only the epic tale of terror, but pictures of the area, footnotes that document the author's sources, thought-provoking discussion notes, appendices, an index, and detailed biographical sketches of those who figured into the legend. Pleasant dreams.\n\nFollow us on Instagram @mysteriousradio\nFollow us on TikTok mysteriousradioTikTok\nFollow us on Twitter @mysteriousradio\nFollow us on Pinterest pinterest.com/mysteriousradio\nLike us on Facebook Facebook.com/mysteriousradio\nVisit our website: https://www.mysteriousradio.com\n\nCheck Out Mysterious Radio!
