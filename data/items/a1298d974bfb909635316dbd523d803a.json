  "description": "<p>What do you do for fun? This might seem like a trivial question, but discovering your hobbies can have some pretty large impacts on your financial health and overall well-being. Of course we want to ensure that we’re pursuing frugal hobbies and that we’re being intentional by curating our interests. The mindless pursuit of expensive hobbies is never a good thing- but reaching the end of our working career and finding ourselves bored and restless sounds like a nightmare scenario! We live in a work driven culture, and so we need to cultivate these hobbies and interests now so that we have something to look forward to in retirement other than just ‘not working’. We talk long-term about our money all the time, so this week we’re talking long-term about our hobbies.</p><p>During this episode we each enjoyed a Bourbon Barrel Peach Cider by Tieton Cider Works- a big thanks to Jenna there at the cidery for donating this one to the show!
