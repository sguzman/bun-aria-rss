  "description": "<p>Adam Eget met me at the Comedy Store to talk about Cedu, the crazy bad kid school his parents shipped him off to because he was a spazz. It's amazing what people got away with 20+ years ago. The amount of mistreatment and abuse and murder would never fly now. Sorry for the echoey sound, I didn't realize how hollow that room we recorded in would sound. Listen for the intro and outro for interesting American killers stories.</p>",
