  "description": "<p>Like many, I despair of our country’s division, which is rapidly expanding in lockstep with our inability to productively communicate alongside growing distrust in institutions and the media.</p><p>Also like many, I want solutions. Much of this rests with us. But we also need leadership.</p><p>Across the political landscape, most elected officials understand this problem and its gravity. However, very few proffer solutions beyond the beaten path. Even fewer demonstrate a good-faith willingness to tackle the dilemma with solution-based action.</p><p>Today’s guest&nbsp;<strong>Andrew Yang</strong>&nbsp;is an exception to this pattern.</p><p>For those unfamiliar, Andrew is an entrepreneur turned politician best known for his 2020 presidential run and subsequent New York City mayoral bid. He’s the man who pioneered a national conversation on the power of universal basic income (UBI) to address maladies produced by widening wealth disparity. And he’s a leader I find genuine in his commitment to the greater potential of our democratic experiment, bringing forth original and bold ideas to the national conversation—ideas not always in his best self-interest.</p><p>Part memoir, part campaign trail exposé, Andrew’s latest book,&nbsp;Forward: Notes on the Future of Our Democracy,&nbsp;is an instructive read on the damaged state of politics and political media as well as the broadening national divide that is eroding our humanity. A roadmap on how to repair the broken spokes of our democratic system, it also serves to announce the creation of a new third party—<em>the Forward Party</em>—part of Andrew’s plan to redress democratic dysfunction by disrupting America’s two-party duopoly.</p><p>Today Andrew shares his story and vision.</p><p>This is a relatively partisan-fee conversation about how to reimagine the democratic experiment for the betterment of all.</p><p>We discuss the merits of universal basic income, human-centered capitalism, the problems with our gerontocracy, and what we need to truly progress as a nation.</p><p>In addition, we discuss the perils and merits of a third political party; the role of new media in politics; the advantage of open primaries and rank choice voting; the importance of grace and tolerance; and how to modernize government’s anachronistic bureaucracy.</p><p>To read more <a href=\"https://www.richroll.com/podcast/andrew-yang-640/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">click here</a>.
