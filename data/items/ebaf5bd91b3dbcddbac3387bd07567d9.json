  "description": "“By God, that does looked forked!”\nThis is the story of further American advancements through Northern Mexico and the start of its final invasion from the Gulf Coast. General Stephen Kearney’s descending upon New Mexico. He’ll take the territory without firing a shot, but that doesn’t mean violence isn’t coming. The Taos Revolt will lead to a beheaded American Governor and the execution of New Mexicans by an American regime of questionable legal authority. Meanwhile, Alexander Doniphan’s marching south. He’s going to have some serious throwdowns, like the Battle of Sacramento. It’ll even interrupt his card game.\nAt roughly the same time, Old Zack’s meager army of 5,000 is outnumbered 3 to 1 by Santa Anna at Buena Vista! Can Old Rough and Ready prevail? And finally, we have a new American commander on the scene: Winfield “Old Fuss and Feathers” Scott. He’s landing with a massive army at Mexico’s walled, artillery-laden, castle protected, coastal city of Vera Cruz. So begins the last leg of the Mexican-American War.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
