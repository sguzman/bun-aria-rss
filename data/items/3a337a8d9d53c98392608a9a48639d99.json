  "description": "<p>     Michael and Steve welcome Lou Mustillo (Sal Vitro “The Gardener”) to the Talking Sopranos podcast. Lou was only in four episodes of the Sopranos but he was definitely a memorable character. He looks back at how funny he thought the show was and how much impact it had on his life. He tells a funny story about a day at Yankee stadium when he was shocked to hear the crowd chant “Do My Lawn” in his honor. </p><p>     Then Michael and Steve break down another incredible episode of the Sopranos. As season 6 goes on, the show gets more and more complicated so lots to unpack and discuss. This was a big one for Steve who had a number of important scenes. Check out Talking Sopranos Ep #70 “The Fleshy Part of the Thigh” S6-Ep4.
