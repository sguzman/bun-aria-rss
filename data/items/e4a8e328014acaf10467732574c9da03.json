  "title": "Ask GaryVee Book by Gary Vaynerchuk",
  "description": "Based on the popular video and podcast series, the book gives an insight into one of the world's most talked about entrepreneurs. The show enables listeners to ask Gary questions on anything whether business, entrepreneurship, consumerism or life to understand how they can apply it to their lives. This book has a different format than a usual business book. Based on questions and answers, the reader feels as if the author is directly answering them similar to listening to or watching the show. One caveat will be that the book was written in 2016 so some of the tactics and strategies might have changed since its publication. If you listen to the audiobook, there are updated answers to that in the book, which some may prefer. If you're in business and more specifically brand development, then there is tremendous value in you getting this book. I rate this book four stars.\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
