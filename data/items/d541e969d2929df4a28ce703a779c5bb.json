  "description": "<p>Have you ever noticed that you have certain triggers that don’t seem to go away? Maybe it’s codependency or getting reactive to something your parents say or addiction. These triggers come from traumas, both big T and little t, and only through diving into our own healing journey can we bring them into healing.</p> <p>In this powerful episode, I sit with best-selling author and dear friend Gabby Bernstein as she vulnerably shares how she realized her drug/ alcohol/ work addictions all stemmed from a childhood trauma she experienced that caused her nervous system to cope through hypervigilance.</p> <p>She then shares the most transformative tools she found to heal from these triggers and restore inner peace within her being. We also discuss how often spiritual people may bypass their own emotional healing and how important this part of the journey is. I also share an awakening moment I had through the book about my childhood and relationship with my father, which led to me diving deeper into my own healing journey. This is a deep conversation and one that just may change your life.</p> <p>Get Gabby’s new book Happy Days here.</p> <p>Doors open this Friday for Dharma Coaching Institute!
