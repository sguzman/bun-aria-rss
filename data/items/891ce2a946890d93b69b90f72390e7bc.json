  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, General Colin Powell has passed away. He was National Security Advisor to President Reagan and has always had a respected and mixed political record in Washington. Secretary Powell was an honorable man and loved his country but he did have a mixed record. Then, so-called journalists in the media seem to be preparing to tarnish any potential future Trump candidacy, treating former President Trump as if he's a disease in remission but not quite cured. Criticizing and pressuring their colleagues to not question Biden's inadequacies as president. A biased media is a true threat to the success and future of this republic. Later, Twitter and Facebook are the enemy and they are damaging our country. They believe in promoting lies and banning, then-sitting president of the United States, Donald Trump. Similarly, China is developing new and stronger weapons to further advance their global position. Afterward, the Democrats and Nancy Pelosi's politburo now want to usurp executive privilege to get information from President Trump's then-Chief of Staff Mark Meadows and other White House staffers with the hopes of uncovering embarrassing information to ridicule Trump. Congress' subpoena power has never existed for the political benefit of one's political opposition.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
