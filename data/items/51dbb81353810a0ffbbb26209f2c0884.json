  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, there's still no verdict in the Kyle Rittenhouse trial, but CNN and MSNBC aren't covering the story as much as the other networks. Instead, they've kicked their propaganda into overdrive with former Republicans turned analysts falsely claiming that a white vigilante ran around Kenosha gunning people down. These are not news operations, they're propaganda operations. Then, Chris Christie is getting orders from the Washington Post and the Bush Family, he's no Reagan conservative. The Bush family, specifically Neil Bush, has interesting ties to companies linked to China via a space symposium sponsored by the Bush China Foundation. The left wants a soft military and China sees this. Later, Mark recalls his early days at the Action Agency in the Reagan Administration and discovered boxes of Saul Alinksy's book \"Rules for Radicals\" that were paid for by tax dollars and passed out to the public by the leftists within the government. These radicals remain interspersed in our society today. Afterward, Attorney David Schoen, who defended President Trump in his impeachment calls in to discuss the charges against his current client Steve Bannon. Schoen says that Bannon is being treated very differently from many others charged similarly. What Congress is asking Bannon to do unprecedentedly violates the executive privilege of a President of The United States and is awaiting adjudication on that matter. Subpoenas for privileged information that cannot be produced is unreasonable and deceitful. Finally, Secretary Mayorkas scoffs at Trump's remain-in-Mexico policy and mumbles that he'd prefer to do away with it. Mayorkas added that missed immigration court dates are a misconception.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
