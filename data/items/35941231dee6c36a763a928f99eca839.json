First they’re joined by producer Daniel Schroeder to talk about astrology, enneagrams, and the ways they embrace queer magic. Then they interview artist Leo Herrera about his new series the FATHERS Project, a video series that seeks to answer the question, what if AIDS never existed? Then they get a call from Laura Root of Affirmation where she shares her experience reconciling her Latter Day Saints faith with her life as a gay woman. Then they tackle an advice question about sexual attraction, and as always recommend pieces for the gay agenda. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
