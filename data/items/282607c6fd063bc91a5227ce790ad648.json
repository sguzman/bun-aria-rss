  "description": "<p>Tuesday 2/27- Today on the show we opened up the phone lines to see if our listeners support their family just because they are family or treat them like everyone else, after Bobby Lytes from Love and Hip Hop Miami thinks that Trina should support his music because they are family. Moreover, we also opened up the phone lines to see what classic tv shows they would like to see have a reboot, and Charlamagne made it clear that he does not want a reboot but needs a closure from the tv show \"Girlfriends\". Also, Charlamagne gave \"Donkey of the Day\" to our celebrity and chief Donald Trump, after his comments on school safety, and claiming he would have ran into the school with no gun if he was there during the Florida school shooting. </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
