  "description": "<p>This week, Alice gets to grips with a DIY job and it sparks a discussion about time - in a world where there is never enough of it, how do we come to terms with this most troublesome aspect of life? In different ways, we have both experienced the downside of trying to do too much, including the fact that this prevents us from enjoying the present moment. If art-making is a journey without a final destination (and surely it is), then what are we rushing towards? Why do we feel this pressure to not fall behind? And how can we reframe our thoughts around time? While we don't have all the answers, perhaps our discussion will spark some ideas for you, particularly around how you can be more mindful about time.</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>Find out about the Time to Shine course here: <a href=\"https://www.soulrocketstudio.com/shine\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.soulrocketstudio.com/shine</a></p>\n<p>Louise's interview on Learning to Paint https://www.learntopaintpodcast.com/podcast/episode48</p>\n<p>Even The Rich podcast - Elizabeth Taylor https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/life-loves-elizabeth-taylor-we-will-have-no-more-marriages/id1500477470?i=1000530109907</p>\n<p>Ferne Cotton podcast with Will Young https://podcasts.apple.com/lv/podcast/will-young/id1353058891?i=1000556926241</p>\n<p>Find our websites and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.alicesheridan.com&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicesheridanstudio/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p>Credits: \"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n",
