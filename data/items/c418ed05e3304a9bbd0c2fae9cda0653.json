  "description": "In this episode of Dear Alice, we talk about window treatments. Treating the windows is the finishing touch to a room and it never quite feels put together until done so. Window treatments can be a large investment, considering the size of windows increasing, so we want you to get this right the first time. We talk about the options you have: Drapes, curtains, blinds, and shutters. We talk about what each will feel like, how each react to light, privacy levels, where you need window treatment, and where you could do without. Join us as we discuss what might be the missing thing linking your room together. <br /><br />Introduction 0:15<br />Sheer Drapes 1:50<br />Curtains, Blinds, or Shutters 3:57<br />Blinds 11:17<br />Do’s and Don’ts of Drapery 20:45<br /> <br />“If a panel and a beautiful window treatment is like mascara, I feel the shutter is a really bad false eyelash that’s falling off and just overwhelming the face.” 4:19<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a>",
