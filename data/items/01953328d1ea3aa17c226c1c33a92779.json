  "title": "Paul Krugman may be right",
  "content": "<p>When I was young, Paul Krugman was one of my favorite economists, and I would try to read everything he wrote (which was a lot!). At some point, however, roughly coinciding with his becoming a regular <i>New York Times</i> columnist, he switched from writing as an economist to writing more as a political pundit. I then lost interest. His political commentary struck me as repetitive and slightly unhinged: \"Conservatives are stupid, conservatives are evil, yada, yada, yada.\"</p><p>Yet his column in yesterday's paper caught my eye. It's titled \"<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/09/29/opinion/columnists/federal-reserve-inflation.html\" target=\"_blank\">Is the Fed braking too hard?</a>\" I have been pondering this question myself, and my instincts tell me the answer may be yes. Paul makes the case well.</p><p>Anyway, I am here to recommend the Krugman column, which is something I did not expect myself to be saying.</p><p><i>Update</i>:&nbsp;<span style=\"background-color: white; border: 0px; color: #444444; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><span style=\"font-family: inherit;\"><a href=\"http://econbrowser.com/archives/2022/09/guest-contribution-has-the-fed-pivoted-too-far\" target=\"_blank\"><span style=\"border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\">David Papell</span>&nbsp;and&nbsp;</a><span style=\"border: 0px; margin: 0px; padding: 0px; vertical-align: baseline;\"><a href=\"http://econbrowser.com/archives/2022/09/guest-contribution-has-the-fed-pivoted-too-far\" target=\"_blank\">Ruxandra Prodan</a> reach a similar conclusion about current monetary policy.</span></span></span></p>",
