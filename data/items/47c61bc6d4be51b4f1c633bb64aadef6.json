  "description": "<p>Matt and Zack have been driving (and riding) a lot this week. Matt has the Shelby GT500 AND a Ducati Desert Scrambler. He talk about the Ford's incredible power and poise, and what it's like getting back on a motorcycle. Zack has the 2021 Mini Cooper JCW GP, but they're not sure it's better than the last one. And what are those weird shields for? Plus BMW grills, used car fairness, Corvette vs Ford, and a lot more. </p><p> </p><p>Follow us!</p><p>T: @thesmokingtire @zackklapman</p><p>IG: @thesmokingtire @fakezackklapman</p><p> </p><p>Watch the show!: https://youtu.be/ZXeQSVH5unY</p>\n",
