This is apparently one of the best jidaigeki films ever made. Will your esteemed film scholar hosts agree? Most likely but listen to what we have to say anyway! As always we rundown of the important releases on physical media, featuring the Straight to DVD and Streaming Picks of the Week.&nbsp;&nbsp;Then the show closes with Chris and Matt awarding our Palme d’Esposito awards for the Samurai Marathon.
