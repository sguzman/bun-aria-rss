Starr was a complex and controversial figure: after running the Whitewater and Lewinsky investigations, he went on to serve as president of Baylor University, only to resign over the mishandling of a sex abuse scandal involving the university’s football team, and he would later go on to defend President Trump in Trump’s first impeachment.</p><p>To think through Starr’s legacy, <em>Lawfare</em> senior editor Quinta Jurecic spoke with <em>Lawfare</em> editor-in-chief Benjamin Wittes, who published a <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Starr-Reassessment-Benjamin-Wittes/dp/0300092520\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">book</a> on Starr, and <em>Lawfare</em> contributing editor Paul Rosenzweig, who worked with Starr on the Clinton investigation. They took a look back on the Starr investigation and how the probe shaped the culture and practice of presidential investigations in ways that are more relevant than ever in the Trump era.</p><p>Support this show <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"http://supporter.acast.com/lawfare\">http://supporter.acast.com/lawfare</a>.</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
