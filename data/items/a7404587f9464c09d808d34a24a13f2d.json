  "description": "In today's podcast, we hear about how Fancy Bear left tracks in Bitly, and Fancy Bear did an awful lot of phishing going back to March 2015.

The University of Maryland's Jonathan Katz explains the recent Z-Coin crypto-currency bug. Bob Ackerman from Allegis Captical and DataTribe offers insights on the investment environment for cyber. And no, that's not a famous theologian tweeting: it's the head G-Man.",
