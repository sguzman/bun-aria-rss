  "description": "Adam and Dr. Drew open the show discussing cannabis addiction and how it is largely written off by many in the media. They also discuss Adam's interview with Scott Baio who used to be able to work as a republican in Hollywood and how he's seen that change. We then touch briefly on The Love Boat and pay off the Jimmy Carter clip we were looking for in our last show. They also review an article written by an Isreali immunologist who is highly critical of the Covid response. As the show wraps up the guys go back in time and review some of their tweets from earlier in the pandemic to see how they've aged. \n\nPlease Support Our Sponsors:\nTommyJohn.com/ADS\nGeico.com",
