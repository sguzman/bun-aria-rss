Lets look at the structural characteristics one by one. We will delve into the numbers/tables later.</p>\n<h4>Directed Acyclic Graph (DAG)</h4>\n<p>We obviously have one node per random variable.</p>\n<p><strong>Directed</strong>: The connections/edges denote cause->effect relationships between pairs of nodes. For example <em>Burglary</em>-><em>Alarm</em> in the above network indicates that the occurrence of a burglary directly affects the probability of the Alarm going off (and <em>not</em> the other way round). Here, <em>Burglary</em> is the parent, while <em>Alarm</em> is the child node.</p>\n<p><strong>Acyclic</strong>: There cannot be a cycle in a BBN. In simple English, a variable <img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" srcset=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=A&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x\" alt=\"A\" class=\"latex\" /> cannot depend on its own value &#8211; directly, or indirectly. If this was allowed, it would lead to a sort of infinite recursion which we are not prepared to deal with. However, if you do realize that an event happening affects its probability later on, then you could express the two occurrences as separate nodes in the BBN (or use a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dynamic_Bayesian_network\">Dynamic BBN</a>).</p>\n<h4>Parents of a Node</h4>\n<p>One of the biggest considerations while building a BBN is to decide which parents to assign to a particular node. Intuitively, they should be those variables which most directly affect the value of the current node.</p>\n<p>Formally, this can be stated as follows: &#8220;The parents of a variable <img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" srcset=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x\" alt=\"X\" class=\"latex\" /> (<img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=parents%28X%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" srcset=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=parents%28X%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=parents%28X%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x\" alt=\"parents(X)\" class=\"latex\" />) are the <strong>minimal</strong> set of ancestors of <img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" srcset=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x\" alt=\"X\" class=\"latex\" />, such that all other ancestors of <img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" srcset=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x\" alt=\"X\" class=\"latex\" /> are <strong>conditionally independent</strong> of <img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" srcset=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x\" alt=\"X\" class=\"latex\" /> given <img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=parents%28X%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" srcset=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=parents%28X%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=parents%28X%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x\" alt=\"parents(X)\" class=\"latex\" />&#8220;.</p>\n<p>Lets take this step by step. First off, there has to be some sort of a cause-effect relationship between <img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" srcset=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x\" alt=\"Y\" class=\"latex\" /> and <img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" srcset=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x\" alt=\"X\" class=\"latex\" /> for <img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" srcset=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x\" alt=\"Y\" class=\"latex\" /> to be one of the ancestors of <img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" srcset=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x\" alt=\"X\" class=\"latex\" />. In the shown example, the ancestors of <em>Mary Calls</em> are <em>Burglary</em>, <em>Earthquake</em> and <em>Alarm</em>.</p>\n<p>Now consider the two ancestors <em>Alarm</em> and <em>Earthquake</em>. The only way an <em>Earthquake</em> would affect <em>Mary Calls</em>, is if an <em>Earthquake</em> causes <em>Alarm</em> to go off, leading to <em>Mary Calls</em>. Suppose someone told you that <em>Alarm</em> has in fact gone off. In this case, it does not matter what lead to the <em>Alarm</em> ringing &#8211; since Mary will react to it based on the stimulus of the <em>Alarm</em> itself. In other words, <em>Earthquake</em> and <em>Mary Calls</em> become <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_independence\">conditionally independent</a> if you know the exact value of <em>Alarm</em>.</p>\n<p>Mathematically speaking, <img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28Mary+Calls%7CAlarm%2CEarthquake%29+%3D%3D+P%28Mary+Calls%7CAlarm%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" srcset=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28Mary+Calls%7CAlarm%2CEarthquake%29+%3D%3D+P%28Mary+Calls%7CAlarm%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=P%28Mary+Calls%7CAlarm%2CEarthquake%29+%3D%3D+P%28Mary+Calls%7CAlarm%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x\" alt=\"P(Mary Calls|Alarm,Earthquake) == P(Mary Calls|Alarm)\" class=\"latex\" />.</p>\n<p>Thus, <img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=parents%28X%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" srcset=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=parents%28X%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=parents%28X%29&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x\" alt=\"parents(X)\" class=\"latex\" /> are those ancestors which do not become conditionally independent of <img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" srcset=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x\" alt=\"X\" class=\"latex\" /> given the value of some other ancestor. If they do, then the resultant connection would actually be redundant.</p>\n<h4>Disconnected Nodes are Conditionally Independent</h4>\n<p>Based on the directed connections in a BBN, if there is no way to go from a variable <img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" srcset=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x\" alt=\"X\" class=\"latex\" /> to <img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" srcset=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x\" alt=\"Y\" class=\"latex\" /> (or vice versa), then <img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" srcset=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=X&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x\" alt=\"X\" class=\"latex\" /> and <img src=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002\" srcset=\"https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002 1x, https://s0.wp.com/latex.php?latex=Y&#038;bg=ffffff&#038;fg=555555&#038;s=0&#038;c=20201002&#038;zoom=4.5 4x\" alt=\"Y\" class=\"latex\" /> are conditionally independent. In the example BBN, pairs of variables that are conditionally independent are {<em>Mary Calls, John Calls</em>} and {<em>Burglary, Earthquake</em>}.</p>\n<p>It is important to remember that &#8216;conditionally independent&#8217; does not mean &#8216;totally independent&#8217;. Consider {<em>Mary Calls, John Calls</em>}. Given the value of <em>Alarm</em> (that is, whether the <em>Alarm</em> went off or not), Mary and John each have their own independent probabilities of calling. However, if you did not know about any of the other nodes, but just that John did call, then your expectation of Mary calling would correspondingly increase.</p>\n<h3>Mathematics behind Bayesian Networks</h3>\n<p>BBNs provide a mathematically correct way of assessing the effects of different events (or nodes, in this context) on each other. And these assessments can be made in <em>either direction</em> &#8211; not only can you compute the most likely effects given the values of certain causes, but also determine the most likely causes of observed events.</p>\n<p>The numerical data provided with the BBN (by an expert or some statistical study) that allows us to do this is:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>The prior probabilities of variables with no parents (<em>Earthquake</em> and <em>Burglary</em> in our example).</li>\n<li>The conditional probabilities of any other node given every value-combination of its parent(s). For example, the table next to <em>Alarm</em> defines the probability that the <em>Alarm</em> will go off given the whether an <em>Earthquake</em> and/or <em>Burglary</em> have occurred.</li>\n</ol>\n<p>In case of continuous variables, we would need a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conditional_probability_distribution\">conditional probability distribution</a>.</p>\n<p>The biggest use of Bayesian Networks is in computing <a href=\"http://www.investopedia.com/terms/p/posterior-probability.asp\"><em><strong>revised probabilities</strong></em></a>. A revised probability defines the probability of a node given the values of one or more other nodes as a fact. Lets take an example from the <em>Burglary-Alarm</em> BBN.</p>\n<p>Suppose we want to calculate the probability that an earthquake occurred, given that the alarm went off, but there was no burglary.

cause of it. This should make sense intuitively as well. Which brings us to the final part &#8211;</p>\n<h3>The &#8216;Explain Away&#8217; Effect</h3>\n<p>The <em>Explain Away</em> effect, commonly associated with BBNs, is a result of computing revised probabilities. It refers to the phenomenon where knowing that one cause has occurred, reduces (but does not eliminate) the probability that the other cause(s) took place.</p>\n<p>Suppose instead of knowing that there has been no burglary like in our example, you infact did know that one has taken place. It also led to the Alarm going off. With this information in mind, your tendency to check out the &#8216;earthquake&#8217; hypothesis reduces drastically. In other words, the burglary has <em>explained away</em> the alarm.</p>\n<p>It is important to note that the probability for other causes just gets reduced, but does NOT go down to zero. In a stroke of bad luck, it could have happened that both a burglary and an earthquake happened, and any one of the two stimuli could have led to the alarm ringing. To what extent you can &#8216;explain away&#8217; an evidence depends on the conditional probability distributions.</p>\n",
