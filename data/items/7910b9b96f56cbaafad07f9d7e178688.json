  "description": "<p>     This week on Talking Sopranos Michael Imperioli and Steve Schirripa finish off season five with special guest Toni Kalem (Angie Bonpensiero). </p><p>     During the interview Michael and Steve are really surprised to find out that Toni was a finalist to play the role of Carmela! She was the one who went to LA for the screen test with Jim and the folks from HBO. Toni also talks about her early days as an actress in NYC. How she had to deal with the old casting couch mentality and how her bosses literally chased her around the desk. Luckily she was able to make the right connections and it was her talent that rose above. David Chase saw Toni in a film called The Wanderers and asked her to audition for the Sopranos. She didn’t get the role of Carmela but did land the part of Angie Bonpensiero, and wrote one episode herself. In the early days HBO wouldn’t fly her from LA so she lived with her parents while acting in one of the biggest TV shows in history. </p><p>     Then Michael and Steve get another letter from A S. This time he really rips into Michael, and Steve has had it!. This may be the end of AS…After that Michael and Steve finish off season 5. This is another incredible episode and one that David Chase originally thought could be the series finale. Don’t miss Talking Sopranos #66 S5-Ep13 “All Due Respect”.
