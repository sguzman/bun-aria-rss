  "description": "Walmart has caved to the left and will stop selling ammunition for semi-automatic firearms. It is also asking customers not to open carry in their stores. Both of these measures are absurd and pointless. I'll explain why. Also, a woman brings an emotional support horse on a flight and Calvin Klein competes with Gillette for the most insufferably stupid ad campaign. Finally I respond to the very colorful emails from our Harry Potter discussion yesterday. Date: 09-04-2019\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
