  "description": "<p><strong>Your best friend speaks glowingly about her fianc&eacute;, but she lives far away and your recent communications have only taken place by text and telephone. The thing is, this fianc&eacute; seems to be ever-present and listening in the background whenever she's in contact</strong>, and she let it slip that he's fantasized about seeing her lick from a dog's dish. You're worried he might be controlling every aspect of her life, but she doesn't seem to be distressed. Could what you perceive to be tyrannical oversight just be part of a consensual power dynamic they've established in their relationship?
