  "description": "Happy Thanksgiving, American HBs! We're so thankful to and for you, listener, no matter where you're from. What better way to show that than with a themed episode?! We bring you THANKSGIVING by Janet Evanovich! It's a book we expected to love because we love Stephanie Plum so much, but were mostly confused, amused, and amazed by. Join us on this journey where two eccentric narcissists non sequitur each other into love. Maybe? We think? Thanksgiving is involved! \n *if you'd like to advertise on Heaving Bosoms email heavingbosomspodcast@gmail.com it's a pretty cheap!*\n Bonus Content: \n Hansel and Gretel jokes, Erin's drunken excursions into Colonial Williamsburg, old-timey dick joke hilarity, *Bing Boong Bong* Mandatory Reporters with Erin, nose obsessions, INSANE reading by Melody, and so much more! \n Lady Loves: \n Melody: Listen to Wicked Wallflowers Club's episode with Angelina M. Lopez  HERE! It's so empowering regarding how podcasting is one more way to celebrate romance and connect with other romance lovers. Angelina also opens up about her 20 year journey to becoming a romance author and it's an inspiring take on setting boundaries, embracing your limits, flexing your writing muscles in other, small ways, and then really committing when the time and idea are right. And I'm so thankful for our sister podcasts WWC, Fated Mates, and Black Chick Lit. We have been embraced by some truly brilliant and wonderful women and you should listen to them all!  \n Erin: ...have you heard of  snack olives? They make these little packages of olives that are a tiny tasty treat. \n PATREON SHOUT OUT:\n Kimberly L, you are descended from Priapus, a rustic god of abundance, guardian domesticated animals, a protector bees and gardens, and a fixture in humorous tales. You are a wonderfully sweet soul who connects easily with animals and you serve as a refuge to many, animal and human alike. You project a safe, protective vibe without trying, and yet, you manage to also be boisterous and fuckin' hilarious. Finally, and I’m not sure if anyone has told you this before, but you give off some serious BDE. That’s Big Dick Energy for the uninitiated. You can than Priapus for that, too, because he had a famously large penis. So. Get on with your bad self, Kimberly. And never change. \n Make sure to check out our Patreon bonus content!\n Subscribe!
