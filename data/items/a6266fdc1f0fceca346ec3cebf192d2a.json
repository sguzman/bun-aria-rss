  "description": "Cuffing Season is back! In this series, God has been revealing that we are all cuffed to something in life. The question is are you going to stay cuffed, or find freedom in Jesus? This week, we learn all about the dangers of cocky Christianity. God has promises for us. But we often can’t step into those promises because we won’t give up control. Pastor Mike teaches us that we are never fully in control, and we can only find true peace when we give it up for God’s plan. We can never be cuffed and in control. If you’re wondering how to give God more control in your life, this message is for you!<br /><br />#CuffingSeason #CuffedToControl #control",
