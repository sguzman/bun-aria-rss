  "description": "On today’s show, the guys chat about some current TV shows and movies that they’ve enjoyed or can’t stand, discuss some of the strategies about the weight loss challenge as the first weigh in date gets closer, and chat about everything and anything that comes up in a very free flowing conversation. Todd also wants to know what brand or product the guys would choose if they could be the spokesperson for only one, they play some fact or fiction, and answer some listener questions including what they would do if they could take all the hours from one activity throughout their lives and dedicate it to learning something else, and choose some football coaches for one another. To close out the show, the guys all give some more of their vitamin thoughts. It’s a fun one, come and have a good time with us.\n\nThis episode features @toddmccomas, @PatMcAfeeShow, @Digz, @nickmaraldo, @tyschmit, @BostonConnr, @HeyGorman, @VivalaZito, and @baileymccomas, and ends with Ryan Gosling’s piano solo from La La Land\n",
