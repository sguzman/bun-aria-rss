  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat, AJ, and the boys chat about all the things coming out from the NFL Owner meetings being held in New York, Allen Lazard being out for Thursday Night Football as a Covid19 close contact and if it's possible we see any other players show up on the Covid19 list, and everything else going on around the league as we approach Week 8. Joining the program for his weekly appearance from the NFL Owners Meetings is NFL Network Insider, Ian Rapoport. Pat and Ian chat about everything being discussed at the Owners Meetings, Roger Goodell appearing a little flustered when being questioned about the Washington Football Team email leaks and accusations, Mark Davis' comments about everything going on with his football team, what he's hearing injury and Covid wise for Thursday Night's game between the Packers and Cardinals, and everything else going on around the league (24:33-42:14). Later, Coach Chuck Pagano joins the show for his weekly Coach Us Up Chuck segment to chat about how much an Owner would communicate with a Head Coach during a week like this, Coach Tomlin's presser and thoughts on the USC job, Joe Barry being out due to Covid Thursday and how that will impact the game, Robert Saleh and the Jets and how they turn that thing around, and his thoughts on the whole situation going on down in Miami with the Dolphins (42:16-1:11:33). Later, friend of the program, MLB Insider for ESPN, The Jett, Jeff Passan, joins the show to chat about the World Series, defend baseball a little bit, a potential work stoppage in the offseason, and he prepares for battle with an old adversary (1:37:28-2:01:04).
