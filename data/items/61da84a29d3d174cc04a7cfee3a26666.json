  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, President Trump was cool, clear, and concise in his coronavirus press briefing. Despite the topic being the federal government's response, the reporters only asked about his mask-wearing habits and how often he gets tested. Trump subjects himself to the hostile Democrat Party media, yet candidate Joe Biden never presents himself to anyone in the conservative media. Then, the media keeps driving the false narrative that any federal action to protect federal buildings and courts is a tyrannical move to steal the November election. Also suggesting that Trump will reject the outcome of the election to paint him as a dictator. It's sick! Later, Steve Schmidt is one of the four Washington stooges that trash President Trump and the American people through the questionable Lincoln Project. Their entire goal is to assassinate the character of the President of the United States. Meanwhile, the media asks Trump if he's responsible for the virus, but no one asks Anthony Fauci if he's responsible for giving floundering information. Will anyone in the media ask Fauci or Barack Obama if they were responsible for the deaths from the H1N1 pandemic? Afterward, economist John Lott calls in to discuss his new book, Gun Control Myths: How politicians, the media, and botched \"studies\" have twisted the facts on gun control.\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Gun-Control-Myths-politicians-botched/dp/B08C95PD1K/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=\nLearn more about your ad choices.
