  "title": "Top 6 QB Debates! Can Watson Have His Best Season Yet? (06/22 Fantasy Football Podcast)",
  "description": "It's a big rankings week here on Fantasy Football Today as we look at the Top 5 at each position. With QB, you really have to discuss the Top 6. Let's take a look at early ADP (2:33) and see how far ahead of the pack Patrick Mahomes and Lamar Jackson are before we take a quick detour with some news and notes (8:00). Can Curtis Samuel be a sleeper this season? ... Jackson or Mahomes (12:00)? Let's pick these guys apart and figure out what separates one from the other. Then we'll move on to the next four (23:50). How do we rank Russell Wilson, Kyler Murray, Dak Prescott and Deshaun Watson? Why does Jamey have Watson as his QB3 even without DeAndre Hopkins? Why does Heath have Prescott in a tier ahead of the other three? Does Dave believe Murray has QB1 upside? ... We finish with some Fill in the Blank (41:30) to sum up our thoughts and to figure out which one of these six QBs we'd like to have lunch with. And what would we eat!? ...
