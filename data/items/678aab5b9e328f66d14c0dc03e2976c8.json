  "description": "<p>Plant-based food might have started out as a niche lifestyle choice for vegans and vegetarians back in the 1970s (hello, Tofurky!), but today you can find plant-based milk, cheese, fish, meat — and so much more — in the aisles of your local grocery store. The plant-based market is even conquering fast food, appearing nationwide on menus at major chains like McDonald's, Burger King, Kentucky Fried Chicken, and White Castle. On this episode of Next Question with Katie Couric, Katie talks with one of the innovators behind the plant-based revolution — Ethan Brown, the CEO of Beyond Meat.
