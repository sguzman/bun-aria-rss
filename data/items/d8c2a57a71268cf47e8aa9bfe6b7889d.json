  "description": "We're accustomed to lots of deadlines in the NFL, but this isn't one we ever expected to be talking about. The deadline for players to opt out of the 2020 season over COVID-19 concerns passed on Thursday with a few names added to the list, bringing the total to 66. Tre'Davious White was not one of those names, but he was still forced to defend himself on Twitter. There was zero reason for White to receive criticism though. The Pick Six Superfriends break down which teams were hurt the most by opt outs before addressing the same thing happening in college football. Will Brinson, Ryan Wilson and John Breech react to projected Top 10 picks Gregory Rousseau from Miami and Micah Parsons from Penn State deciding to skip the season and focus on the 2021 NFL Draft, with coronavirus looming over the sport. Oh yeah, did Derek Carr get caught with a burner account? \n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
