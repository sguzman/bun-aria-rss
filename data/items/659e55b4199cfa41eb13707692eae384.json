  "description": "<p>It's fair to say that July 2014 will not go down as the most active month in video game history.\nThere were so few major releases this July that we decided the best way to cope was to go into the deep, dark past. Each Bestie was asked to select one game from their childhood that they love. The rule, though, was that at least two of the remaining three Besties had to have not played that game, so some of us would be playing them with fresh eyes. It was an enlightening experience.\nDespite coming up with a whole backup plan for the lack of July games, it actually did end up as a pretty solid month, so we spend the top half of the show on some of the new releases, if that's your bag.\n(Oh, and Justin couldn't make this episode because babies. Don't worry, he'll be back next month!)\n<p>5:00 - Some actually good games from July 2014!<br />\n31:00 - Actraiser (Frushtick)<br />\n43:30 - Quest for Glory (Griffin)<br />\n58:00 - Half Time<br />\n1:03:00 - News<br />\n1:16:00 - River City Ransom (Plante)<br />\n1:24:30 - The Beast Within: A Gabriel Knight Mystery (Justin)<br />\n1:43:00 - Resties!</p>\n<p>Theme song by Ian Dorsch<br />\nGet the show:</p>\n<p>Download MP3\"<br />\nSubscribe to the podcast (RSS)<br />\nSubscribe on iTunes</p></p>\n",
