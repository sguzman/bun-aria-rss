Bert tries to talk less and ask Tom more questions about what he values. We get into how big of an impact Chris Rock has had on him. We then get a little too much insight on Bert's experience in the bathroom. Bert then wants to find out what luxury means to Tom as they discuss, whiskey, cigars, watches and more! Tom then gets into what it was like to get the car he's been fantasizing about for more than 15 years. Tom shares a devastating meme of Bert and almost dies laughing. The bears then try to imagine their wives with hot throat tattoos and discuss possible matching tattoos for themselves.</p>\n",
