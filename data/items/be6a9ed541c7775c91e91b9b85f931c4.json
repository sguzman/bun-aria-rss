  "description": "<p>EPISODE 59 - JON KILIK - Producer</p> <p>We had the opportunity of sitting down with a producer we’ve had the pleasure of working with, Jon Kilik (FOXCATCHER, THE HUNGER GAMES, BABEL, DO THE RIGHT THING). He clued us in on a few subjects - whey there are so many producers on projects, how the producer credit has been devalued, and the difference in the producer roles in movies and TV. We learned that there’s always a way to figure out how to get a movie made and how he chooses projects. He also shared his experiences of working with Spike Lee with whom he has been a frequent collaborator. And that’s just a few of the subjects we got into! A great episode you won’t want to miss!</p>",
