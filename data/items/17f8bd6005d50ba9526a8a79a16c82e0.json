We’re talking about how to take care of your vulva, the importance of strengthening your pelvic floor, WTF is up with menopause, and so much more. My first guest is OB/GYN, author of the She-Ology book series, and an expert in all things women’s sexual health, Dr. Sherry Ross. She shares the benefits of getting to know your (or your partner’s) vulva, the relationship between insecurity and porn, solutions for painful sex, and of course, squirting.</p><p>Next, we have MaryEllen Reider, from Yarlap, who joins me to talk about the importance of the pelvic floor muscles. Did you know that stronger pelvic floor muscles can make stronger orgasms? It’s true! Finally, the founder of Tabu, Natalie Waltz, and her mother, Ouhoud Dabbas help me demystify menopause and discuss how masturbation can help increase your libido.</p><br><p><em>For more information about Dr. Sherry, visit: </em><a href=\"https://www.drsherry.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>drsherry.com</em></a></p><p><em>For more information about MaryEllen Reider & Yarlap, visit: </em><a href=\"https://yarlap.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>yarlap.com</em></a></p><p><em>For more information about Natalie Waltz & Ouhoud Dabbas, visit:&nbsp;</em><a href=\"https://www.heytabu.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>heytabu.com</em></a></p><p>For even more sex advice, tips, and tricks visit <a href=\"http://sexwithemily.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">sexwithemily.com</a></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
