  "description": "<p>In this short note we discuss high-dimensional examples of Legendrian\nsubmanifolds of the standard contact Euclidean space with an infinite number of\nexact Lagrangian fillings up to Hamiltonian isotopy. They are obtained from the\nexamples of Casals and Ng by applying to them the spherical spinning\nconstruction.\n</p>",
