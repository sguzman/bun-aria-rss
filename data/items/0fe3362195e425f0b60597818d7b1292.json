  "description": "<p>This year we’re organizing the <a href=\"http://approximateinference.org\">third NIPS workshop on approximate inference</a>. It is together with Francisco Ruiz, Stephan Mandt, Cheng Zhang, and James Mclnerney—and alongside our amazing committee of Tamara Broderick, Michalis Titsias, David Blei, and Max Welling.</p>\n\n<p>Call for papers below.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Note</strong>: We have a <em>lot</em> of funding for awards this year.  We’ve\ndecided to not only allocate some funding for Ph.D. students and early\npostdocs, but we also feature a best paper award. Submit your papers!</p>\n\n<div class=\"highlighter-rouge\"><div class=\"highlight\"><pre class=\"highlight\"><code>Call For Papers\nNIPS Workshop on Advances in Approximate Bayesian Inference\nFriday, 8th December 2017, Long Beach, California\nURL: http://approximateinference.org\n\nSubmission deadline: Nov 01, 2017\nPlease direct questions to: aabiworkshop2017@gmail.com\n\n## Call for Participation\n\nWe invite researchers to submit their recent work on the development, analysis, or application of approximate Bayesian inference.\n\nA submission should take the form of an extended abstract of 2-4 pages in PDF format using the NIPS style. Author names do not need to be anonymized and references may extend as far as needed beyond the 4 page upper limit. If authors' research has previously appeared in a journal, workshop, or conference (including NIPS 2017), their workshop submission should extend that previous work. Submissions may include a supplement/appendix, but reviewers are not responsible for reading any supplementary material.\n\nThis year, the workshop offers multiple best paper awards. They are open to all researchers, and a few awards are restricted to junior researchers. Submitting by the deadline automatically entitles you for consideration for all of the following:\n\n+ Roughly $3000 in total, to be allocated across winners\n+ Four NIPS 2017 workshop registration fee waivers\n\n## Abstract\n\nApproximate inference is key to modern probabilistic modeling. Thanks to the availability of big data, significant computational power, and sophisticated models, machine learning has achieved many breakthroughs in multiple application domains. At the same time, approximate inference becomes critical since exact inference is intractable for most models of interest. Within the field of approximate Bayesian inference, variational and Monte Carlo methods are currently the mainstay techniques. For both methods, there has been considerable progress both on the efficiency and performance.\n\nIn this workshop, we encourage submissions advancing approximate inference methods. We are open to a broad scope of methods within the field of Bayesian inference. In addition, we also encourage applications of approximate inference in many domains, such as computational biology, recommender systems, differential privacy, and industry applications.\n\n## Key Dates\n\nNov 01, 2017: Submission Deadline\nNov 15, 2017: Notification of Acceptance\nNov 24, 2017: Submission Reviews &amp; Award Notifications\n\n## Organizers\n\nFrancisco Ruiz, Stephan Mandt, Cheng Zhang, James Mclnerney, Dustin Tran\n\n## Advisory Committee\n\nTamara Broderick, Michalis Titsias, David Blei, Max Welling\n</code></pre></div></div>",
