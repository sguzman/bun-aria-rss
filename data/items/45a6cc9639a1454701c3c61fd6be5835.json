  "description": "Shark Tank star and billionaire investor Kevin O’Leary is predicting that Bitcoin, (the king crypto) will surge in value once regulatory clarity is in place.\n\n“At some point in the next two to three years, the US regulator is going to rule on cryptocurrencies. And they will rule first on stablecoins and Bitcoin itself… And the very large assets by market cap.\n\nAs soon as that happens, if I’m running a sovereign fund or a pension plan I’m going to allocate to it probably one to three percent. And I want to long Bitcoin when that happens.\n\nYou want to talk about Bitcoin going to $100,000, $200,000 $300,000, it’s going to be when institutions can finally buy it.”\nLearn more about your ad choices.
