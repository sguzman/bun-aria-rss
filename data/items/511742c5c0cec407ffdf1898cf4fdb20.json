  "title": "Joseph Mileti, \"Modern Mathematical Logic\" (Cambridge UP, 2022)",
  "description": "Today I had the pleasure of talking to Joe Mileti, associate professor of mathematics at Grinnell College. Even if you are not \"into\" math, you will enjoy this conversation. We talked about how math is not what you think it is. It's not just memorizing formulas and grinding. It's about thinking and, like all thinking, it involves abstraction, logic, using analogies and metaphors, and a bunch of imagination. We also talked about how math is about talking to other mathematicians and doing a kind of \"brainstorming.\" \nJoes's new book is Modern Mathematical Logic (Cambridge UP, 2022).\nMarshall Poe is the founder and editor of the New Books Network.
