  "description": "<p>In 1980, as Mt. St. Helens threatened to erupt, local officials evacuated the area. They had one problem: Local lodge owner Harry R. Truman refused to go. He said the mountain and the lake his lodge sat on were like his arms and legs, and if he left, he would die. But that’s what would happen if he stayed. We explore the behavioral science behind why some people refuse to leave home in the face of natural disasters, through the complicated story of Harry R. Truman.</p><p>Truman’s story is told by his niece, 93-year-old Shirley Rosen, who used to work at his lodge during the summer, and who stood by in Seattle hoping her uncle would come to his senses. <a href=\"https://www.udel.edu/faculty-staff/experts/jennifer-horney/\" target=\"_blank\">Jennifer Horney</a> from the Disaster Research Center at the University of Delaware explains why people want to stay at home even though they might be in danger. <a href=\"https://www.washington.edu/news/people/thomas-hinckley/\" target=\"_blank\">Thomas Hinckley,</a> a former environmental sciences professor at the University of Washington, gives us the lay of the land surrounding Mt.
