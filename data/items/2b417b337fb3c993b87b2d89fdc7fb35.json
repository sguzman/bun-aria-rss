As one of the premier interior and architecture photographers of his generation, he’s worked with everyone from Steven Gambrel to Bridget Romanek to Ken Fulk—to say nothing of the portraits he’s shot, ranging from Hilary Rodham Clinton to Faye Dunaway. On this episode of the podcast, Douglas chats with host Dennis Scully about the challenges of photography in a digital age, how the shifting economics of magazine publishing can create opportunities for designers, and why a great photograph can sometimes come down to moving a single flower in a vase.</p><p>This episode is sponsored by<strong> </strong><a href=\"www.junipermarket.com\"><strong>Juniper Market</strong></a></p><p><i><strong>LINKS</strong></i><br /><a href=\"www.instagram.com/douglasfriedman\"><strong>Douglas Friedman</strong></a><br /><a href=\"www.instagram.com/dennisscully\"><strong>Dennis Scully</strong></a><br /><a href=\"www.businessofhome.com\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Business of Home</strong></a></p><p> </p><p> </p>\n",
