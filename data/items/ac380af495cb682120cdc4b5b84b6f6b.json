  "description": "The Syria strike was likely highly ineffective due to the fact that it was limited in impact, came without a long-term strategy or much likelihood of follow-up actions to end the use of chemical weapons or the wholesale slaughter of Syrians.  But wait, it gets worse: It was also an illegal strike by almost every measure.  But hey, that's not a bug it's a feature of the Trump approach to the presidency and life.  He's one of those people who sees the law as something only little people must deal with.  We discuss what that means for him, U.S. foreign policy, and this teetering presidency with Oona Hathaway of Yale Law School, Susan Hennessey of Lawfare, Kim Ghattas of the Carnegie Endowment and our own Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law School.Tune in!Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
