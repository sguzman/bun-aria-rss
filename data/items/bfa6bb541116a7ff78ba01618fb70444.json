  "description": "On Monday’s Mark Levin’s Show, Democrats in Congress want to give your tax dollars to foreign students and non-citizens under the CARES Act. However, Education Secretary Betsy DeVos is pushing back to make sure the law is followed as written and to ensure that U.S Colleges with huge endowments don't get their hands on tax-payer dollars. Members of Congress that are promoting the idea that the U.S Treasury should use taxpayer dollars to fund the National Education Association must be stopped. Then, New York Governor Andrew Cuomo isn’t backtracking on his deadly decision to force nursing homes to take patients recovering from the Coronavirus. He has now doubled-down, denying patients in one cobble hill home the chance to go the U.S Navy ship Comfort for additional care. Later, the leftists in the media continue to craft a narrative that President Trump is responsible for the deaths of those that fell ill from the coronavirus and not the failures of governors across America. Afterward, Joe Biden is credibly accused by a woman of molestation and the media and Democrats are silent. Finally, Dr. Dan Erickson explains that you have a 0.03% chance of dying from COVID-19 in the State of California and why that doesn't necessitate sheltering in place.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
