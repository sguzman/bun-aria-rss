During Creator Week 2022, we’re inviting creators around the world to join us in growing their careers, connecting with peers and building a future together. We’re also announcing new ways creators can earn money on Facebook and Instagram.</span></p>\n<h2>Updates to Digital Collectibles</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Creators will soon be able to make their own </span><a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/05/introducing-digital-collectibles-to-showcase-nfts-instagram/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">digital collectibles</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> on Instagram and sell them to fans, both on and off Instagram. They’ll have an end-to-end toolkit — from creation</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> (starting on the Polygon blockchain) </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">and showcasing, to selling. People can easily support their favorite creators by buying their digital collectibles directly within Instagram. We’re testing these new features with a small group of creators in the US first, and hope to expand to more countries soon.</span></p>\n<p><img class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-36703\" src=\"https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/01_DIGITAL-COLLECTIBLES.png?resize=890%2C775\" alt=\"Product mocks of selling digital collectibles on Instagram\" width=\"890\" height=\"775\" srcset=\"https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/01_DIGITAL-COLLECTIBLES.png?resize=890%2C775?w=1920 1920w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/01_DIGITAL-COLLECTIBLES.png?resize=890%2C775?w=300 300w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/01_DIGITAL-COLLECTIBLES.png?resize=890%2C775?w=768 768w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/01_DIGITAL-COLLECTIBLES.png?resize=890%2C775?w=1024 1024w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/01_DIGITAL-COLLECTIBLES.png?resize=890%2C775?w=1536 1536w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/01_DIGITAL-COLLECTIBLES.png?resize=890%2C775?w=1240 1240w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/01_DIGITAL-COLLECTIBLES.png?resize=890%2C775?w=689 689w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/01_DIGITAL-COLLECTIBLES.png?resize=890%2C775?w=1780 1780w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 890px) 100vw, 890px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-36704\" src=\"https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/02_DIGITAL-COLLECTIBLES.png?resize=890%2C775\" alt=\"Product mocks of selling digital collectibles on Instagram\" width=\"890\" height=\"775\" srcset=\"https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/02_DIGITAL-COLLECTIBLES.png?resize=890%2C775?w=1920 1920w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/02_DIGITAL-COLLECTIBLES.png?resize=890%2C775?w=300 300w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/02_DIGITAL-COLLECTIBLES.png?resize=890%2C775?w=768 768w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/02_DIGITAL-COLLECTIBLES.png?resize=890%2C775?w=1024 1024w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/02_DIGITAL-COLLECTIBLES.png?resize=890%2C775?w=1536 1536w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/02_DIGITAL-COLLECTIBLES.png?resize=890%2C775?w=1240 1240w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/02_DIGITAL-COLLECTIBLES.png?resize=890%2C775?w=689 689w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/02_DIGITAL-COLLECTIBLES.png?resize=890%2C775?w=1780 1780w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 890px) 100vw, 890px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We’re also expanding the types of digital collectibles that you can showcase on Instagram to include video and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">adding support for the Solana blockchain and Phantom wallet, in addition to the </span><a href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/05/introducing-digital-collectibles-to-showcase-nfts-instagram/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">blockchains and wallets</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> that we already support. Lastly, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">information for select collections where the metadata has been enriched by OpenSea, such as collection name and descriptions, will now be available on Instagram.</span></p>\n<h2>Audience Support for Creators</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We’re making it easier for people to show appreciation for their favorite creators across our apps, which helps creators strengthen their community and build their business. </span></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Subscriptions on Instagram</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We’re expanding access to subscriptions on Instagram to all </span><a href=\"https://help.instagram.com/856296695055001?helpref=faq_content\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">eligible creators in the U.S.</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, so more creators can earn predictable income and connect more deeply with their most engaged followers. Since launching subscriptions earlier this year, we’ve seen creators like Cole Sprouse (</span><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/colesprouse\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">@colesprouse</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">), Alan Chow (</span><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alanchikinchow/?hl=en\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">@alanchikinchow</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">) and Skai Jackson (@</span><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/skaijackson\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">skaijackson</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">) use subscriptions to get even closer to their most engaged supporters.</span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-36705\" src=\"https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/03_IG-SUBSCRIPTIONS.png?resize=890%2C775\" alt=\"Product mock of subscriptions on Instagram\" width=\"890\" height=\"775\" srcset=\"https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/03_IG-SUBSCRIPTIONS.png?resize=890%2C775?w=1920 1920w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/03_IG-SUBSCRIPTIONS.png?resize=890%2C775?w=300 300w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/03_IG-SUBSCRIPTIONS.png?resize=890%2C775?w=768 768w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/03_IG-SUBSCRIPTIONS.png?resize=890%2C775?w=1024 1024w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/03_IG-SUBSCRIPTIONS.png?resize=890%2C775?w=1536 1536w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/03_IG-SUBSCRIPTIONS.png?resize=890%2C775?w=1240 1240w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/03_IG-SUBSCRIPTIONS.png?resize=890%2C775?w=689 689w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/03_IG-SUBSCRIPTIONS.png?resize=890%2C775?w=1780 1780w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 890px) 100vw, 890px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<h3><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Stars and Gifts</span></h3>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We are making it easier for people to discover Stars on Facebook by automatically enabling Stars on public creator content — including Reels. This means that people can learn about and use Stars in more places across Facebook. We are testing with a select number of creators globally. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">For creators already using Stars, we’re launching new features to make it easier to earn Stars and interact with Star senders:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Bringing Stars Party to Reels</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. A Stars Party is a Stars community challenge that ends in a celebration if the creator reaches their goal. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Testing a </span><b>new set of virtual gifts tailored to specific content</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. For example, if you’re watching a puppy reel from your favorite pet creator, you’ll be able to send that creator a dog-themed gift. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\"><b>Giving creators more tools to engage with Stars senders</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, like adding a filter in Comments Manager that displays all of a creator&#8217;s Stars comments in one place. In this surface, creators will be able to reply to multiple comments at once</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400\">Bringing Stars to <b style=\"font-family: -apple-system, BlinkMacSystemFont, 'Segoe UI', Roboto, Oxygen-Sans, Ubuntu, Cantarell, 'Helvetica Neue', sans-serif\">non-video public content like photos and text posts</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">.</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-36706\" src=\"https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/04_STARS.png?resize=890%2C775\" alt=\"Product mock of Facebook Stars\" width=\"890\" height=\"775\" srcset=\"https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/04_STARS.png?resize=890%2C775?w=1920 1920w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/04_STARS.png?resize=890%2C775?w=300 300w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/04_STARS.png?resize=890%2C775?w=768 768w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/04_STARS.png?resize=890%2C775?w=1024 1024w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/04_STARS.png?resize=890%2C775?w=1536 1536w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/04_STARS.png?resize=890%2C775?w=1240 1240w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/04_STARS.png?resize=890%2C775?w=689 689w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/04_STARS.png?resize=890%2C775?w=1780 1780w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 890px) 100vw, 890px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We’re introducing</span><b> gifts on Instagram, starting with Reels</b><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">, so creators have a new way to earn money from fans who love their Reels.
