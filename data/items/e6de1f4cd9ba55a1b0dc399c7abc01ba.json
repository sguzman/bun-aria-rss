  "description": "Democrat cover-up of Fetterman's condition is a threat to democracy, they vouched for Fetterman's fitness and the debate last night exposed that as a monstrous lie. Clay says, \"We were setting a low bar with Fetterman. And he was nowhere near that low bar.\" Fetterman gave worst debate performance in anyone's memory. Clay and Buck play clips from the Fetterman-Oz debate, starting with when Fetterman opened the debate with \"Good night\" and never realized that or other mistakes. Journalists and newspapers, including the New York Times, cover for Fetterman. Betting markets tip skyrocket in favor of Oz. Clay says, \"I love betting markets for politics,\" gives his expert analysis of them (after hosting a betting show for years) and Buck says Clay has been tutoring him on it. C&B break down the Zeldin-Hochul debate in New York. Hochul's answer on arresting criminals should seal the deal for Zeldin. Buck says, \"New York ending its descent into the 7th Circle of Hell because of libs has to happen.\" Michigan debate: Whitmer's self-own lie on school closures could tip the race to Tudor Dixon.<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
