  "description": "<p><strong>Eames Demetrios</strong> is the grandson (and namesake) of Charles and Ray Eames and leads the Eames brand which has roared back into the public eye.  His mission is communicating, preserving and extending the brilliant work of designers <strong>Charles and Ray Eames</strong> who were best known by the public for their furniture and for their 125 short films, including the much-heralded-and-still-relevant <strong>Powers of Ten.</strong>  Their Eames Lounge chair for Herman Miller is one of the most popular furniture designs in the world.  Demetrios is also creator of Kcymaerxthaere, a global work of three-dimensional fiction exploring stories of imaginary peoples, movements, even physical laws -- and then memorializing these stories on bronze plaques.  He has written several books about Charles and Ray Eames—Including <strong>An Eames Primer</strong>, <strong>Eames: Beautiful Details</strong>, and <strong>The Furniture of Charles and Ray Eames.</strong></p> <p><strong>Jerry Nowell</strong> ran North Carolina’s first all-contemporary furniture store, names, not surprisingly, Nowell’s Contemporary Furniture.  He was the third generation of Nowell since 1905 to bring exciting designs like the Eames chair and many other  iconic furnishings to the state. In 1968, Nowell's became the first all contemporary furniture store in North Carolina.  It was also among the first furniture stores to challenge the “blue laws” prohibiting sales on Sunday and likely the first to hire black salespeople.  Jerry closed the store a few years ago to spend more time with his family.  The 20,000 sf store is greatly missed as a regional destination for Modernist house owners. </p>",
