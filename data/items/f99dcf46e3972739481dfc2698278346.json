  "description": "<p>On this episode, we’re talking about America’s high rate of recidivism – with nearly 80% of those incarcerated returning to prison after five years – and what can be done to reduce this figure. First, we hear from Marcus Bullock, the founder and CEO of tech company Flikshop, about the obstacles he faced when transitioning back into society after serving an eight-year prison sentence. Marcus applied for 41 jobs before finally finding employment as a paint mixer, opening the door for him to eventually start his own businesses and find ways to help other formerly incarcerated individuals with their reentry journey. Then, host Carla Harris sits down with Marcus Glover, Managing Partner of VC firm Lockstep Ventures, to discuss the real opportunity in breaking down barriers to employment for formerly incarcerated individuals. Marcus outlines the mechanisms in place that lead to reoffending and offers ways that the VC community can leverage its investments to help stem the cycle of recidivism.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.morganstanley.com/what-we-do/inclusive-innovation-and-opportunity\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.morganstanley.com/what-we-do/inclusive-innovation-and-opportunity</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Disclaimer text</em></p><p><em>The guest speakers are neither employees nor affiliated with Morgan Stanley & Co.
