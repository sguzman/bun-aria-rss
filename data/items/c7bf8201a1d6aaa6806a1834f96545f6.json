  "description": "<p>There are hundreds of different diet frameworks available, many of which have proven to be successful for a lot of folks. But the thing is, many of these frameworks promote conflicting information. It’s understandable why so many people are confused about what they should be putting on their plates. At the end of the day, you don’t necessarily need to eat in accordance with a set of rules to be healthy. What really matters is that you eat in a way that works for your lifestyle, your health goals, and your individual needs. </p> <p>Robb Wolf is one of the leading experts in metabolic flexibility and bio individuality. He is a former research biochemist and a two-time New York Times bestselling author. On this episode of The Model Health Show, Robb is here to discuss the link between your diet, your microbiome, and metabolic flexibility. You’re going to learn about finding an individualized approach to eating, and the one diet rule that we should all follow.  </p> <p>This episode is also a deep dive into the role that electrolytes play in human health, including the history and chemistry of electrolytes. You’ll learn about the major electrolytes and their processes in the body, plus how to optimize your electrolyte levels.
