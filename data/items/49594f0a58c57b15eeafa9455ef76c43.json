    "media:description": "Linear differential equations and systems become very complicated once you get beyond the simple cases we have done. Why? The reasons stem from the complexities of factoring polynomials and classifying their roots. To really understand what's going on, you'll need to learn some linear algebra. For now, focus on the basics and you'll be fine.",
