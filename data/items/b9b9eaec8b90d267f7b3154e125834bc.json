  "description": "Dr. Tony Evans says that, whether they realize it or not, people who talk others down are just trying to talk themselves up.  But in this lesson, he’ll explain why that’s the opposite of what happens as he tells us how to recognize symptoms of what the Bible calls unholy speech.  \n\nTo support this ministry financially, visit: https://www.oneplace.com/donate/222/29",
