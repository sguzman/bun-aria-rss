  "description": "<p>The U.S. Mint is producing a new series of quarters featuring American women. The first one, featuring poet Maya Angelou, has just been released. We're learning about coins are made and how images are chosen for money around the world. The US has a law preventing any living person from appearing on its money. Kenya has a new rule preventing any individual people on their money at all. Meanwhile, many countries with kings or queens have those leaders on their money while they’re still in power. Questions we tackle in this episode: How are coins made and how do they get their logos? How are presidents chosen for coins? Why does Lincoln have his shoulder in the picture while other presidents don’t? Why are coins different sizes? What are coins made of? We learn more from Rodney Gillis of the American Numismatic Association and Leigh Gordon of the Royal Australian Mint. </p>\n\n<p>Download our learning guides: <a href=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/26/5d/14e437dc4b0e8672041358678625/how-are-images-chosen-for-coins.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">PDF</a> | <a href=\"https://docs.google.com/presentation/d/1W1jgGqQqK_JFjKo_ssq2OR7t4_xHslFX83-8wlpaMc4/copy\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Google Slide</a> | <a href=\"https://npr.brightspotcdn.com/7d/5b/56e5bfbc4239814b96ab086063df/but-why-172-coins-transcript.pdf\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">Transcript</a></p>\n\n<ul>\n<li><p>Some people like learning about coins so much they collect them!
