  "description": "<p>“Grand Inventions” is a new micro-series within The New Disruptors in which I talk to people whose grandparents or great-x-parents invented something that’s still current or in use today. Two things sparked this micro-series idea for me. First, my grandfather’s stories of making a suggestion during WWII at <a href=\"http://www.mbiconcepts.com/ibm-and-world-war-ii.html\">an IBM wartime manufacturing plant</a> that led to improved impeller productions; second, how invention and entrepreneurialism spans generations.</p>\n\n<p>Joining me for the first episode is <a href=\"https://chrishiggins.com/w/\">Chris Higgins</a>, a documentary filmmaker and writer, whose great-grandfather invented a variety of geared devices that counted things like fuel and people and more, and ultimately became CEO of Veeder-Root. Chris’s great-grandfather was H.L. Spaunberg, and Chris provided a list of some of his patents:</p>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/US2040027A/en?oq=2040027\">Counter</a> (via Frank E.
