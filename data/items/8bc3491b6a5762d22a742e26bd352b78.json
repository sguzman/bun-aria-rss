Li, et al. (2022). Here we have linked the definitions of electric and magnetic polarizabilities to the internal structure of the proton described in the Scale-Symmetric Theory (SST). We then show that we should observe a local enhancement of the polarizabilities (an anomaly) for the squared four-momentum transfer from 0.31 up to 0.42 squared giga-electron volts - it follows from the internal dynamics of the proton. We calculated also the proton polarizability radii and the maximum polarizability for the anomalous region.\n  \n   "
