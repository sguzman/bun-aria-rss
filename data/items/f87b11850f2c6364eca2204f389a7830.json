    "media:description": "In this GIMP Basics tutorial, I show you how to add a transparent gradient to your image or composition! This is a very easy technique that requires some of GIMP's built-in tools and features, including the gradient tool and layer mask. \n\nOnce you've created the transparent gradient effect, you can then export the image with the transparent gradient - which I also show you how to do in this tutorial. So, this is a sort-of bonus two-for-one video! You will learn how to export the photo to a PNG, which supports transparent backgrounds.\n\nGIMP is a free photo editor most similar to Photoshop or Affinity Photo.\n\nVisit our website for more text and video tutorials:\nhttps://www.daviesmediadesign.com/tutorials/\n\nEnroll in Our GIMP Photo Editing Masterclass:\nhttps://www.udemy.com/course/gimp-photo-editing/?referralCode=418C294E695EA3962465\n\nBecome a DMD Premium Member for More GIMP Content:\nhttps://daviesmediadesign.com/premium-membership/\n\nWant to make your GIMP theme look like mine?
