  "description": "Contributor(s): Professor Nichola Raihani, Dr Erez Yoeli, Dr Moshe Hoffman | Reviving game theory, Hoffman and Yoeli use it to explain our most puzzling behaviour, from the mechanics of Stockholm syndrome and internalised misogyny to why we help strangers and have a sense of fairness.
