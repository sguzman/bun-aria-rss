  "description": "<div>What is it like to be a journalist in China? There are obvious restrictions on freedom of speech, but, as Cindy Yu finds out on this episode, there are creative ways to navigate the strict system of censorship. The end result is a complex media landscape - some have to litter investigations with state propaganda; others continue to report on sensitive issues (like the Wuhan Covid cover up) and rely on editors for protection; while growing digitisation and a strongman President continue to threaten what little independence flourished at the beginning of the century.<br>\n<br>\nWith political scientist Maria Repnikova, author of <em>Media Politics in China</em>, and former journalist Fang Kecheng, now an Associate Professor in Journalism at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.</div>\n",
