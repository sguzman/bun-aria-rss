  "description": "<p>     This week Michael and Steve welcome Dania Ramirez (Blanca Selgado) to the podcast. Dania has appeared in Heroes, Entourage, Justice League, Sweet Tooth as well as 5 episodes of the Sopranos. Originally her manager passed on the Sopranos audition but Dania thought he was crazy. It was always one of her favorite shows. </p><p>     Dania was born in the Dominican Republic and never thought she would end up with such a successful career in show business. She talks about how she got her start, and what her family thought about her pursuing a career as an actress. She was really nervous her first day on the Sopranos set and it was James Gandolfini who calmed her down and told her to just relax. Dania has definitely had a very successful acting career but is also a busy entrepreneur involved in a number of projects from making wine to legal cannabis. Currently she is starring in her latest hit <i>Sweet Tooth</i> on Netflix. </p><p>     After Dania’s interview Michael and Steve get into this week’s episode. It’s called “Members Only” and Steve kicks things off by showing some pics of him and Frank Sinatra who is wearing a Members Only jacket…This is the beginning of season six and this episode does not disappoint.
