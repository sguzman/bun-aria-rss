  "description": "The one and only Tim Gombis is in the house today! On a recent blog post, Mr. Gombis asserted that “God is not control”, which spurred on many questions, arguments, disagreements and the like.  On today’s episode, we are discussing what he meant by this statement, if the Bible actually tells us that God is in control, and what we learn about ourselves from holding tightly to this theological statement.  \n\nWe realize that many questions may arise from this conversation which is why this is only Part 1 of our conversation.  We will not only follow up with a part 2 but have a series of podcasts along similar topics and we will follow up with one, long episode about all of it.  However, if you have pressing questions, thoughts or ideas, please email us at hello@voxpodcast.com \n\nIf you want to read Tim’s blog post in it’s totality, you can find it here: https://timgombis.com\n\nLearn more about the VOX Podcast:\nwww.voxpodcast.com\n\nSubscribe on iTunes - apple.co/1Lla1Nj\nSupport the VOX Podcast on Patreon:\n\nwww.patreon.com/voxpodcast\n\nFollow us on Instagram: @voxpodcast\nLike us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/voxpodcast\nFollow Mike on Twitter: www.twitter.com/mikeerre\n\nMusic in this episode by Timothy John Stafford\nwww.timothyjohnstafford.com\nInstagram & Twitter: @GoneTimothy\n",
