Are you living with expectancy knowing that God is bigger than your problems, greater than that sickness, and more powerful than that addiction? Or, are you discouraged, thinking things will never change? It’s time to get your faith back; God is passing by. He has all power.You have to be more determined than what’s trying to stop you if you’re going to reach your potential. In this message, you’ll learn how to release your faith and reach out to God. Many people are waiting on God, but sometimes God is waiting on us to reach out and release our faith. Show God that you’re ready to be healed, ready to be free, ready to go to a new level with your expectancy. It’s time to believe and release your faith!<p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
