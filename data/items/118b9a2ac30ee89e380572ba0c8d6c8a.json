Some individuals out there might feel a little shortchanged if you don’t credit them with their good fortunes. But luck and hard work are two of the hardest ideas to dissociate but that’s what we’re doing today.

And most importantly, it’ll inform us as we’re doing things like setting out to land a new job, spend money more wisely, and invest for our future.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a SLUSHY XL Fruitmine by 450 North Brewing Company, thanks to neighbor Mark for donating this one to the show!
