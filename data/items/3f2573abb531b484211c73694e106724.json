The CLO got something to say to friendzoned and in love.  The fellas tell us what exotic animal they would want to communicate with.  The ladies have the best suggestions for adult beverages from Seagrams Escapes that can take the edge off this weekend.  Should a best friend tell her best friend about her husband's other family?  This round of Would You Rather touches on internet history.  We get a Facebook question about lying and the answers should not shock you.  Junior is back with another episode of Truth Be Told and he was not being nice to a certain member of the show.  Today in Closing Remarks, Steve reminds us to give God something to bless.  You better be ready for what happens next!</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
