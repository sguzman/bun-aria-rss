  "title": "Best of: An inspiring conversation about democracy with Danielle Allen",
  "description": "This conversation with Harvard political theorist Danielle Allen in fall 2019 is one of my all-time favorites. \n \nAllen directs Harvard’s Edmond J. Safra Center for Ethics. She’s a political theorist, a philosopher, the principal investigator of the Democratic Knowledge Project, and the co-chair of a two-year bipartisan commission of the American Academy of Arts & Sciences, which just this year released “Our Common Purpose,” a report with more than 30 recommendations on how to reform American democracy. Her 2006 book Talking to Strangers: Anxieties of Citizenship since Brown v. Board of Education, which forms the basis for this conversation, is the most important exploration of what democracy demands from its citizens that I've ever read. I talk about democracy a lot on this show, but it’s her life’s work\n \nI tried a bunch of different descriptions the first time this episode was released and they all failed the conversation. I had no better luck this time. I loved this one, and, at a moment when the future of democracy looks even darker than it did a year ago, I think you will too. Don’t make me cheapen it by describing it. Just download it.\n\nReferences:\n\"Building a Good Jobs Economy\" by Dani Rodrik and Charles Sabel\nBook recommendations:\n\"Politics and the English Language\" by George Orwell\n\"What America Would Be Like Without Blacks\" by Ralph Ellison\nMen in Dark Times by Hannah Arendt\n\n\nCredits:\nProducer/Audio engineer - Jeff Geld\nResearcher - Roge Karma\n\nPlease consider making a contribution to Vox to support this show: bit.ly/givepodcasts Your support will help us keep having ambitious conversations about big ideas.\n\nNew to the show?
