This reduces the signal latency to levels that allow technologies such as autonomous vehicle control, AR/VR applications, eVTOL, emergency communications, smart factory operation, smart cities, large IoT systems, and more.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.ansys.com/resource-center/webinar/cutting-edge-analysis-of-edge-compute-nodes-5g\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Register now for this free webinar!</a></p><p>In today's 5G systems, EDGE compute nodes are constructed with 5G NR mmWave and sub6 wireless connection capabilities built-in, with WiFi, Bluetooth, and GPS combined with a complex microserver.</p><p>The need for proximity makes designing EDGE nodes complex. Since many nodes are outside and must be weather sealed, you can't use airflow cooling systems. This webinar will show how you can use digital mission engineering software to model EDGE nodes in an extensive system and assess them for signal integrity, power integrity, thermal integrity, structural integrity, antenna systems, and large system deployment.</p>",
