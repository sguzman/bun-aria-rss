  "description": "Finally something passed that targets restaurants, helping food service establishments around the country avoid closure through billions in grants. $28.6 billion of the bill will go to assist restaurants, food trucks, bars, and street vendors in paying their back rent, mortgages, and pretty much anything else. This is not a loan but a non-repayable grant. Grants will be capped at $10 million for restaurant groups and $5 million for individual venues. Publicly traded companies or restaurants with more than 20 locations won’t be eligible. If a restaurant has received a PPP loan, that amount will be subtracted from the potential grant amount. Funds must be used by the end of the year. While something is better than nothing, the initial ask was for $120billion. If you divide the $28.6 billion by the number of eligible restaurants, that comes out to the equivalent of about a $40,000 stimulus check for each restaurant. Is the grant enough? is it the last bit of help restaurants are getting? let us know your thoughts in the comments below!<br /><br />HOW TO APPLY FOR RESTAURANT STIMULUS GUIDE ➜ <a href=\"https://t2m.io\" rel=\"noopener\">https://t2m.io</a>/RestaurantStimmy​<br /><br />#Stimmy​ #Restaurants​ #StimulusChecks​<br />~$44,000 Stimulus Checks For Restaurants? | $28.6 Billion Restaurant Stimulus~<br />⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺⎺<br /><br />Get the latest restaurant and hospitality insider tips and education on saving your restaurant business in our FREE Virtual Event Platform 🎓 <a href=\"https://t2m.io\" rel=\"noopener\">https://t2m.io</a>/VirtualEvents​<br /><br />Subscribe on YouTube ✅ <a href=\"https://t2m.io\" rel=\"noopener\">https://t2m.io</a>/YoutubeSubscribe​<br />Facebook 📱 <a href=\"https://t2m.io\" rel=\"noopener\">https://t2m.io</a>/FoodableFacebook​<br />Twitter 📱 <a href=\"https://t2m.io\" rel=\"noopener\">https://t2m.io</a>/FoodableTwitter​<br /><br />───────────────────────────<br />Want to start your own virtual event or education series?
