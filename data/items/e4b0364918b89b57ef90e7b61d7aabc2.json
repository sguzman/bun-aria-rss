  "description": "<p>On today’s show, the guys discuss The Hardy Boys coming to the office and buying a trampoline for the occasion. They cover the death defying stunts they did off ladders onto the trampoline, Jeff Hardy teaching everyone how to paint their faces, and the setup process that it required. Pat also discusses a couple of his previous houses and the different things that forced him to move to different locations. They also chat about what age you become an adult, what the guys would keep in their purses if it were socially acceptable for men to carry them around, they chat about the NCAA tournament and the PMI bracket challenge on ESPN (#McAfeeForMNF), a man going into a Subway and acting like he worked for another store in order to make himself a sandwich and shorten the cash register and Gorms wonders if he could pull the same stunt. They also dive into whether or not you can get in hot water for flipping off a cop after receiving a ticket, at what age do you become an adult, and debate who the best tag team partner in the office would be. It’s a fun episode, come and have a good time with us.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>This episode features @toddmccomas, @PatMcAfeeShow, @Digz, @nickmaraldo, @tyschmit, @BostonConnr, @HeyGorman, @VivalaZito, and @baileymccomas and closes with a heater from Kid Cudi.</p>\n",
