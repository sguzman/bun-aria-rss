  "description": "Welcome to Weeds 2020! Every other Saturday Ezra and Matt will be exploring a wide range of topics related to the 2020 race. \nSince the Nevada caucuses, Bernie Sanders has become the clear frontrunner in the 2020 Democratic primary, spurring lots of debate over whether he could win in the general election. We discuss where the electability conversation often goes off-the-rails, why discussing electability in 2020 is so different than 1964 or 1972, the case for and against Bernie’s electability prospects, and the strongest attacks that Trump could make against Sanders and Joe Biden. \nThen, we discuss Ezra’s favorite topic of all time: the filibuster. Ezra gives a brief history of this weird procedural tool, and we discuss why so many current Senators are against eliminating it.\n\nResources:\n\"Bernie Sanders can unify Democrats and beat Trump in 2020\" by Matthew Yglesias, Vox\n\"The case for Elizabeth Warren\" by Ezra Klein, Vox\n\"How the filibuster broke the US Senate\" by Alvin Chang, Vox\n\"Running Bernie Sanders Against Trump Would Be an Act of Insanity\" by Jonathan Chait, Intelligencer\n\"The Sixty Trillion Dollar Man\" by Ronald brownstein, Atlantic\n\"The Day One Agenda\" by David Dayen, American Prospect\n\"Bernie Sanders looks electable in surveys — but it could be a mirage\" by David Broockman and Joshua Kalla, Vox\nHosts:\nMatthew Yglesias (@mattyglesias), Senior correspondent, Vox\nEzra Klein (@ezraklein), Editor-at-large, Vox\nNew to the show?
