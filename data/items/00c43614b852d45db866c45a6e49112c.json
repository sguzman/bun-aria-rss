  "description": "Recently, the term culture vulture has been used heavily. Joe, Rory, and Mal debate if Lyor Cohen’s latest interview determines if he is a “culture vulture” (14:22). The guys also share their thoughts on all of the new music that was released starting with Travis Scott’s “Astroworld” (40:32). Most would agree Fabolous is well dressed but Joe gives him a call to discuss an outfit that Mal deemed questionable (1:08:57). And Joe also calls Dame Dash to hear his definition of a “culture vulture” and things heat up quick (1:34:00). Sleeper Picks of the Week Joe: Ella Mai - “Trip” | https://youtu.be/JfGD75vHWrU Rory: Heather Victoria - “Japan” | https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/japan-feat-the-gavin-quintet-single/1420166346 Mal: Red Cafe - “Red Bull” | https://youtu.be/q9Pnw7HKR_k",
