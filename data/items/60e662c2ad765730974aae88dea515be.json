  "title": "Eric Yarbrough, “Transgender Mental Health” (American Psychiatric Association, 2018)",
  "description": "How and where do transgender and gender non-conforming (TGNC) people find good mental healthcare? And how can psychotherapists and other mental health professionals become competent in this kind of care? Furthermore, what are the most important mental health issues faced by TGNC people? These are some of the questions with which TGNC people grapple regularly, and they motivated Dr. Eric Yarbrough to write his new book, Transgender Mental Health (2018, American Psychiatric Association). In our interview, we discuss what it means to be transgender and gender non-conforming, the importance of understanding the gender spectrum, and what gender-affirming mental health treatment looks like. We also address practical questions about how to find good care and what clinicians need to know in order to practice competently. This long-awaited book furthers our understanding about key issues for TGNC people and is a must-read for anyone, client or therapist, engaged with TGNC mental healthcare.\nEric Yarbrough is Director of Psychiatry at Callen-Lorde Community Health Center in New York and President of AGLP: The Association of LGBTQ Psychiatrists. He graduated from University of Alabama School of Medicine and completed his psychiatry residency at St. Luke’s Roosevelt Hospital in New York City.\n\nEugenio Duarte, Ph.D. is a psychologist and psychoanalyst practicing in New York City and Miami. He treats individuals and couples, with specialties in gender and sexuality, eating and body image, and relationship issues. He is a graduate of the psychoanalytic training program at William Alanson White Institute, where he also chairs their monthly LGBTQ Study Group. He is also a contributing author to the book Introduction to Contemporary Psychoanalysis: Defining Terms and Building Bridges (2018, Routledge).\nLearn more about your ad choices.
