  "itunes:author": "Maeve Higgins",
  "description": "On a list of the least funny topics imaginable, the global refugee crisis, border disputes and questions of citizenship are probably close to the top. And yet comedian Maeve Higgins has spent her career finding ways to make jokes about (and make sense of) the ways we draw lines across the globe. She's a stand-up comedian and writer who speaks from the point of view of an Irish immigrant in the United States. In this excerpt from How to Be a Better Human, a TED Audio Collective podcast hosted by Chris Duffy, Maeve talks about ways we can find funny and eye-opening vantage points to look at the realities and borders of the world, our place in it and how imagination and laughter can help us through tough times. We asked Chris to select a book that he thinks explores these topics more deeply, and he selected \"There There\" by Tommy Orange. Listen for his recommendation and why he thinks it's \"like the best action movie and one of the smartest sociological and historical essays paired together.\" This episode is part of the TED Talks Daily summer book club, a series featuring talks and interviews to inspire your next great read.",
