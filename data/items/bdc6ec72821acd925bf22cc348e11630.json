  "description": "In today's podcast, we hear that the US has indicted Iranian hackers. Guccifer 2.0 has been fingered as a GRU team. Inquiries into their activities are folded into Special Counsel Mueller's investigation. Atlanta, Georgia, hit with ransomware. A study estimates the direct cost of the Equifax breach to consumers. App stores show a decline in malware infestations. Facebook leaders speak, finally, but do little to ease the company's pain. An FTC inquiry could be costly. The Cambridge Analytica affair will have implications for regulations, marketing, and consumer trust.  Ben Yelin from UMD CHHS on the Equifax probe being put on ice by the US Consumer Protection agencies. Guest is Kevin Haley from Symantec, on their annual Internet Security Threat Report.",
