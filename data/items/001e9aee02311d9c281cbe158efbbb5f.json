Light the sage, hold those crystals, focus your energies and say a prayer if you need to. Just beware the uninvited. First, doppelganger paranoia in “The Tulpa” an anonymous creepypasta.

And finally, Mary Stockum sees you, Mary Stockum haunts you.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
