  "description": "<p>By now we've all heard the \"grim\" tale of CNN Legal Analyst Jeffrey Toobin. The arch-Trump critic and quasi-celebrity exposed himself to colleagues during a Zoom meeting while masturbating. As the Internet laughed at Toobin's misfortune, Peter Zimmerman, a Professor of History of Education at Penn GSE, got to work on an op-ed for the New York Daily News defending Toobin against the anti-masturbation taboos of post-Enlightenment Western Civilization. Prof. Zimmerman joins us today (0:20:00). Trump lawyer Rudy Giuliani is left explaining an awkward situation about Sacha Baron Cohen's new Borat flick caught released some... odd footage. Big Cat joins the show to exchange apologies with Kirk (1:15:00).</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
