  "description": "In the conclusion of our Cannonball Run series, we explore how the race devolved from a protest against regulation to…less of one. We also examine some of the wackier competitors of the race: a van disguised to look like an ambulance, a group of racers dressed like priests- this one’s kooky folks! We also discuss later attempts at the sea to seas' record, and how people accomplish it today. \nFollow James on IG and Twitter @jamespumphrey \nFollow Nolan on IG and Twitter @nolanjsykes \nFollow Donut @donutmedia, and subscribe to our Youtube and Facebook channels! \nLearn more about your ad choices.
