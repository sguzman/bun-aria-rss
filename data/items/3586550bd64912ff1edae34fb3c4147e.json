  "description": "Clay flies solo in the 3rd hour. Tonight, Biden will use his speech to divide America by saying anyone who votes for Republicans supports fascism. Historic Karine Jean-Pierre says that people who voted for Donald Trump are \"a threat to our democracy, to our freedom, to our rights.\" Another racist hoax exposed at the BYU/Duke volleyball match. We need a Republican House and a Republican Senate to ensure Biden does no more harm to the country. This election is not about Trump, it's about Democrats and their failed, harmful policies. Democrats closed down schools and ensured the poorest Americans were hurt the most.<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
