  "description": "Over the weekend, Recode’s Teddy Schleifer talked with Sam Bankman-Fried, a young cryptocurrency zealot who, seemingly out of nowhere, has a net worth of $10 billion. He cut a low profile until last year, when he became one of Silicon Valley’s biggest contributors to groups supporting Joe Biden, at least in terms of disclosed giving. Bankman-Fried, like many entrepreneurs, thinks obsessively about becoming rich. But he has a two-part plan: First, make a tremendous amount of money by any means necessary. Next, give it all away. \n\nReferences: Read Teddy’s full Q&A here\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
