  "description": "“Sing, O muse, of the rage of Achilles, son of Peleus, that brought countless ills upon the Achaeans.” We're here. The culmination of a dozen episodes and twice as many stories has led to this. Achilles. Helen. Agamemnon. Menelaus. Hector. Odysseus. There's a reason these names are still with us after thousands of years. This is the story of the Trojan War. The creature is pretty much the opposite of an epic, brutal war. It's the not-epic, not-intimidating little Tofu boy!
