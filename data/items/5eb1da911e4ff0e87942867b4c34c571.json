  "description": "Ever wondered what cocktail a fourth-century bishop from Asia Minor would order?  That would be an obscure question to ask if the bishop in question weren't the historical basis for the Santa Claus myth. But since we are dealing here with Nicholas, bishop of the Greek City of Myra, we will delve into the question of what would be the favored drink of a cleric who gave gifts in secret while also getting into fistfights with followers of Arianism. <br /><br />In this special Christmas episode I'm talking with patristics professor Michael Foley. He is the author of the book \"Drinking with Saint Nick.\" In it he compiles holiday drink recipes; beer, wine, and cider recommendations; and instruction on how to pair them with legends of medieval saints.",
