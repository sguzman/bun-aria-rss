Just minutes later police find her car abandoned and locked and she has not been seen since. Where was she going, why did she leave school so quickly and why does this case continue to haunt us 12 years later. The local police believe Maura fled the area running away from her troubles and her family to start a new life. Maura's father believes she was murdered. What happened that night and more importantly where is Maura? This strange case has left many an armchair detective and cyber sleuths obsessed with hunting down any detail about Maura and her movements. Tonight we close the garage doors, open up a beer and discuss the case that refuses to go cold.
