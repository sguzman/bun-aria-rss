  "description": "We have another themed week for you, with two episodes about how to navigate major life changes-- clearly a resonant theme, given the various dumpster fires that are raging in our world right now. Coming up on Wednesday, we’re going to get a deep dharma take on this subject, but today, we’ve got a guest who takes a more journalistic/scientific approach. His name is Bruce Feiler. He has a new, bestselling book called Life Is In the Transitions. In it, he offers seven tools for navigating what he calls “lifequakes,” which can range from divorce to job loss to addiction. Bruce has written a series of bestselling books, including Walking the Bible, and Council of Dads, which became a TV show on NBC. He didn’t mean for this new book on transitions to come out during a pandemic, but the timing is perversely perfect. In this conversation, we talk about: the events in his own life that got him interested in this subject; why “lifequakes” are a feature, not a bug; and why the word “resilience” makes Bruce grumpy.\nWhere to find Bruce Feiler online:\nWebsite: https://www.brucefeiler.com/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/brucefeiler\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/BruceFeilerAuthor/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/brucefeiler/\nBook Mentioned:\nLife Is in the Transitions by Bruce Feiler: https://www.brucefeiler.com/books-articles/life-is-in-the-transitions/\nOther Resources Mentioned:\nJean Piaget's Theory and Stages of Cognitive Development: https://www.simplypsychology.org/piaget.html\nFreud's Psychosexual Stages of Development: https://www.simplypsychology.org/psychosexual.html\nErik Erikson's Stages of Psychosocial Development: https://www.simplypsychology.org/Erik-Erikson.html\nDaniel Levinson on Midlife Crisis: https://pdfs.semanticscholar.org/5e75/2a77fb59cc48e9eea4b1ef4c53056b0f140e.pdf\nElliot Jock on Midlife Crisis: https://www.latimes.com/archives/la-xpm-2003-mar-23-me-jacques23-story.html\nThe Rites of Passage by Arnold van Gennep: https://books.google.com/books/about/The_Rites_of_Passage.html?id=kJpkBH7mB7oC\nWilliam James: https://plato.stanford.edu/entries/james/\nAdditional Resources:\nTen Percent Happier Live: https://tenpercent.com/live\nCoronavirus Sanity Guide: https://www.tenpercent.com/coronavirussanityguide\nFree App access for Frontline Workers: https://tenpercent.com/care\nFull Shownotes: https://www.tenpercent.com/podcast-episode/bruce-feiler-282\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
