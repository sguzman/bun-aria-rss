  "description": "<p>For most of us gardener's around the country, we're currently sitting in that honeymoon phase. It's that time where everything is starting to grow and looking beautiful, but nothing is ready to harvest. However, before we know it the time will be upon us. In this season of the Old Fashioned on Purpose podcast, I'm going to make sure you are able to maximize your bounty while discussing one of my favorite topics in the world; food preservation. Today I'm thrilled to be joined by an expert in colonial food preservation methods, my good friend Jonathan Townsend. In this episode Jonathan discusses a wide range of techniques including many you'll already be familiar with, but he also dives into some very interesting methods like potted meats and smoking. Tune in to find out how you can integrate some of these colonial practices into your modern homestead in order to enhance your preservation methods and better prepare yourself for those long winter months.</p><p>Looking to connect further Jonathan?

I have learned over the years that not all salt is created equal and having the good stuff really does make a difference in your culinary adventures. Redmond’s is the only salt mined in the good ol’ US of A. I love that it’s mined using sustainable practices AND contains 60+ trace minerals that not only make it incredibly good for you, but it tastes better too. Since I can’t grow salt myself (obviously) Right now, Redmond's is offering 15% off your entire order just for my podcast listeners.
