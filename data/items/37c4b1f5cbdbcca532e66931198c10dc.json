  "description": "Ash hadn’t done an old Hollywood case in a while, so upon finding this one dove right in! Christa Helm was born in Milwaukee but knew that she was destined for a life much bigger. She would tell anyone who would listen that she wanted to be a star and no one doubted her ability to get there. Christa moved out to Hollywood to make it big, and while she had some success along the way, the biggest story surrounding Christa would be her murder. Unfortunately Christa’s murder still remains unsolved but it is a wild ride trying to make sense of it all!<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.whokilledchristahelm.com/christasstory\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.whokilledchristahelm.com/christasstory</a><br>\n<br>\nAs always, thank you to our sponsors:<br>\n<br>\nHelloFresh: Get sixteen free meals, plus three gifts, with code morbid16 at <a href=\"http://HELLOFRESH.com/morbid16\" target=\"_blank\">HELLOFRESH.com/morbid16</a><br>\n<br>\nRothy’s: Hit the new year in stride with a fresh pair of Rothy’s.
