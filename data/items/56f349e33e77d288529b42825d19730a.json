  "description": "<p>Friday 6/22 - Today on the show we had mayor of Tallahassee Andrew Gillum, who is now running for governor of Florida, where he spoke about economy change, having kids learn about trade in school and more. Speaking of Florida, you know how Charlamagne loves to give his \"Donkey of the Day\" to people from there, and today he gave it to the man who was charged for the murder of XXX Tentacion, which happened in Miami Florida. Moral of the story, don't get tricked off the street for chasing clout. Speaking of clout we opened up the phone lines to see what our listeners thought, once Fabolous got caught in a girls dm and she blasted him on social media for it, but was she clout chasing, according to Fab she was. </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
