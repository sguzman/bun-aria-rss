  "title": "275: Improving Your Relationships, Buddhist Style | Martine Batchelor",
  "description": "This episode is a mix of the technical, the practical, and the delightful. We’re talking about a meditation technique that can impact relationships, your biases, and how you handle things such as lying, sex, alcohol, and social media. The key word here is the ancient term \"vedana.\" And it involves, literally, any feeling state we experience. Basically, everything that comes up in your mind has one of at least three feeling tones: pleasant, unpleasant, or neutral. When you’re mindless, a pleasant feeling tone can lead to overindulgence or clinging; unpleasant can lead to aversion; and neutral can lead to numbing out. Unchecked, this unfolding process can have disastrous results, as it pertains to your reactions to food, other people, you name it. My guest today is going to tell us about how to bring mindfulness to this aspect of our experience. Martine Batchelor was a Buddhist nun in Korea for 10 years. She’s written a number of books, including The Path to Compassion and Let Go: A Buddhist Guide to Breaking Free of Habits. She lives in France, with her husband Stephen Batchelor, who was a guest on the show not long ago.\nWhere to find Martine Batchelor online:\nWebsite: https://martinebatchelor.org/\nMartine Batchelor's Dharma Talks - https://dharmaseed.org/teacher/119/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/martinebatch\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/martine.batchelor\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/martinebatch/\nWe care deeply about supporting you in your meditation practice, and feel that providing you with high quality teachers is one of the best ways to do that.
