  "description": "<p>I will be welcoming Donald to the show. He encountered a Sasquatch late one night and wasn’t sure what he was looking at.</p> <p>Donald says “I was out with friends in the middle of nowhere and I watching this strange eyeshine, it looked like one eye not two.</p> <p>I thought was a cougar. I decided it would be better to leave. I was trying to turn the car around on this little country road and that is when the headlights lit this creature up. I can explain to you what it looked like, it was only 8 feet from my headlights standing in the tree line like a statue. Before I explain to you what I saw, this thing was injured. It looked like it was in a fight or something because the other eye was all mangled. Now I understand why only one eye was giving off eyeshine….”</p>",
