  "description": "<p>The body of Gloria Satterfield, longtime housekeeper for disgraced South Carolina lawyer Alex Murdaugh, will be exhumed. Satterfield died after a trip and fall accident at the Murdaugh home. No autopsy was performed and her manner of death listed as natural. Now,  after the string of deaths linked to the Murdaugh name, investigators want to know more.  Exhumations are not ordered for just any old case, but when a court orders the  embalmed remains of a human being be uninterred,  everyone pays attention, including our forensics expert Joseph Scott Morgan.   In this episode of Body Bags, Joseph Scott Morgan and Jackie Howard discuss what exhumation is, and why exhumation must be handled with the utmost of care.  </p>\n<p>Subscribe to Body Bags with Joseph Scott Morgan :</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/body-bags-with-joseph-scott-morgan/id1587763116\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\" data-linkindex=\"0\"><strong>Apple Podcasts</strong></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/385AEt9XDYJoCyWtGZo3bw?si=j4zNy8vhQISmIFTA0HvASg&dl_branch=1\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\" data-linkindex=\"1\"><strong>Spotify</strong></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.iheart.com/podcast/269-body-bags-with-joseph-scot-87375583/\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\" data-linkindex=\"2\"><strong>iHeart</strong></a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
