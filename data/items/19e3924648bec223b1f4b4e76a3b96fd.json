  "description": "<p>The first ever mystery guest of the Kirk Minihane Show joins us tonight in studio. We don't want to hype this too much, so we'll give you a few hints: He always dreamed of being on a major podcast, he should probably learn Albanian, and he's a world class fencer. Kirk analyzes the much-coveted Boomer interview on WEEI's Greg Hill Morning Show (0:17:20). Peaks and valleys with Minifan callers (0:42:00). Big Cat joins the program to settle a Bruce Springsteen-related dispute (1:22:30).</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music. For more, visit <a href=\"https://barstool.link/kminshow\">barstool.link/kminshow</a></p>",
