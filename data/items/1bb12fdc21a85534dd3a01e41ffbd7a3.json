Robin plays Edee, a woman experiencing tremendous grief who decides to leave her life in the city to live in a cabin in the wilderness. “It’s about the existence you once knew, that you once lived in will never exist in the same way again,” she says, “and I just thought, wow, that’s something to explore.” And with 2021 already proving to be a standout year for women in film — with more women premiering at Sundance and more female directors nominated for Golden Globes — Robin addresses Hollywood’s glass ceiling and whether the cracks are finally making an impact on the industry. ‘Land’ is playing in select theaters now and will be available on PVOD March 5.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
