  "description": "Data science has been a hot term in the past few years. Despite this fact (or perhaps because of it), it still seems like there isn't a single unifying definition of data science. This post discusses my favourite definition.\nData Scientist (n.): Person who is better at statistics than any software engineer and better at software engineering than any statistician.\nâ€” Josh Wills (@josh_wills) May 3, 2012\nOne of my reasons for doing a PhD was wanting to do something more interesting than &ldquo;vanilla&rdquo; software engineering."
