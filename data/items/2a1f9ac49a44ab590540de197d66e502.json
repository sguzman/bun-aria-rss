  "description": "<p>Caterpillars go through a striking transformation from a crawly, tube-like creature into a soaring, beautifully-winged butterfly. This process is called metamorphosis and it’s no wonder our listeners have lots of questions about it. We’ll find out exactly how a caterpillar transforms (spoiler alert: it doesn’t just grow a pair of wings), and we’ll go on a house-hunting journey with two caterpillars searching for their pupation stations. Plus, a pretty tricky mystery sound for you to guess!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This episode was sponsored by:</p>\n<p>Insect Lore (<a href=\"http://insectlore.com/\" class=\"default\">insectlore.com</a>)<br>Shopify (<a href=\"http://shopify.com/brainson\" class=\"default\">shopify.com/brainson</a> for a 14 day trial)<br>Galileo Camps (<a href=\"http://galileo-camps.com/\" class=\"default\">Galileo-camps.com</a> - promo code: FUNSUMMER2022 for $100 off camp)<br>Pinna (<a href=\"https://PINNA.FM/BRAINSON\" class=\"default\">Pinna.fm/BrainsOn</a> - promo code: BRAINSON for 50% off your first payment when you sign up for Pinna full access)<br></p>\n",
