There was loud abrasive anger: Linkin Park, Staind and Eminem. Hyperactive teenaged immaturity: blink-182, Sum 41 and American Hi-Fi. Plus Max Martin-produced pop bubblegum: Britney Spears and N*Sync. And Andrew WK contained shades of all of the above. \n\nHeavier than almost anything else in the mainstream, but sugary sweet like the purest pop, his debut single was a Vodka Redbull smashed into your ear canal, an punishingly uplifting tune released in the aftermath of the worst tragedy to befall the US in living memory. This is the story of “Party Hard” and How Andrew WK is not who you think he is.\n\nThis video is sponsored by Surfshark.\n\nFact-checking by Serenity Autumn.\n\nSoundtrack\nLuar - Oblivion (https://soundcloud.com/luarbeats)\nJesse Gallagher - The Golden Present\nLuar - Anchor (https://soundcloud.com/luarbeats)\n\n00:00 Prologue\n02:14 An Introduction: Who is Andrew WK?\n06:23 I Love NYC: \"You Can't Stop What You Can't End\"\n10:21 Party Hard: \"And Everything is All Right\"\n16:16 But Really...
