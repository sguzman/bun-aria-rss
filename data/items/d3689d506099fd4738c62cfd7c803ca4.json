  "description": "<p>Rebekah Taussig is a Kansas City writer and teacher with her doctorate in Creative Nonfiction and Disability Studies. For the last five years, she’s grown a global community on Instagram, where she crafts these “mini-memoirs” that take you into her world, experiences and identity, a part of which includes her near lifelong relationship with physical disability and the wheelchair that has given her freedom and mobility and much more. Rebekah’s memoir in essays, <em>Sitting Pretty: The View from My Ordinary Resilient Disabled Body (</em>https://amzn.to/3mgFNEw) takes you into her life, creating an eye-opening, funny, and insightful portrait of a body that looks and moves differently than most. In today’s conversation, we dive into all of this. I learned so much not just about Rebekah, her family, life and mindset, but also her passion for writing and creativity and people.&nbsp;</p><br><p>You can find Rebekah Taussig&nbsp;at:</p><p><a href=\"https://rebekahtaussig.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a>&nbsp;: https://rebekahtaussig.com/</p><p>-------------</p><p>Have you discovered your&nbsp;Sparketype&nbsp;yet?&nbsp;Take the Sparketype Assessment™ now.
