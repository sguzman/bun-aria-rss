Too often it’s thought that health is for the rich or privileged that can afford high quality care, but when researchers and physicians begin to share how easy and accessible better health is for everyone, it’s time to really pay attention. Dr. William Li is an internal medicine doctor from the Harvard Medical School Faculty that studies angiogenesis, and is the author of the best-selling book, Eat To Beat Disease. Dr. Li is breaking down the 5 natural body defenses protecting you at all times, even right now, and exactly how powerful foods are that can prevent disease in your body. This interview feels like part of the missing chronicles of optimizing your health to a level you never knew existed, and there’s nothing complicated about it.   Order Dr. William Li’s book, Eat to Beat Disease: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3DWuDhT\" rel=\"noopener\">https://amzn.to/3DWuDhT</a>   SHOW NOTES:   0:00 | Introduction William Li 0:53 | Defining Real Health 4:39 | 5 Health Defense Systems 11:00 | Hiding Cancer in the Body 18:00 | Cellular Profiling Cancer 23:07 | Microbiome & Immune System 33:03 | Medicinal Food Power 40:49 | Explaining Angiogenesis 45:15 | Eating to Beat Disease   QUOTES:   “In most people's minds, including mine, not being sick is kind of the default definition of being healthy.
