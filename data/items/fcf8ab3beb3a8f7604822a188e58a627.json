Brown is a sought-after presenter, panelist, and trainer with over two decades of experience in the legal and leadership arenas. From a young age, growing up in a marginalized community, she saw first-hand the challenges and obstacles that those with similar backgrounds encountered in society. She came to the realization that in order to change the outcome, one had to have a place and a voice at the table.\nUpon graduating from law school, Judge Brown served as a public defender fighting for all those who did not traditionally have a voice—the low income, the immigrant, those suffering from mental health challenges, anyone who did not have access to their constitutional right of appropriate representation. She argued several high-profile cases that were noted in the media and written about in local and regional publications. In 2011, California Governor Jerry Brown appointed Shelyna V. Brown to the bench in Santa Clara County.\nJudge Brown has served on several boards and has been recognized for her excellence in advocacy and praised for her contributions to the community. She was awarded numerous honors and accolades, including Excellence in Advocacy from the 100 Black Women of Silicon Valley, the Ivy Rose Foundation named her the first recipient of the Distinguished Women of Silicon Valley Awards, and the Silicon Valley Business Journal listed her as one of the 100 Women of Influence. Judge Brown was honored by the Silicon Valley NAACP with the Wester Sweet Award for Legal Activism, she is the most recent recipient of the Santa Clara Law School Social Justice and Human Rights Award, and she received a Congressional Commendation from Congresswoman Zoe Lofgren.\nFrom nonprofits to universities to global corporations including Stanfo\n",
