  "description": "The coronavirus vaccines that have been approved so far all require two doses to be given 3-4 weeks apart. But the UK has chosen to <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24933173-700-is-the-uk-right-to-delay-the-second-dose-of-the-covid-19-vaccines/'>delay the time between doses</a> to 12 weeks, so it can roll out the vaccine to more people more quickly. This week the team examines whether this is the right move, and whether it’s safe. Also on the show, they explore the incredible potential that could be achieved if we’re able to design a <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/mg24933170-900-the-superconductor-breakthrough-that-could-mean-an-energy-revolution/'>superconductor that can operate at room temperature</a>, including high speed travel, super-fast computers and ultra-efficient renewable energy. They also discuss the huge biodiversity issue that is coral loss, and how a team of researchers on Heron Island is helping to boost corals on the Great Barrier Reef. Then there’s news from Saudi Arabia’s crown prince, and his plans for a new zero carbon city, and an exposé on the <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/2264340-megalodon-sharks-grew-2-metres-long-in-the-uterus-by-eating-eggs/'>cannibalistic tendencies of ancient megalodon sharks</a>. On the panel are Rowan Hooper, Tiffany O’Callaghan, Clare Wilson, Donna Lu and Michael Brooks.
