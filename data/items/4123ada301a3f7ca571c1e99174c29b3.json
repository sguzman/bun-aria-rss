  "itunes:summary": "Armour Group are experimental, atmospheric and conceptual, their music rooted in the traditions of the power electronics/death industrial genre. Through their use of extreme minimal electronics accented by samples drawn from cult cinema, broadly referencing serial killings, murder, disaster, misanthropy, immoral acts, relationships, love and betrayal, they aim beyond brutality to incite feelings of euphoria and affirmation, as well as evoking the impending demise of our current culture and natural surroundings.\n\nhttps://liquidarchitecture.org.au/events/puce-mary-melbourne\n\nRitual Community Music\nThe Tote, Melbourne\n21 August 2016\nPresented by Liquid Architecture, Audio Foundation and The Tote\n\nImage: Lloyd Honeybrook\n\nFinancial support from patrons at any level has a resounding impact on our work.
