Her friend dropped Melanie off, and surveillance cameras at the Chesapeake Glen Apartments in Glen Burnie, Maryland, captured Melanie walking into the building where she shared an apartment with her boyfriend. Melanie was never seen exiting the apartment building. However, the cameras didn’t capture high-quality images, and they couldn’t see people coming and going after dark. Melanie’s friends tried to reach her the following day but were unsuccessful. Melanie failed to show up for work on Friday evening, which was out of character. By Saturday, her friends were alarmed and decided to report Melanie missing.
