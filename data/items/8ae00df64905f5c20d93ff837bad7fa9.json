  "description": "<p>Jeff Ross met me in Washington Square Park to talk about delis. We're both Ashkenazi Jews so it's a no brainer that we each have our opinions on the matter. But we also got other people in on the fun and went around interviewing people in the street about their favorite delis. Jeff was really busy planning the Comedy Central shoot of the Roast Battle, so we didn't get that much time to talk. So I made up for it a little with a long intro about the beach and a long outro about Shroomfest 2016. Make sure to set your DVRs to record the Roast Battle July 28-31 at 10/9c on Comedy Central. A new round every night until the live final round on Sunday, July 31.</p>",
