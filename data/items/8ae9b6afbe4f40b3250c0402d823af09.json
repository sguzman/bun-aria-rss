Did some work on seasonalities recently and applied it to the stock market to quantify the truthfulness of this statement.</p>\n<p><span id=\"more-3351\"></span></p>\n<p>The video recording is available from <a href=\"https://youtu.be/6Ho88QvcLjs\">my YouTube channel</a>.</p>\n<p>First the methodology. To discover seasonalities, I decided to split each year in equal (or approximately equal) periods. The most natural period is a single month, and that&#8217;s what I started with. Later, I went a bit further by dividing each month into two. Thus, 24 periods per year, of approximately the same length.</p>\n<p>Then, I run a python script to pull out some statistics for the various single periods (Dow Jones Industrial Average, 30 years of history):</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dj30.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dj30-720x395.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"395\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-3352\" srcset=\"https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dj30-720x395.png 720w, https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dj30-240x132.png 240w, https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dj30-768x421.png 768w, https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dj30.png 1053w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Notice the highlighted unusual weakness during June and August. The statistics over 15 years of history are similar:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dj15.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dj15-720x395.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"395\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-3353\" srcset=\"https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dj15-720x395.png 720w, https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dj15-240x132.png 240w, https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dj15-768x422.png 768w, https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dj15.png 1051w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Thus, the summer months are often weak. Indeed, my script failed to find any multi-period sequences which has been strong historically including these months (June, July or August). The conclusion: the summer is indeed weak.</p>\n<p>Interestingly enough, based on similar analysis we are currently in a strong period for the stock market. Here is an example:</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dj30strong.png\"><img loading=\"lazy\" src=\"http://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dj30strong-720x150.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"720\" height=\"150\" class=\"aligncenter size-large wp-image-3354\" srcset=\"https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dj30strong-720x150.png 720w, https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dj30strong-240x50.png 240w, https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dj30strong-768x160.png 768w, https://www.quintuitive.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/dj30strong.png 857w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 720px) 100vw, 720px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Mid-March until end of April has been strong historically. Apparently what has been developing this year is a deviation, unless the market rallies into the end of the month.</p>\n<p>All in all, the summer weakness is there, and if history is to repeat &#8211; there might be further troubles for the stock market. Combine that with <a href=\"http://www.quintuitive.com/2018/03/24/the-bull-barely-survived-on-friday/\">the recent Dow Theory sell signal</a>, and the situation starts to look gloomy. At least for the near term future.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.quintuitive.com/2018/04/14/seasonalities-near-term-future-market/\">Seasonalities: The Near-Term Future for the Market</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.quintuitive.com\">Quintuitive</a>.</p>\n",
