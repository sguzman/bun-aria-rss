  "description": "We had a full week this week!  Brian Williams was suspended without pay for 6 months. An Atheist progressive opened fire on 3 innocent Muslims and University of Michigan took one more step toward banning free speech.  We discuss all of that in this week’s Louder With Crowder, but more importantly, I was joined by radical feminist, environmentalist Lierre Keith. Surprisingly, we agreed on a lot and she educated us on some of the most common, but patently false vegetarian myths and claims! Full video- interview and podcast below!   Be sure to SUBSCRIBE ON ITUNES so that you can take the show with you on the go!",
