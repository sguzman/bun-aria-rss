  "description": "This we week we welcome theologian and activist Shane Claiborne. Together we discuss one of his recent books “Beating Guns” and wrestle with gun reform, and the 2nd Amendment in light of a Gospel-centered worldview. \n\nWe ask questions about if it is a gun problem, heart problem or both. What about self defense? What should we do with out fear? How shall we interpret the 2nd Amendment? How shall we interpret the words of Jesus? \n\nPart of Shane’s work is working with RAWtools, an organization which accepts guns from those who have voluntarily unarmed themselves and turn these weapons into gardening tools. You can find out how to get involved here: https://rawtools.org/\n\nLearn more about the VOX Podcast:\nwww.voxpodcast.com\n\nSubscribe on iTunes - apple.co/1Lla1Nj\nSupport the VOX Podcast on Patreon:\n\nwww.patreon.com/voxpodcast\n\nFollow us on Instagram: @voxpodcast\nLike us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/voxpodcast\nFollow Mike on Twitter: www.twitter.com/mikeerre\n\nMusic in this episode by Timothy John Stafford\nwww.timothyjohnstafford.com\nInstagram & Twitter: @GoneTimothy\n",
