  "description": "Prior to the wave of protests in 2017 supporting immigrants in the US, there were the protests of 2006. That spring, millions of Latinos and other immigrants across the country opposed Congressional action hostile to immigrants. These protesters participated in one of the largest movements to defend immigrant and civil rights in US history. In Latino Mass Mobilization: Immigration, Racialization, and Activism (Cambridge University Press, 2017), Chris Zepeda-Millan surveys the strategies and impacts of this unprecedented wave of protests, focusing on the unique local, national, and demographic dynamics, as well as the role of the ethnic media. Latino Mass Mobilization is an important addition to contemporary debates regarding immigration policy, social movements, and immigrant rights activism in the US and elsewhere.\n\nZepeda-Millan is assistant professor of comparative ethnic studies and Chicano/Latino Studies at UC Berkeley.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
