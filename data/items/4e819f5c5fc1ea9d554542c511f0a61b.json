  "description": "Most kids are not spending their time in solitude exploring the abilities of the mind. In that way, Narayan Liebenson was not like most kids. Fascinated with the mind since a young age, she has led a life studying meditation in different traditions. Her training over the past forty years includes study with meditation masters in the Theravada, Zen, and Tibetan traditions. In 1985, Liebenson co-founded the Cambridge Insight Meditation Center, which describes itself as \"an urban refuge and teaching center for all who seek inner peace through the liberating practice of Insight Meditation.\" She is also the author of the recently released book, \"The Magnanimous Heart: Compassion and Love, Loss and Grief, Joy and Liberation.\" In it, and in our discussion, she describes how to move from the \"constant squeeze\" of suffering to a direct experience of what she calls \"enough-ness.\" We also discuss how that concept relates to the Buddhist teaching of \"Hungry ghosts,\" creatures with huge stomachs and tiny mouths, who always remain hungry.\nPlug Zone\nNew Book \"The Magnanimous Heart: Compassion and Love, Loss and Grief, Joy and Liberation\"\nhttps://www.amazon.com/Magnanimous-Heart-Compassion-Grief-Liberation/dp/1614294852\nCambridge Insight Meditation Center: https://cambridgeinsight.org/about/teachers/\nTo donate to the Cambridge Insight Meditation Center: https://cambridgeinsight.org/generosity/unrestricted-gift-dana/\nTen Percent Happier Meditation – Oren Jay Sofer's Practicing Kindness:\nhttps://10percenthappier.app.link/3nu2IRiOiX\n***VOICEMAILS***\nHave a question for Dan?
