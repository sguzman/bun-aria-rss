  "description": "<p>We show that any translate of a model set is a model set in some modified\ncut-and-project scheme. Restricting to Euclidean direct space, we show that any\ntranslate of an inter model set is a model set in some modified cut-and-project\nscheme with second countable internal space. In both cases, the window in the\nmodified cut-and-project scheme inherits the topological and measure-theoretic\nproperties of the original window. Our results hold in fact for a class beyond\ninter model sets, which we call almost model sets.\n</p>",
