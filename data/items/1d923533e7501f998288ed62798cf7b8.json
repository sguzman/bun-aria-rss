  "description": "One of the most powerful families in American history has been beset by tragedy since they first set foot on American soil. Multiple plane crashes, two political assassinations, cancer, drug overdoses, suicide. Think of something horrible and it has almost certianly happened to the Kennedy's. Some blame an old Irish curse for their endured hardships while others believe a large family with high risk professions and a domineering father is the cause. Whatever the reason one thing is for certain - you do not want to be a Kennedy.\nSupport Sinisterhood\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
