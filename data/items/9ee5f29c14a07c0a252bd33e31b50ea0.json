  "description": "<p>EPISODE 41 - PAUL DANO & ZOE KAZAN -Actors, writers & director</p> <p>Team Deakins has the pleasure of speaking with another couple in the film business. Both are actors and writers and Paul has also directed. We talk a lot about the experience of being an actor and they articulately discuss the difference between acting for the stage and for film. We talk about the experience of being a couple in the same business and working together. Zoe shares how her writing allows her acting to be more personal and how hard it is to write a project and then let it go once it is picked up to be made. We had the opportunity to ask Paul many questions on his wonderful debut film as a director, “WILDLIFE”. We also touched on actors and their awareness of the camera, actors and continuity, their pet peeves about actors and how they choose their projects. Zoe speaks about working with the Coen Brothers and Paul speaks about working with Denis Villeneuve. We cover a lot of ground in this episode!</p> <p>RECOMMENDED EPISODE VIEWING: Wildlife, The Ballad of Buster Scruggs</p>",
