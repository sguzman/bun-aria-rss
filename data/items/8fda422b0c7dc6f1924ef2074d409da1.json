It starts out as sand and with tons of heat, and a few key ingredients, it becomes the super useful material we know and love. In this episode we look at how glass is made, why it's clear and how nature  makes glass too. Plus, hear about Sanden's latest invention and guess the all new Mystery Sound.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This episode is sponsored by</p>\n<ul>\n<li><p>Indeed (<a href=\"http://indeed.com/BRAINSON\" class=\"c-link\">Indeed.com/BRAINSON</a> - to start hiring now. <em>Terms and conditions apply.
