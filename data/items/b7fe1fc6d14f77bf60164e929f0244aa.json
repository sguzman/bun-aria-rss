  "description": "<p>To discuss the ongoing COVID-19 pandemic, we are introducing Anatomy of a Pandemic, a series in which each episode tackles a particular aspect of COVID-19, from virus biology to clinical disease, from control efforts to epidemiological patterns, from vaccine development to mental health coping strategies during this uncertain time. And we’ve got a quarantini (and placeborita) recipe for each installment! In the first episode of this series, we tackle some of your questions about SARS-CoV-2, the virus that is responsible for COVID-19 (aka <strong>CO</strong>rona<strong>VI</strong>rus <strong>D</strong>isease-20<strong>19</strong>). Our episode begins with a firsthand account from Tiziano, a schoolteacher in northeastern Italy who has been living under the strict movement restrictions imposed by the Italian government in an attempt to limit the spread of the disease. Then, we review some of the basics about SARS-CoV-2 and RNA viruses in general. To help us discern fact from fiction, we seek the expertise of a virologist, Dr. Angela Rasmussen (interview recorded March 15, 2020), who answers some of the listener-submitted questions about the virus itself. We wrap up the episode by discussing the top five things we learned from our expert. To help you get a better idea of the topics covered in this episode, we have listed the questions below:</p><ol><li>What are the origins of this virus? Where did it come from?</li><li>How can we tell whether this virus originated from one spillover event or multiple?</li><li>What do we know about the mechanism of how this virus causes disease in humans?</li><li>Are there multiple strains of SARS-CoV-2, and how do different strains of virus affect disease severity?&nbsp;</li><li>Is there a risk of SARS-CoV-2 mutating into something more deadly?&nbsp;</li><li>What is Remdesivir and how does it work?&nbsp;</li><li>How does handwashing work to reduce transmission risk?</li><li>How long can SARS-CoV-2 live on surfaces?&nbsp;</li><li>What is the minimum infective dose of SARS-CoV-2?</li></ol><p><br></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
