  "description": "<p>Today, I’m sharing an episode from a new podcast I’ve been enjoying, Well-Read Black Girl, from Pushkin Industries. Glory Edim, author and founder of the Well-Read Black Girl community, sits in deep, honest and close conversation with authors like Tarana Burke, Anita Hill, Gabrielle Union, Brit Bennett and more. You’ll also meet literacy advocates and Black booksellers to hear what they’re reading and what it means to be well-read. In this episode, Glory talks with Korean American author and teacher Min Jin Lee. Min talks about what she learned about resistance from bell hooks, how the work she does on and off the page challenges society, and how she’s mentoring a new generation of writers of color.
