That’s what we’re going to talk about today- the pros and the aspects and behaviors that it encourages that we love. But we’re also going to cover the cons of FIRE and how certain actions could actually keep us from attaining the goals we’re truly seeking.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Fruit and Hops on the Bottom which is a collaboration between Stillwater and Hoof Hearted Brewing!
