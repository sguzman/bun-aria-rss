  "description": "Good evening… this is Otis Jiry, host of _Scary Stories Told in the Dark_. I hope you’ve enjoyed the first season of the program, and all 24 episodes. Myself and the team at Chilling Entertainment and the Simply Scary Podcasts Network are hard at work on Season 2, which begins right on schedule this upcoming Wednesday, May 16, now with three *free* stories per episode. But, in case you who just can’t wait until next week for your fill of frights, you’re in luck, as I come to you today with the gift that keeps on giving. If you don’t already know, mine is not the only horror audio drama on the Simply Scary network. We also produce the program that started it all, the _Simply Scary Podcast_, which frequently features yours truly, and which just launched its third season this past Tuesday. Season 3, episode 1 features me in a starring role, so don’t miss it. (You can see that episode here: http://www.simplyscarypodcast.com/series/the-simply-scary-podcast/3x01/) If you’re not a subscriber to the _Simply Scary Podcast_, you can find them also on SimplyScaryPodcast.com, as well as on iTunes, Stitcher, Google Play, Spotify, and wherever else podcasts are found. And if you’re just discovering our friends over there, you’ve got a lot of catching up to do, and there are more than 30 episodes for you to satisfy your taste for terror with. Also on the network is our brand new program, _Horror Hill_, starring _Chilling Tales for Dark Nights_ fan-favorite Jason Hill as both host and narrator. Jason’s show is for mature audiences only, is not for those faint of heart, and features a wide range of anthology horror from both published and unpublished authors, complete with sound effects and music. So if you’re interested in losing any more sleep, he’s got your fix every Thursday night. For those of you listening in now and supporting me, I wanted to go the extra mile and make it easy to experience what it’s like over at the Horror Hill… so, with the kind permission of Jason, I present to you the latest episode of his program, in its entirety, here on my feed. If you enjoy what you hear, please subscribe to _Horror Hill_ on iTunes or your podcast app of choice, leave him a 5-star review, and post a kind word if you feel so inclined. It would bring a smile to this old storyteller’s face to see fans of my show enjoy his as well. From all of us here at the Simply Scary Podcasts Network, where we like to give you more horror than you can handle…. stay spooky… and enjoy the show… and I’ll see you next week for the debut of Season 2 of _Scary Stories Told in the Dark_. See full episode details, including the text of the featured stories, here:http://www.simplyscarypodcast.com/series/horror-hill/s1e14-hh/\nLearn more about your ad choices.
