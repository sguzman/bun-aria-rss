  "description": "On today’s show, Pat and the boys record from the back of the box truck in beautiful Atlanta, Georgia.They are joined by 6x Pro Bowler, All-Pro, former Bills defensive tackle and friend of the show, Kyle Williams. They discuss his thoughts on the Colin Kaepernick situation and how it seems to be getting worse for everyone, what defensive linemen can try to do to neutralize Lamar Jackson (if that’s possible), Kyle gives his thoughts on the Bills season so far, what coach Sean McDermott is like, whether or not they have a legitimate shot to make a run in the playoffs, and chats about life from his duck hunting camp in Louisiana (3:16-16:48). Next, 2x Pro Bowler, Pro Bowl MVP, the man who made one of the nicest catches in NFL history a couple of weeks ago, Minnesota Vikings TE Kyle Rudolph joins the show. Kyle and Pat discuss what has fundamentally changed for the Vikings since the big public meltdown early in the season, what Kirk Cousins demeanor is like in the huddle, locker room, and sidelines, how big of a threat the Vikings are moving forward when they’re healthy, whether Mike Zimmer has relented in his coaching style at all over the course of the season, his plans for the bye week, and if he’s gotten to pay much attention to the other elite teams in the NFC that the Vikings may face down the road (16:50-29:35). Pat also discusses the College Football Playoff Committee’s new rankings and how he sees everything shaking out, breaks down the 4 primetime games in the NFL this week which are some of the marquee matchups of the season, reacts to Le’Veon Bell being drug tested for HGH multiple times by the NFL over the last few weeks, and with Christmas being right around the corner, the guys get into a heated debate about what their top 3 Christmas movies of all-time are. It’s a fun one. Come laugh with us, cheers.\n",
