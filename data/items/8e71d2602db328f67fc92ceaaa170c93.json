  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, President Biden has called for a gas tax holiday, something that Barack Obama and Nancy Pelosi have called a gimmick since it does nothing to address increasing domestic oil production, which would offset the price. It's simple supply and demand economics, yet Biden refuses to allow any oil drilling on leased land controlled by the federal government. Sadly, Biden cowers to the Sierra Club and leftwing radical environmentalists to decrease production which drives up the cost and forces Americans out of their cars and into public transportation in the name of an environmental emergency, and the same will happen with single-family housing. Then, Biden continues to claim that inflation was caused by the war in Ukraine, yet the Federal Reserve chairman admits that inflation was high even before the war. The ruling class is incompetent and largely unreliable. Later, former Tallahassee Mayor Andrew Gillum was charged with 21 federal indictments for wire fraud, conspiracy, and making false statements. Gillum denies any wrongdoing and has withdrawn from public life after being discovered unconscious from an overdose in a motel with a male companion. Afterward, Congresswoman Lauren Boebert calls in to discuss her re-election campaign. Boebert added that she has opposition but remains focused on serving her constituents in Colorado.\n\n June 22, lauren boebert, boebert, Colorado, oil, gas, gas prices, gas tax, TRANSPORTATION, CARS, travel, lithium batteries, lithium battery, lithium, diesel, truckers, inflation, UKRAINE, PUTIN, Jerome powell, powell, Retirement, 401k, andrew Gillum, Gillum, establishment, gun control, gun, Ukraine, Russia\nLearn more about your ad choices.
