  "title": "#342: Devil In Disguise: Honoring the Victims and Deconstructing a Serial Rapist/Killer' - Part 1",
  "description": "<p>In our new series, we deconstruct prolific serial killer John Gacy (JG) who raped and murdered&nbsp;<em>at least</em>&nbsp;33 teenage boys in the Chicago area in the late 70s. Throughout this series we refer to him as JG as unfortunately this killer has received so much notoriety in life behind bars that it has obscured the names of the victims he killed and we do not want to contribute to that. We want to&nbsp;reframe this case and honour the victims.</p><p>&nbsp;Jim and Laura analyze JG's behavior and explain how he was able to target his victims and avoid discovery. We discuss the many mis-steps of law enforcement and the criminal justice system that allowed JG to offend for as long as he did.&nbsp;Across our series we use the Peacock documentary called “Devil in Disguise” as a framework for our discussion and analysis, so check it out and listen to our series or you can just dive into our episodes.
