  "description": "<p>This week on HOW DID WE GET WEIRD? Jonah and Vanessa are joined by musician and longtime friend of the Bayers, Chris Farren. We discuss our favorite iteration of the Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles as well as Chris's childhood toy preferences. We also get into Chris's amazing ability to create viral merch and Vanessa chimes in with her own expert opinion of how to price band merchandise. Finally, we debut a new segment called CEO TAKEDOWN where we critique the all-CEO band The Moderators who you probably read about on about <a href=\"http://cheifexecutive.net/\">cheifexecutive.net</a> aka Pitchfork for CEOs. You don't have to be a multi-billionaire to enjoy this episode of the podcast. In fact, it's probably better if you aren't one.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
