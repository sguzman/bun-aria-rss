  "description": "<p>On this episode of the Bear Grease Podcast we’re talking about two giant, public-land whitetails killed by the same man on the same year, all the while exploring a universal and ancient idea. It’s one that has not escaped any culture - it’s homogenous across time, oceans, and peoples. It’s the idea of a “streak of luck”. All can agree that beneficial things do happen that are far beyond human control, but the catalyst or origin of this favor are where the ideologies diverge. I want to introduce you, posthumously, to an incredible man by the name of Ora Lee Provence, who Clay Newcomb interviewed in 2019, just one month prior to his passing at the age of 91 – Mr. Oree, as he was called, killed two non-typical deer in the fall of 1965 on public land in the Ozark Mountains of Arkansas. This was as unlikely as being struck by lightning -  twice. We’ll hear from Mr. Oree himself and meet his son, we’ll also hear from Whitetail wackos Mark Kenyon and Tony Peterson from MeatEater’s Wired To Hunt Podcast, and we’ll talk with one of the best Ozark Mountain deer hunters I know, Moe Shepherd, about streaks of luck. </p>\n<p>Connect with <a href=\"https://www.themeateater.com/authors/claynewcomb\">Clay</a> and <a href=\"https://www.themeateater.com/\">MeatEater</a></p>\n<p>Clay on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/clay_newcomb\">Instagram</a></p>\n<p>MeatEater on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/meateater\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/StevenRinellaMeatEater/\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MeatEaterTV?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Twitter</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAaa0mleeU128Ad5iM1RFIg\">Youtube</a></p>\n<p>Shop <a href=\"https://store.themeateater.com/collections/bear-grease-podcast\">Bear Grease Merch</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
