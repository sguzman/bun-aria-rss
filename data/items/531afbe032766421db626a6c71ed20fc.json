But that dark thing was always hanging over his head, especially since his excuse was self serving, at best, a complete insult to everybody's intelligence, at worst. And it's not the end, as his other accused crime may even be scarier than the first, this time involving kidnapping & gunplay! The end of the episode will be quite the surprise, as well!!
