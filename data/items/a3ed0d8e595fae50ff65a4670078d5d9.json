  "description": "We are going to be talking about the Spring market trend forecast. We feel that everybody is ready for rejuvenation, to understand what’s new or trending, and where we are going with designs and styles. We tend to stay away from things that are highly trendy, so the things we suggest in this episode will only be somewhat trendy. We talk about switching from an OG edge to a straight edge, and then the importance of fluting and reeding on your tables, chairs, or banisters. We recommend high styling, or using high quality products instead of a larger quantity of less expensive, or valuable items to keep your space a little more minimalistic and less cluttered. <br /><br />Take your own taste into consideration 2:36<br />From OG edge to a straight edge 6:30<br />Fluting and reeding 8:39<br />Color blocking 12:00<br />High styling accessories 15:54<br />Entertainment spaces 18:54<br />Luxe minimalism 19:57<br />Martyn Lawrence Bullard on trends for 2021 27:22<br /><br />“It’s so busy, and that’s everywhere in the market. Everyone is slammed on home projects and house building and remodels because that staying in is so, so true, and we all realized how important our homes were. Not to us, but to our families, to our kids. That environment is so critical to our happiness and how we live.” 19:19<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
