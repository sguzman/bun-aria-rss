  "title": "Top QB/Coach Duos in the NFL: Patrick Mahomes/Andy Reid clear No. 1, but who comes next? (Football 8/13)",
  "description": "Generally speaking, if you want a good football team you have to have a solid quarterback and head coach. If you want to have a great football team, you'll likely need better than good at those two positions. On this episode, Will Brinson, Ryan Wilson and John Breech rank the top QB/coach duos in the NFL. But first, they address Sean McDermott's contract extension from the Bills (6:15) and where he fits in on the list of best coaches never to win a Super Bowl. Then, Ryan offers a quick Hard Knocks recap (18:00). If you could combine any QB and coach, regardless of current team, who are you picking (32:30)? The guys answer that before diving into a draft of the top actual QB/coach combos from around the league (47:00). Patrick Mahomes and Andy Reid are a match made in football heaven and the obvious top choice, but after that, it's fair game.\n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nFollow the Pick Six team on Twitter: @picksixpod, @willbrinson, @ryanwilsonCBS, @johnbreech\nVisit the Pick Six YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/picksix\nCheck out the Pick Six Instagram page https://www.instagram.com/picksixpod/?hl=en\nJoin our Facebook group https://www.facebook.com/groups/758548147935545/\nFor more NFL coverage from CBS Sports, visit https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/\nTo hear more from the CBS Sports Podcast Network, visit https://www.cbssports.com/podcasts/\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
