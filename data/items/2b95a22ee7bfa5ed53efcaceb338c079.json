  "description": "On the court, there are players who bring it... and then there are players who BRING it. Pat Beverley is one of those players. Backed by his tenacious defense - and an equally tenacious personality - Beverley is widely recognized as a premier defender in the NBA. But that aggressive approach isn't just limited to the court. In this spectacular in-your-face interview, you will quickly realize that when Pat Beverley wants to say something, he's going to say it - damn the consequences. The reason he can do this? Well, that's easy...the man can back it up. Join JJ and Tommy as they head straight into the storm with \"Mr. 94 Feet\". Trust us when we say, you won't be disappointed.\nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\nLearn more about your ad choices.
