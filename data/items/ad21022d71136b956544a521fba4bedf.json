  "title": "Sadly Dead Baes: Patrick Swayze",
  "description": "If you watched Dirty Dancing and it didn’t change your life in some way, R.I.P. because you are clearly dead and we need to send flowers to your family. Patrick Swayze epitomized a certain type of  graceful masculinity, a Marlboro man who can dance en pointe. From The Outsiders to Roadhouse to Ghost and beyond, we watched Patrick Swayze change our ideas of what masculinity could be. Plus he was so handsome to watch: those slim hips, the wide shoulders. You can rescue us from any corner, Patrick. Fanfic Wars will take you there and we take you out on some fan mail. Get ready. \nDo you need help figuring out your next crush? Drop us a line! Leave us a message at (765) 8-THIRST (765-884-4778) with your name and what kind of crush advice you're looking for, and maybe we'll answer your question in an upcoming Thirst Sommelier. \nFollow us on Twitter @ThirstAidKit.
