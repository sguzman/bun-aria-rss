  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat is joined by a slew of great guests. First, the only man to be a 4x World Heavyweight Champion, bronze medalist at the 1984 Olympic Games, one of the greatest boxers of all-time, Evander \"The Real Deal\" Holyfield joins the show. Pat and Evander talk about him coming out of retirement for an exhibition fight for his charity Unite4OurFight.org, and what all of that entails. They also discuss who some potential opponents could be, whether or not him and Mike Tyson decided to come back at the same time, and Evander walks us through Mike Tyson biting his ear off, and everything that went into that (1:02-19:08). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk where Pat and AJ welcome in ESPN MLB Insider, Jeff Passan to discuss whether or not there is going to be an MLB season this year, what Jeff is hearing from the players and why they're pissed at the MLB's proposal, how much power super agent Scott Boras wields in negotiations, and gives a peek behind the curtain when he explains his ESPN backdrop (47:05-1:11:45). Pat and AJ chat about the repercussions of no MLB season, whether or not they buy the report that Jadeveon Clowney turned down a lucrative offer from the Browns, and everything else happening around the world of sports (21:22-1:49:03). To close out the show, Super Bowl Champion with the Green Bay Packers, 2012's receiving TD's leader in the NFL, and friend of the program, James Jones joins the show. Pat and James chat about why he thinks Aaron Rodgers is going to win the MVP this year, his thoughts on the Packers' draft, why he thinks Mike McCarthy is going to be successful in Dallas, his thoughts on the Dak Prescott situation, and why Derek Carr is a special QB that doesn't get the recognition that he deserves (1:52:12-2:03:20). Don't forget to send in the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat with a picture of where you're listening to the show for the chance to win some free merch. Have the greatest weekend of all-time. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
