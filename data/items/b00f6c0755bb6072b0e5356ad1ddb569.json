  "description": "On Monday’s Mark Levin show, The appointment of Robert Mueller violates the Appointments Clause of the Constitution because he was never confirmed by the Senate and every subpoena, indictment, and plea agreement should be null and void. Mueller is not an inferior appointee, but a principal appointee as understood under our constitutional. Mueller would've had to be nominated for Senate confirmation like any other principal officer in the Executive Branch. Every defendant, suspect and witness, in this matter should challenge the Mueller appointment with this violation. Ater Mark's appearance on Fox News recommending that President Trump's legal team investigate the tactics of the Mueller probe. This weekend Trump requested that the Inspector General look into irregularities in the FBI's investigation to his then-campaign. Then, James Clapper should be dragged in front of a federal grand jury to know what this man did! And so should James Comey, John Brennan Susan Rice, and Samantha Power for the same reason! Finally, Texas Candidate Chip Roy calls in to make a final point about his primary runoff campaign for district 21.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
