  "description": "<p>Wisdom Q+R<br />\n Welcome to our Q+R on the Wisdom Literature in the Bible!<br />\n In this episode, Tim and Jon respond to seven questions. You can read those questions with their timestamps below.</p>\n<p>Toonna from Canada (1:55): Hi, Tim and Jon. My name is Toonna and I am calling from Canada. I'm Nigerian, but I currently live in Canada. I just got done listening to the podcast of the tree of knowing good and bad. Towards the end of the podcast, I was really interested in the conversation around the fear of the Lord and wisdom, how Adam and Eve were afraid of God after they ate of the fruit of the tree of good and bad but not afraid before, enough to not eat of the fruit. So I was curious if you have any thoughts on how we as Christians today can be possessed or consumed by the fear of the Lord enough to not commit sin today. Thank you very much.</p>\n<p>Jan from Texas (21:10): I was especially interested in your commentary on the role of the woman as the 'ezer, implying that she's someone provided for the adam to address the \"not good\" situation of his being alone and which then allows him to fulfill his mission \"as designed\" (so to speak). I'm curious, though, about how to reconcile this with Paul's statements in 1 Corinthians 7 regarding his wish that church members would remain unmarried (as he is). Typically, I've been taught that Paul was better able to fulfill his mission because of his single status, which seems a little at odds with the ideas discussed in these recent podcasts. So my question is: What's the best/most accurate way to handle Paul's teachings, especially viewed through the lens of the wisdom literature in particular? I feel like there's probably something my 21st-century Western mind is missing.</p>\n<p>Wesley from California (45:45): Hi, Tim and Jon, this is Wesley from Chowchilla, California. In your video on the Books of Solomon, you mentioned that Ecclesiastes is like Solomon as an old man reflecting on his life. In 1 Kings 11, Solomon dies apostate as king. I've been reading Tremper Longman's New International Commentary on Ecclesiastes, and in it he argues that Solomon did not write Ecclesiastes but that Collette is taking on Solomon's persona to make his point. And he seems to abandon this persona after three chapters. Can I get your thoughts on this idea? Also, I just want to say that I love The Bible Project. Thank you for everything you guys do.</p>\n<p>Taylor from Tennessee (49:23): Hey guys, this is Taylor from Knoxville, Tennessee. I'm trying to gain a better understanding of wisdom, and it appears that the opposite of wisdom is doing what is right in your own eyes. It seems that that's the underlying theme of the book of Judges, and I was curious to see if there was any correlation or relationship that the authors try to make there with wisdom.</p>\n<p>Brad from Wisconsin (53:10): My question came up about midway through the series, and it has to do with David. Does he play any role in the Wisdom Literature of the Bible, or is the major theme of wisdom attributed to Solomon exclusively? I see Solomon's portrayal of wisdom to be a piece of what it means to be an image bearer. Does King David share a similar motif?</p>\n<p>Micah from Oregon (56:35): Hi, my name is Micah Sharp. I'm from Newberg, Oregon. Here's my question. If we're switching from the wisdom literature to the classification of the books of Solomon, where does the book of Job now fit in the wider Hebrew Bible? Thank you.</p>\n<p>Kayleigh from South Africa (1:02:47): My question is about the Song of Songs. I was wondering if there's a connection between the two lovers in the Song of Songs who never get to fully consummate their love for each other and the New Jerusalem as a bride of the Lamb in Revelation? Could this be, in a sense, when the two lovers get to completely unite with each other in Revelation? I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.</p>\n<p>Thank you to all our supporters!</p>\n<p>Find out more at www.thebibleproject.com</p>\n<p>Show Resources:<br />\nOur video on How to Read the Books of Solomon: https://youtu.be/WJgt1vRkPbI<br />\nAn Obituary for Wisdom Literature by Will Kynes</p>\n<p>Show Music: Defender Instrumental by Tents</p>\n<p>Show Produced by: Dan Gummel</p>\n<p>Powered and distributed by Simplecast.</p>\n",
