  "description": "<p>It’s a potluck podcast!  Christians predict the world will end… last Saturday?  Plus, the story of two committed Christians in the NFL, both philanthropically active, both known for taking a knee on the field.  Yet one is a hero and the other a villain.  We’re talking about Tim Tebow and Colin Kaepernick, and it’s a fascinating study of what the American Church values today.  Oh yeah… and the Swiss’s toilets are full of money.  No really.  Money.  This week on the podcast!</p>",
