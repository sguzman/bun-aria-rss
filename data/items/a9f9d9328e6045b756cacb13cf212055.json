  "description": "<p>We have covered many former and abandoned sanatoriums and mental institutions on this podcast. It never ceases to amaze us how many of these buildings still stand. And all of them seem to have stories of haunting activity. The Molly Stark Sanatorium in Ohio is in really poor condition and thus, no one is allowed inside the buildings and a protective fence has been erected, complete with barbed wire at the top. Despite this fact, many people have been inside and claim to have had experiences. The Sanatorium became a hospital later caring for generally ill people, mentally ill people, addictions, the developmentally disabled and the elderly. Join us as we explore the history and haunts of the Molly Stark Sanatorium! The Moment in Oddity was suggested by Jannae McCabe and features the Scaly-Foot Snail and This Month in History features Yuri Gagarin as first man in space. Our location was suggested by Anthony Wallace and Jennifer Svoboda.</p> <p>Our sponsor for this episode is Wooga's June's Journey: The Lost Diaries Podcast.
