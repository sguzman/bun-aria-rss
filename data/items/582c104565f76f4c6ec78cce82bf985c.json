  "description": "<p>This twenty-first episode of the Philosophy Bakes Bread radio show and podcast is a special edition of the show that we call a \"breadcrumb.\" A Breadcrumb is a short, 8-20 minute episode that was cut off from a longer show, that's a collage of little clips, or, as in this case, that is a response to listener feedback. Today's breadcrumb episode is a bigger version of what in the past we called a \"You Tell Me!\" segment.</p> <p>In this second breadcrumb, Dr. Eric Thomas Weber and Dr. Anthony Cashio invited <a href= \"https://www.gvsu.edu/liberalstudies/danielle-lake-24.htm\" target= \"_blank\">Dr. Danielle Lake</a> back on the show. Danielle was first interviewed in Episode 12 of the show, which we called \"<a href= \"https://www.philosophersinamerica.com/2017/03/31/016-ep12-thats-a-wicked-problem-youve-got-there/\" target=\"_blank\">That's a Wicked Problem You've Got There</a>.\" Recall that Dr. Lake is assistant professor in the department of Liberal Studies at Grand Valley State University, with her Ph.D. in Philosophy. In 2016, she was honored with the John Lachs Award for Public Philosophy from the Society for the Advancement of American Philosophy.
