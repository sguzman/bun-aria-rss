Kenya counted up their ballots and declared a new president, while China skipped the ballots and declared Jinping the new guy in charge.  Dennis Rodman went to North Korea and made many Americans angry (or frustrated as they couldn't understand a word he says).  PRX launches a new media storage system for the internets.
