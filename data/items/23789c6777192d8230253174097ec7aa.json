  "description": "Kara and Scott talk about how Twitter duped us all again. Scott is fresh off a conference where both he and Sheryl Sandberg talked about the future of Facebook (spoiler alert: they have very different takes on how the company should move forward). Kara gets caught up in the Covington Catholic video drama. Now she's going head-to-head with Tucker Carlson (hey Tucker, want to come on our podcast?). Meanwhile, in another Twitter feud this week, Cardi B is a big winner after saying she'd \"dog walk\" Tomi Lahren. Also, Fyre Fest is still the biggest fail of all time (but the new documentaries about it are both a win!). And, Kara's prediction is that she'll never own another car again.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
