The upshot is that some retirees have resources not reflected in the statistics and that others lacking resources are being quite rational about it. I conclude with the story of a Chilean waterside enclave to underscore the key point I believe this survey brings out.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices</p>",
