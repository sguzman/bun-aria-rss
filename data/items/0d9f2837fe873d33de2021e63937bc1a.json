  "description": "Google had its Google Event yesterday and Marques and David were there in person to check everything out. As soon as they got back they sat down with Andrew to talk about the event as a whole and first impressions on everything that was announced (right after talking about the fact that Marques can edit tweets). Then they discuss the Pixel 7 and Pixel 7 Pro, the new Pixel Watch, and the Pixel Tablet which Andrew and David are super hyped about. Finally, we round it all up with some Google trivia.
