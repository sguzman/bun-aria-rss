It's what he calls the \"Alter Ego Effect,\" and it's all about tapping the power of secret-identifies, creating and stepping into them to change not only the way your brains works, but also the way your body performs in an instant.</p><p>Todd shares the entire Alter Ego methodology, along with the science behind it and a wide-array of case-studies in his new book, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2RECL1n\" target=\"_blank\">The Alter Ego Effect</a> (https://amzn.to/2RECL1n).
