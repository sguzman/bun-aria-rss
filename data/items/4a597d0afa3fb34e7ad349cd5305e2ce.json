  "description": "Buddhists don’t tend to shy away from talking about body parts -- but usually it’s more along the lines of meditating on things like spittle, defecation (otherwise known as poop) and the inevitable decay of the body. So where do sex and sexuality fit into this mix? Bottom line: how can we use sex to wake up? In this episode, I talk with dharma practitioners Devon and Craig Hase. They’re not sexperts by any stretch, but as a married couple who recently emerged from a year of monastic vows (which included celibacy), they’ve spent a lot of time exploring the intersection of mindfulness, meditation and sex. In fact, their new book How Not to Be a Hot Mess includes a whole chapter called, “Make Sex Good.” We start with a fascinating discussion about their own experimentation with esoteric, Tantric sex practices, but then veer directly into garden variety sex issues. It’s a fascinating chat, and I appreciate Devon and Craig being so open and honest on an intensely personal issue.\nWhere to find Devon & Craig Hase online: \nWebsite: http://devonandcraighase.com/\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/devonandcraighase\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/devonandcraig/\nBook: How Not to Be a Hot Mess by Craig & Devon Hase: https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781611807981\nThere's still time to join and complete the Summer Sanity Challenge: a free 21 day meditation challenge.
