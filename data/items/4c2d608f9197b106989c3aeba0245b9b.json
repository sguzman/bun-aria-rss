  "description": "On Friday’s Mark Levin Show, Nancy Pelosi has been very selective with her outrage over racism and desire to remove statues. Pelosi has been in Congress since 1981 and has never once even tried to remove any statues. In fact, Pelosi sang the praises of the late Senator Robert Byrd, a former leader of the Ku Klux Klan, that Pelosi and then-Vice President Joe Biden, lauded Byrd as the embodiment of the American Dream. Even President Obama failed to acknowledge Byrd's long history as a Klansman. Later, Black Lives Matter co-founder, Patrisse Cullors, openly admits to being a \"trained Marxist\" yet the media remains silent on the violence born from the movement she helped start. Not a single word from the media on the antisemitism coming from this movement. Afterward, Vice President Mike Pence joins the show to discuss the reopening of America and shared his thoughts on the Supreme Court's recent decision on DACA. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
