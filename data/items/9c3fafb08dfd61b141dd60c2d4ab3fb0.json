  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the governor of New York is set to fire hundreds of health care workers for not getting vaccinated, artificially creating a healthcare worker shortage. While speaking at a church, she framed her vaccine mandates in explicitly religious terms. It’s blasphemous but revealing. Also, Joe Biden gets his third COVID shot while announcing that things won’t get back to normal until 98 percent of all people are jabbed. Plus, a medical journal refers to women as “bodies with vaginas.” And more information has come out about that guy who whipped up a social media mob against a woman who allegedly said something mean about him at the dog park. Finally, the local media here in my home of Virginia are not happy that I’ve come to speak at the Loudoun County school board. We’ll play a few clips for you today. \nYou petitioned, and we heard you.
