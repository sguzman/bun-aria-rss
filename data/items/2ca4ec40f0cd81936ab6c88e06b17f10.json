  "description": "<p>Welcome back to Access & Opportunity, a podcast from Morgan Stanley dedicated to connecting capital and communities. I’m Carla Harris. In just a few weeks, we’ll be back for Season 4 and we’re excited to continue exploring the extraordinary commercial opportunity investors often overlook - investing in women and multiculturally-led businesses.&nbsp;</p><p>In our upcoming season we’ll be speaking with entrepreneurs who successfully scaled and sold their companies. We’ll focus not only on how they got there, but how they got out - and what they wish they had known beforehand.</p><p>And for this season, we’re asking for your help. As we speak to these entrepreneurs who have all sold their companies to large corporations, we’ll be asking them listener-submitted questions. So, if you’re interested in how these prosperous founders built their networks, how they managed to secure that initial investor, or how they navigated their way to success, please leave us a voicemail at 3 - 3 - 0 - 8 - ACCESS (222377). That’s 3-3-0-8-2-2-2-3-7-7. Alternatively, feel free to write us an email with your question at carlapod@morganstanley.com. If you’re lucky, you might just hear your question in an episode of the upcoming fourth season of Access & Opportunity!</p><p><em>The guest speakers are neither employees nor affiliated with Morgan Stanley & Co.
