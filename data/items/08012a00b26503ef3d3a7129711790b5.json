  "description": "<p>Do you ever have trouble gaining the right perspective in your business, your leadership, or your life? When you possess an accurate perspective, you can more easily identify key problems and, more importantly, identify key solutions in your leadership. But perspective isn’t gained alone. You need people on your team who think, look, and act differently than you do. You need <em>diversity</em> on your team.</p> <p>This week on the Maxwell Leadership Podcast, we begin a new series on building a diverse team. That’s because diversity is an asset to any leader that wants to create powerful, positive change in their organization or community. In part one of this series, John Maxwell shares the barriers that often get in the way of building diverse teams. During the application portion of the episode, Mark Cole and Chris Goede discuss John’s lesson and how the fear of conflict can get in the way of building diverse teams. If you want to build and unleash an all-star team in your organization, you do not want to miss this series.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this series is the “Building a Diverse Team Worksheet,” which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching. You can download the worksheet by visiting MaxwellPodcast.com/Diverse and clicking “Download the Bonus Resource.”</p> <p>References:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1pIlnfT5ta4\">Watch this episode on YouTube!</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://store.johnmaxwell.com/Leader-Shift--11-Essential-Changes-Every-Leader-Must-Embrace--Hardcover_p_2817.html\"> <em>Leadershift</em> by John C.
