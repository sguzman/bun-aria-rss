And successive revisions of the language and the standard library add features which help the user prevent problems. But inevitably, upsets happen during program operation.\n \nThis talk discusses what program developers can do to help. Contracts and their implications are the main tool used to frame run-time failure. Through their lens I attempt to show that careful understanding of interfaces is the most effective way to ensure usability, efficiency and reliability.\n--- \n\nJohn McFarlane \n\nI write automotive software in Co Clare, Ireland and frequent WG21 committee meetings, mostly concentrating on numerics and safety-critical software development. I currently have a CS:CO problem. \n---\n\nC++ on Sea is an annual C++ and coding conference, in Folkestone, in the UK. The 2022 conference was conducted as a two part, physical and online C++ event. \n- Annual C++ on Sea,  C++ conference: https://cpponsea.uk/\n- 2022 Program: https://cpponsea.uk/2022/schedule/\n---\n\nProduced and Edited by Digital Medium Ltd: https://events.digital-medium.co.uk\nEnquiries: events@digital-medium.co.uk\n\n#Programming​ #Cpp​ #CppOnSea​",
