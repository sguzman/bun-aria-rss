  "description": "<p>A special treat for you today in the lead up to the Beijing Olympics as we not only speak to our first ever biathlete, we also speak to our first ever New Zealand Olympian as we chat with New Zealand’s only ever Olympic biathlete, Sarah Snowsell. Sarah talks us through just how an injury in a completely unrelated sport helped her take up biathlon, and just how this journey ended up leading her to compete for New Zealand at the Olympics. She also goes over the unique training needed for the sport of biathlon, just how intense the rivalry is between the biathletes, cross-country skiers and alpine skiers as well as just why she is basically James Bond in real life. It’s a great and fun interview that you will enjoy so get to listening! </p>",
