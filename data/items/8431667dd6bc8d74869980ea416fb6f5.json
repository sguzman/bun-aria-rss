  "description": "I AM NASCAR | SEASON 2: EPISODE 14\n\nBrandon Marshall, Channing Crowder and Dion \"Rocko\" Williams sit down with American professional stock car driver and the 2021 NASCAR Xfinity Series Champion Daniel Hemric in Episode 14 of I Am Nascar. Daniel walks the crew through his career path that birthed from the struggles of seeing his family barley make ends meet and put food on the table for him. \n\nDaniel, Brandon and Channing begin this episode with sharing key defining moments in their career that help them propel their careers to another level. Daniel shares his defining moment of competing in over 150 races total while racing 3-4 times in one week all while working on his own car. Channing jumps in and shares that his defining moment was when an orthopedic doctor told him he shouldn't play football anymore after a knee injury. He used that moment to stand his ground and refuse the doctors diagnosis and seek a second opinion.  \n\nDaniel Shares a story of how he won $250,000 in his first major race and how he had no gas in his 95 Honda Civic to return home after the race and how he had to suck gas from his race car and out into his Honda civic just to return home. \n\nBrandon pushes the conversation forward to how Daniel became the 2021 Xfinity Series title champion. Daniel tells a detail story to how he used a last lap, overtime pass of Cindric at the season finale at Phoenix Raceway to not only win the first race of his NASCAR career, but also the 2021 Xfinity Series title. Daniel goes on to explain how that one race defined his entire life. \n\nWrapping things up Daniel recaps his journey and encourages others to never give up and continuing to fight.\n\n\nI AM ATHLETE:\nOfficial Site: https://iamathletetv.com/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/iamathlete\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/iamathletep...\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/IAMATHLETEpod\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@iamathlete_po...\n\nHOUSE OF ATHLETE:\nOfficial Site: https://houseofathlete.com/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/thehouseofa...\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/houseofathlete\nApparel Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/houseofathl...\nHoA Supplements on Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/houseofathlete\n\n#IAANascar\n#IAMATHLETE\n#BrandonMarshall\n#ChanningCrowder\n#DanielHemric\n#MoreThanAPodcast",
