  "description": "<p>We know that many people have a tendency to blame victims even when something tragic and unexplainable happens to them.  But did you know how easily this blaming can be triggered?  If I were to describe a natural disaster and tell you about \"mother nature's wrath\" would you be more or less willing to help the victims?  I'll also talk about two common occurrences in adolescence: the imaginary audience and the personal fable.  Find out them in this episode of The Psych Files. </p>",
