  "description": "<p>This episode didn't need a topic, it just needed Duncan Trussell. Professional mind-blower and joke teller, Duncan and I discuss everything. Is God a loving, benevolent force or an evil deceiver? Does evil even exist? Are there boundaries between people or are we essentially the same being? Do we have a soul? What about a self and a Self? Who the hell is Neem Karoli Baba and is how is he related to Adam Corrolla? Strap yourself into your spaceship, because we are about to blast off into the outer limits of space and time! </p>\n",
