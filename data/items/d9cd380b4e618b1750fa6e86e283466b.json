  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">For ten years, Scott Harrison was one of the most successful club promoters in NYC. His life was marked by every hedonistic indulgence imaginable. Today, he’s the founder and CEO of Charity:Water, a non-profit that has brought clean water to over 10 million people around the world. Scott shares the remarkable story of his transformation and faith with Skye in an interview you won’t want to miss. Also this week, the head of a Catholic school bans Harry Potter books because he fears the spells they contain are real. New data says Millennials are abandoning God, country, and family.
