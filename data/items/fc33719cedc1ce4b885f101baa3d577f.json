  "description": "On Tuesday’s Mark Levin show, Rep Adam Schiff is obstructing Congress and hiding the so-called whistleblower to protect himself. The bureaucrats in the CIA, National Security Council, and other areas of our government are used to getting their way. They work with the Democrats in Washington. They worked to supplant the President's appointments by slow-walking requests for security clearances for President Trump's appointees so that former President Obama's hold-overs could remain on the NSC. The real story here is how Schiff prevents Republicans from asking questions in the impeachment hearings that would expose who leaked the classified information claiming that it's actually to protect the so-called whistleblower (whom nobody seems to know). Then, Reps. Devin Nunes and Jim Jordan established from today's witnesses that there was no bribery or impeachable offense. Later, Speaker Pelosi should testify as to what she knew and when regarding the bribery extortion, and quid pro, quo of Joe and Hunter Biden. The Biden’s should be interviewed as part of these hearings. Americans deserve to know. Afterward, Tim Morrison's testimony was of particular importance since he is a witness that was on the call between Trump and Zelensky and refuted what was claimed by the unknown so-called whistleblower.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
