In her new book, <a href=\"https://www.basicbooks.com/titles/eugenia-cheng/x-y/9781541646513/\"><em>x+y</em></a>, she challenges readers to think beyond their ingrained conceptions of gender. Instead, she calls for a new dimension of thinking, characterizing behavior in a way completely removed from considerations of gender. <br/><br/>Cheng argues that at every level — from the interpersonal to the societal — we would benefit from focusing less on gender and more on equitable, inclusive interactions, regardless of a person's gender identity.   <br/><br/>You can reach the show by emailing <a href=\"mailto:shortwave@npr.org\">shortwave@npr.org</a>.
