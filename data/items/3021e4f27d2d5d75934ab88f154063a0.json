  "description": "My special guest is author Michael Brien here to discuss his new book containing years of collected experiences from people who seem to have repeated experiences with the paranormal and other strange phenomena. Get his book The Road to Strange: The Contiguous Universe on Amazon.\n\nThey say UFOs are real.\nHumanity's biggest mystery, the alien presence on Earth, continues!\nFor thousands of years, to the present \"modern era,\" people have been obsessed with the idea that we've been visited by intelligent beings from elsewhere - whether extraterrestrials, inter-dimensionals, or maybe even denizens from our future.\nThe US Pentagon admits not only are we not alone, but that we need to revive our study and understanding of what is really going on in our skies.\nUFOs, aliens, and the paranormal have received renewed coverage in the media. No longer do we need fear the ridicule of the past; these subjects are not only worthy of continued study, they demand it!\nIn this audiobook, we examine UFOs and the paranormal, with an expanded look at the lives of people who not only have had at least one major UFO or paranormal experience, but who have even had a lifetime of such experiences. We examine in depth what more we can learn from people who have had multiple, repeat experiences of the strange and the unknown.\n\nWanna get creeped out?
