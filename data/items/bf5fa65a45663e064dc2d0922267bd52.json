  "description": "Besides Tamagotchi, grunge, and Friends, what were the 90s actually good for? Glad you asked: superior Thirst Objects! We're taking a look back at the decade that helped advance our thirst development and shaped the core tenets of our thirst as we live it now. We start off with Morris Chestnut — V-shaped and lovely — before moving on to sexy spark plug of lust, Larenz Tate, and then rounding things out with triple threat Antonio Banderas. We also help a listener find a \"thick zaddy\" in Thirst Sommelier, and as for Fanfic Wars? Well. Stay hydrated.\nDo you need help figuring out your next crush? Drop us a line! Leave us a message at (765) 8-THIRST (765-884-4778) with your name and what kind of crush advice you're looking for, and maybe we'll answer your question in an upcoming Thirst Sommelier. \nFollow us on Twitter @ThirstAidKit. Bim is @bimadew and Nichole is @tnwhiskeywoman. Find show notes, fanfic, and more on our Tumblr. Share your drabbles with us there or email them to us at thirstaidkit@slate.com.
