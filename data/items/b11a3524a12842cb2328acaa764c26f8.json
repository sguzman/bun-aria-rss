  "description": "<p>As we approach \"back to school\" in the UK and Louise's course comes to end, we are both thinking about transitioning back to studio work. But the &nbsp;Covid-19 pandemic has taken its toll and in this episode, we discuss how that has manifested for each of us. From a general feeling of being scattered (Alice) to a fear of public transport (Louise) and the over-riding sense that very little is certain anymore. But since uncertainty is our new reality, how do we stay upbeat and motivated? Our wide-ranging discussion spans meditation, managing moods, enjoying the present moment, insomnia, self-knowledge, the joys of a Sunday newspaper, and how we can make more time for things we enjoy. We also discuss what keeps us from doing what we want, including the fear of becoming totally selfish, the habit of staying busy, and the danger of failing in public. In the end, we both believe that this strange lockdown time has made us re-evaluate our priorities and tune in to what we really want out of our lives.</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned:</strong></p>\n<p>See Alice's latest work at <strong>The Cowshed Collective: </strong><br>\n<a href=\"https://www.artwavefestival.org/2020venues/cowshed-collective\">https://www.artwavefestival.org/2020venues/cowshed-collective</a></p>\n<p><strong>Alastair Campbell “Living Better”:<br>\n</strong><a href=\"https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/aug/30/alastair-campbell-surviving-depression-how-i-learned-to-live-with-my-enemy\"><u><strong>https://www.theguardian.com/global/2020/aug/30/alastair-campbell-surviving-depression-how-i-learned-to-live-with-my-enemy</strong></u></a></p>\n<p><strong>Annie Nightingale: “Hey, Hi, Hello” 5 decades of popular culture<br>\n</strong><a href=\"https://www.waterstones.com/book/hey-hi-hello/annie-nightingale//9781474616683\"><u><strong>https://www.waterstones.com/book/hey-hi-hello/annie-nightingale//9781474616683</strong></u></a></p>\n<p>Find us and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</a></p>\n<p>Support the podcast with a small donation at: <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://ko-fi.com/artjuice</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p>Alice <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com@alicesheridanstudio/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p>Louise <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n<p><br></p>\n",
