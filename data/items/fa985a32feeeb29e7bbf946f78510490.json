  "description": "This week on the Colin and Samir Podcast we’ve got a bit of a different episode for you guys, we asked you on instagram what you wanted to see in the storytelling course that we’re working on and a lot of you asked about the brainstorming process. So we had a brainstorm planned for the week and thought we’d just press record and bring you a long. Storytelling isn’t just about the specific videos we make but also about a brand as a whole, a great brand is a great story - and we feel like we could e telling a better story as a brand. So in this brainstorm we work through our show the breakdown and try and come up with a Unique Value Prop for the show as well as the branding elements and framework that will communicate the unique value prop to the audience.",
