  "description": "<p>The premelting of ice is well known, but not about how the premelted and\nsolid surfaces convert into each other. In this work, the transition dynamics\nbetween two phases are revealed with large-scale molecular dynamics\nsimulations. Supercooling and superheating states exist in the transition, and\nare overcome by nucleation-like processes. The natural inhomogeneity of ice\nsurface enhances nuclei formation, while it only accelerates premelting but not\nfreezing. Furthermore, the complete freezing of ice surfaces may be hindered by\nthe stacking order mismatch between nuclei. This work points out the importance\nof metastable states in premelting studies, and calls attention to their\npotential effects on related physics.\n</p>",
