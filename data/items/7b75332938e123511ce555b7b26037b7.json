  "description": "Why is the artist’s voice missing from cultural policy? In Artists’ Voices in Cultural Policy: Careers, Myths and the Creative Profession after German Unification (Palgrave Macmillan, 2018), Dr. Simone Wesner, a lecturer in arts management at Birkbeck, University of London, explores this question in the context of post-war and post-unification Germany. The book offers a wealth of detail on the German context, comparing two cultural policy regimes across Saxony, through a longitudinal study of a cohort of artists. Published as part of Palgrave’s New Directions In Cultural Policy Research series, the book offers new theoretical insights to cultural policy, particularly working with the idea of memory to help understand artistic careers as well as national and regional cultural policy. A fascinating read, the book will be of interest across media and cultural studies, as well as for historians, along with anyone interested in understanding the artist’s career and the artists’ role in society.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
