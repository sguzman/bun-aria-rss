  "title": "The Carbon Copy: Get ready for the battery recycling boom",
  "description": "On the Carbon Copy podcast this week:\nIt’s been over three months since Russia’s invasion of Ukraine sent shockwaves into global oil markets, causing supply constraints and skyrocketing prices. The conflict has complicated the flow of energy at a time when supply chains were already jumbled up because of Covid.\nBut it’s not just oil. The war is leaving its mark on all kinds of commodities, including the global supplies of minerals and metals. Geopolitical shifts are causing big spikes in the prices of lithium and nickel, two key components of the lithium-ion batteries used in electric cars.\nHowever, this supply mess could actually be boosting a positive trend in the battery space: recycling. \nBatteries are a pillar of the zero-carbon economy, but are they truly sustainable? And will technical advancements and evolving geopolitical alliances alter the battery-based economy for the better?\nOur guest is Julian Spector, a senior reporter with Canary Media. Check out his latest report on five exciting startups tackling battery recycling from different angles. And check out all of Canary’s Recycling Renewables special coverage.\nThe Carbon Copy is a co-production of Post Script Media and Canary Media.\nCatalyst is supported by Antenna Group.
