  "description": "Since we last talked to Nick Friedell two weeks ago, the Brooklyn Nets’ vibes have gone from great to bad…to worse. Last Thursday, Kyrie Irving tweeted a link to a film littered with antisemitic tropes and later refused to answer questions about it. In addition, the Nets have lost 5 of their last 6 games and are in last place in the Atlantic Division. On Tuesday, head coach Steve Nash and the team parted ways, and now the Nets are reportedly looking to hire Celtics coach Ime Udoka, who just six weeks ago was suspended by Boston for the entire season for engaging in an inappropriate workplace relationship. So Nick fills us in on everything that’s happened in the last week, why things in Brooklyn seem so bleak, and where the team goes next.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
