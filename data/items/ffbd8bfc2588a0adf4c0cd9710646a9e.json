    "media:description": "Dr. Jordan B. Peterson and Piers Morgan discuss the art of interviewing, the importance of living truthfully, the pitfalls of sycophancy, and they go into depth regarding the 2016 election, and the aftermath of Donald Trump.\n \nPiers Morgan is a British journalist and television personality who started his career working as a freelance writer for the Sun. Later he would be chosen by Rupert Murdock as editor for his publication, News of the World. This appointment would make Morgan the youngest British news editor (29) in more than fifty years. He would go on to be the editor of publications such as the Daily Mirror and MailOnline before ramping into a career on television. He would introduce documentaries for the BBC, and had a channel 4 political interview show with Amanda Platell, all before his stint as a judge on America’s Got Talent. Morgan would compete on and win the 2008 season of Celebrity Apprentice, and later famously interview the show's host, Donald Trump, after he had become the 45th US President. Morgan would work on numerous talk shows and documentary series before starting his current day production, Piers Morgan Uncensored. This show, on which controversial and celebrity guests debate Morgan, would be the first launched on talkTV, and welcome back President Trump for its premiere and second episodes.\n \n______________________________________________________________________\n\nDr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://utm.io/ueSXh\n\n—Links— \n\nDr. Jordan B.
