  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, no news is good news when it comes to the elite American media machine, which is similar to state-run media pushing the propaganda of the communist Chinese government on CCTV says Habi Zhang. Then, according to the Tennessee Star, Delaware County, Pennsylvania, election records were destroyed faster than the state law requires. Multiple videos show officials flippantly getting rid of election information. This reinforces an email from Christina Iacono read by this program in November of 2020 highlighting votes that could not be counted and ballots that had chain of custody issues. These issues were ignored by the U.S Attorney of Pennsylvania and the Attorney General's Office, yet Bill Barr claimed that no such issues were raised or brought to the Department of Justice. So why didn't the DOJ conduct an investigation? Later, in a massive ruse, NYC moves allow non-citizens to vote. This will eventually open the door for non-citizens to vote in state and federal elections as well. With the democrats pushing for same-day registration and lowering the voting age to 16, Democrats will be unstoppable. Afterward, President Biden has taken 50M barrels of oil from the country's strategic petroleum reserve. The rising cost of gas is because Biden stopped drilling on federal land, stopped fracking, and closed pipelines, a problem he says is a myth. Fossil fuel is necessary to produce almost everything. Finally, former Watergate Counsel and White House fellow Geoff Shepard joins the show to discuss his new book \"The Nixon Conspiracy: Watergate and the Plot to Remove the President.\" He reveals that a cabal of anti-Nixon prosecutors and judges created the falsehood that Nixon was part of a Watergate cover-up, however, this wasn't known for 45 years. Shepard has filed charges against the attorney for their misconduct.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
