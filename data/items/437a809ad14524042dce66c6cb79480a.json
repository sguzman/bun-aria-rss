  "description": "<p>This week, we are back with part two of John Maxwell’s incredible lesson on Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. If you missed part one, please go back and listen because there is some great wisdom that you can learn as a transformational leader in that episode. And this week, there is even more! As John finishes his talk on Dr. King’s life and leadership, John shares the final three points on how leaders can create positive change in their world and their community.</p> <p>During the application portion of this episode, Mark Cole and Traci Morrow dive into a leader’s crucial ability to move others to act. They discuss how leaders have the tendency to either be task-oriented or relationship-oriented, and how a leader needs to balance and leverage both in order to create positive change within their organization and their community.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this series is the “Creating Positive Change Worksheet,” which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching. You can download the worksheet by visiting MaxwellPodcast.com/MLK and clicking “Download the Bonus Resource.”</p> <p>References:</p> <p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/6nVtSq73wMc\">Watch this episode on YouTube!</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://store.johnmaxwell.com/The-Leaders-Greatest-Return-Hardcover-_p_2938.html\"> <em>The Leader’s Greatest Return</em> by John C.
