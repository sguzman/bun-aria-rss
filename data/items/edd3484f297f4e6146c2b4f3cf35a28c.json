We get into a discussion about brute arcs, what they are and the difference in the light they produce. Roger and Biggles reminisce on their experiences together on 1984, MOUNTAINS OF THE MOON, WHITE MISCHIEF and 1917. Biggles also shares some experiences with Chivo (GRAVITY and Sven Nykvist and Richard Attenborough (CHAPLIN) and talks about how he works with DPs and the importance of trust. Of course, we talk about the big lighting rig on 1917 as well as the scenes lit only by the character’s torches (flashlights). We got into the subject of new technology in lighting and the importance of being realistic when choosing the lights to use for a project - if there are hostile conditions, far better to go with something dependable. A wide-reaching episode you won’t want to miss!</p>",
