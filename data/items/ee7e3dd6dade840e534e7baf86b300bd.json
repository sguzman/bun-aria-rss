  "description": "On today's show, Pat does a deep dive on everything that happened in this weekend's championship games. He breaks down why the Chiefs might be a buzzsaw that cannot be stopped despite the fact that they still shoot themselves in foot from time to time, and why Patrick Mahomes is so damn good. Pat also looks at the 49ers wire to wire domination of the Packers and why they are so special defensively, and why he thinks Jimmy Garappolo is more than capable of making the big plays that it will take to beat the Chiefs in Super Bowl LIV. Joining the show to break down both games and look ahead to the Super Bowl matchup is 2x Super Bowl Champion, former Defensive End/Linebacker for the Patriots, and friend of the show, Rob Ninkovich. Rob chats about his big takeaways from both conference championships, and why he thinks the Super Bowl will be a very tight matchup. He also gushes about both the Chiefs weapons, and the 49ers dominant defense and run game, and gives explains what he thinks the keys will be for both teams to win in Miami. Rob also gives his thoughts on the Darrelle Revis/Richard Sherman Twitter beef (17:52-33:57). Pat also tips his cap to both the Packers and Titans and looks ahead at what each team needs to do in the offseason in order to get back into the positions they put themselves in this year. Pat also gives his thoughts on the Conor McGregor vs. Cowboy Cerrone tilt, and why he wants to see a McGregor vs. Masvidal matchup next, plus Pat gives his take on what it means that Tom Brady was seen talking with Raiders owner Mark Davis and what that means for the other teams in the league interested in Brady. Today's show is chock full of football talk looking back at the weekend that was and looking ahead to Super Bowl LIV. Cherish it, we've only got one game left. Also stick around for your chance to win $1,000 by correctly predicting the Super Bowl Champion with the hashtag #PatIPredict. Come and laugh with us, cheers.\n",
