  "description": "<p>Marc Myrsell is a land surveyor and public aquarist in SW Washington and has apparently found his specialty in historical monster attack research. In SW Oregon over the course of 30 years, miners and hunters had numerous sightings and at times violent encounters with large, hair covered creatures in the hills, above Port Orford, resulting in the methodical killing of four men, whose murders are still unsolved. Marc will be analyzing the 1924 Ape Canyon, the Thompson Flat Monster Projects and the Butchertown Murders (1875-1905) to discuss historical document and field research techniques that are used for in-depth, detailed investigation of long standing episodes of the unexplained.</p> <p>Having spent his life researching and writing on unexplained historical events, he began in earnest with a fresh investigation of the 1924 Ape Canyon attack, culminating in the discovery of the actual cabin site in 2013, where the events took place. An incredible historical story with the latest details will be shared during this presentation, you will be glad you sat in on this one!</p>",
