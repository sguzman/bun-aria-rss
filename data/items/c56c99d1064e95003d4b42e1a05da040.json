  "description": "Clay calls the lifting of the transportation mask mandate the most influential district court ruling of the 21st century and the judge \"brave.\" Airline passengers cheer and whip off masks as TSA stops enforcing mask mandate after court ruling. Clay and Buck take calls from pilots and passengers who were in the air at the time of the announcement. One pilot thinks 95% of pilots are glad not to have to be mask police any longer; once had to turn around a plane because of it. Twitter's Blue Check Brigade freaks out about personal choice mask wearing. Propaganda Czar Psaki (who Buck nicknamed) hung out to dry by White House. Super liberal NY MTA says that it still has the authority to enforce a mask mandate. Buck calls them \"morons,\" says that it's worse than if the teachers' union were making the decision for them.<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
