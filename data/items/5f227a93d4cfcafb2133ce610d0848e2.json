We don't know what we were most excited about:  Luann complaining about Ramona, Barbara talking about reggae, Dorinda scoffing at Lu, Sonja taping towels, Tinsley driving in Manhattan, or Michael Voltaggio sitting in the fourth row of our show (!!!!).  This is truly the best show on television.  Thank you Washington DC for an amazing show. And just remember that tickets to our other shows are available at watchwhatcrappens.com.
