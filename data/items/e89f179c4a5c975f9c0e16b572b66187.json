He also discusses covering the White House administration under Trump's press scrutiny and whether POTUS owns a bathrobe.\nFinally, Black-ish star Tracee Ellis Ross reveals why her first Golden Globe win at age 44 connects her to famous mom Diana and her first-meeting fail with Moonlight's Trevante Rhodes. She goes on to explain why it's important that her series Black-ish let viewers draw their own conclusions instead of telling people what to think or believe.\nLATE NIGHT ON SOCIAL\nRate the Late Night Podcast on iTunes: itunes.com/LateNightSeth\nSubscribe to Late Night on YouTube: youtube.com/LateNightSeth\nFollow Late Night on Twitter: twitter.com/LateNightSeth\nLike Late Night on Facebook: www.facebook.com/LateNightSeth\nFind Late Night on Snapchat: snapchat.com/add/LateNightSeth\nGet more Late Night with Seth Meyers: www.nbc.com/late-night-with-seth-meyers/\nWatch Late Night with Seth Meyers Weeknights 12:35/11:35c on NBC.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
