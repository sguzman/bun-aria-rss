  "description": "Today I will be reviewing 'Financial Intelligence' by Karen Berman and Joe Knight. Being financially literate is rare in our world. We are taught many things in school, but only accountants and finance experts know this information in the business world. This book aims to solve that problem. It focusses on explaining critical financial concepts such as the purpose of the profit and loss sheet, balance sheet and cash flow, as well as their relationship to one another. The topics are not too tough as the authors do not go into a lot of depth, but for a beginner, it may take some time to understand. Nevertheless, it will be useful for anyone wanting to understand the financials of the business they work for and if they are looking to create their own business. I can't see this as a book for readers to casually pick and read as it has a purpose behind it. If you want to increase your financial knowledge, you should read this book.\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
