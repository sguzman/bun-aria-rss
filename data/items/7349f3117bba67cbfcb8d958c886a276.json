In his new book Happy People Are Annoying Josh talks about how <strong>he</strong> <strong>had to face life on life’s terms, and define what happiness meant to him as a unique individual</strong>. He realized that <strong>external things like marriage, money, success, drugs, sex, or food will not fill up the “hole in the soul”. &nbsp;True, lasting peace and comfort come from doing the inner work</strong>. As Josh notes, he could not use external things to medicate things deep within himself.</p>\n<p>Read the show blog here:&nbsp;https://drleaf.com/blogs/news/why-happy-people-are-annoying-with-actor-josh-peck</p>\n<p>Get his new book here: https://www.harpercollins.com/products/happy-people-are-annoying-josh-peck?variant=39914222223394</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>OFFERS FROM OUR SPONSORS:</p>\n<p>-<strong>Primally Pure: For an exclusive offer for my listeners go to </strong><a href=\"https://primallypure.com/\"><u><strong>primallypure.com</strong></u></a><strong> and Get 10% off your order with the code DRLEAF</strong></p>\n<p><strong>-Athletic Greens:&nbsp;To make it easy, Athletic Greens is going to give you a FREE 1 year supply of immune-supporting Vitamin D AND 5 FREE travel packs with your first purchase.
