  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, if we can't keep the biggest city in America safe, we're failing as a society. Presumably, one man, wearing a gas mask set off a smoke bomb and shot passengers inside a New York City subway car. And at a moment's notice, the NYPD and the FDNY were on the scene. The same NYPD that was lambasted as racist as pro-crime progressive politicians fought to defund the police. The NYPD has named Frank R. James as a person of interest in the attack. Simultaneously, the Lt. Governor of New York just resigned because he was arrested on corruption charges earlier today. Meanwhile, the NY Governor hasn't even been elected because she was the previous Lt. Governor that had to step in when former Governor Cuomo resigned as he faced sexual misconduct charges. Then, President Biden is gutting Title IX which allowed women into college sports. Now the left wants to destroy that, and an incoming Supreme Court Justice refuses to even define what a woman is to remain in lockstep with their radical agenda. Women's rights and feminism can't work if you can't define what a woman is. Later, Prime Minister Boris Johnson visited President Zelenskyy in Ukraine, while Biden stayed in Delaware and said that \"they\" said he couldn't go. Putin is said to be recruiting retired veterans to continue their offensive against Ukraine. Afterward, a member of the Disney family took to CNN to bash Florida's Parental Rights in Education law. Abigail Disney claims that this is paranoia over the gender issue while parents simply prefer to keep the conversation out of classrooms filled with five to ten-year-old’s. This sabotages the family, and our only hope is to beat the left at the ballot box.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
