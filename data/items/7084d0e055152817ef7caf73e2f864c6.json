  "description": "On Friday’s Mark Levin show, what happened to Omarosa or John Brennan and his security clearance? See how quickly the media jump from one “scandal” to another? They are grabbing onto anything they hope will bring down President Trump. Now we have the latest breaking story - Trump Organization CFO Allen Weisselberg was granted immunity in the Michael Cohen probe. This is of zero legal consequence because at the end of the day the DOJ memorandum says a sitting president can’t be indicted. Because Trump cannot be indicted, he will not have a chance to defend himself in a court of law. Trump will be tried in the media instead, and the Democrats will use special counsel Robert Mueller’s report to make the case for impeachment. What’s happened here is diabolical and evil. Also, the government must prove that the Trump campaign violations are in fact illegal, but they can't. Cohen took the plea deal; to protect his wife that was rumored to be implicated in his case. So now their game is guilt by association, if Cohen pled guilty, therefore Trump must be guilty, but this isn't so. Finally, Salena Zito calls in to discuss facebook’s censorship of her NY Post story on Cohen and Paul Manafort for not meeting community standards.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
