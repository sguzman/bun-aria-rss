    "media:description": "Calculus, originally called infinitesimal calculus or \"the calculus of infinitesimals\", is the mathematical study of continuous change, in the same way that geometry is the study of shape and algebra is the study of generalizations of arithmetic operations.\n\nThis course is about calculus 2. In this course you will learn the following topics:\n⭐️ Table of Contents ⭐️  \n⌨️ (0:00:00) Direction field and Euler's method\n⌨️ (0:18:18) Linear Equation\n⌨️ (0:37:24) Predator-prey system\n⌨️ (0:52:30) Sequences\n⌨️ (2:20:18) Series\n⌨️ (2:55:59) The integral test\n⌨️ (3:26:38) Comparison test\n⌨️ (3:50:16) Alternating series\n⌨️ (4:13:27) Absolute convergence and the ratio and root tests\n⌨️ (4:41:05) Strategy for testing series\n⌨️ (4:48:35) Power series\n⌨️ (5:11:35) Tylor and Maclaurin series\n\n⭐️ Credit ⭐️\nCourse Author by: Kamuela Yong\nWebsite: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCZ5JattaBe47AndeZxhAFjA/featured\n\n⭐️ Join Us ⭐️\nJoin our FB Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/cslesson\nLike our FB Page: https://www.facebook.com/cslesson/​\nWebsite: https://cslesson.org/",
