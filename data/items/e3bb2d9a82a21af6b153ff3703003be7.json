  "description": "<p>It's time to light that cauldron and get yourself even more excited than you already are as THE GAMES HAVE OFFICIALLY BEGUN! Yes, that's right, after the...uh...somewhat 'interesting' opening ceremony it's time for your favourite Olympics podcast to go over everything that you just watched and give our very unique take on it in true Off The Podium style! Did it live up to expectations? Did Channel 7 and CBC make fools of themselves already or were we pleasantly surprised at how they handled themselves? Which country had the best outfit? Which had the worst? Did we miss Nikki Webster? Does it make us want to buy treadmills? And has this made us more excited for the next 16 days of competition? Added to our review of the opening ceremony, we also take a look at some of the results that have already come our way so far, look ahead to an epic day 1 of competition happening tomorrow and find some unique ways to bring you some fan engagement for both Canada and Australia! It's all here and more in one epic episode that any Olympic fan can't afford to miss!</p>",
