  "description": "<p>When the days are long, the tantrums are continuous, the sleep is lacking, and the mess abounds; the call to motherhood can feel daunting. Maybe we are completing our tasks, but having joy in the midst of them feels impossible. As time passes, we find ourselves more familiar with a tone of bitterness than a heart of rejoicing. In this episode, Emily and Laura discuss the difference between momentary joy and biblical joy, and the common reasons why it's hard to experience. The good news is, joy is available despite our circumstances, because Jesus offers an unchanging hope.</p> <p>Like what you hear? Visit <a href= \"http://www.risenmotherhood.com\">www.risenmotherhood.com</a> for links to additional articles and resources on this topic. You'll also find more encouragement and truth on how to be an intentional mother that cares for and loves her children with eternity in mind. And if you get a chance, we'd love for you to subscribe and/or leave a review in iTunes!</p>",
