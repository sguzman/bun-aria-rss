  "description": "The World Economic Forum has responded to Glenn’s comments about America’s new “oligarchy.\" The WEF wants \"stakeholder capitalism,\" but who are the stakeholders? Texas Attorney General Ken Paxton talks how fast President Biden has been moving and a federal judge blocking Biden’s order to pause deportations. The media float the idea of triple masking, so Glenn and Stu go on the search for the perfect number. Economic policy expert Brian Riedl takes on the $15 minimum wage and how it would decimate the economy. BlazeTV host Steve Deace talks \"the COVID miracle\" under Biden and the country’s trajectory toward an oligarchy. Glenn reviews Biden’s new \"Made in America Office” (or MAO), which sounds good, but is terrifyingly vague.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
