  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, Is Elijah Cummings a racist? The media has made it clear that this word \"infested\" is Hitlerian and secretly-suggests racist undertones when used.  However, new audio surfaces of Elijah Cummings in 1999 saying that Baltimore is \"infested!\"  By the Congressman's own admission Baltimore is so \"drug-infested\" and that young men are walking around like zombies. Why would he use the word zombies to describe the men of color in his district? Why are Democrats fascinated with falsely charging people with racism?  Last night's democrat debate featured the word racism as a mainstay of the candidates, yet not a single one mentioned that it was the Democrat Party that created the KKK and the Jim Crow laws.  Later, Canadian continues to suffer long waits at the hands of their government-run health care system. The so-called free system turns out to cost way more than Canadians have bargained for and the demand for these 'free' services drive up demand while driving down the quality of care. The long waits for care and medication shortages are hiding in plain sight. The media, in their complicity, just sits there allowing it to happen without asking questions to clarify the facts.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
