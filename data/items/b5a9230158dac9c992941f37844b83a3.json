From his near death on the race track, to his guest spot on The Dukes Of Hazzard, to one of his many run ins with the law, he always lived by one bit of wisdom... Never, ever learn from your mistakes. And he mastered that. Survive being a human fireball, always run from the police, and do every drug you can get your hands on with David \"Salt\" Walther!!
