  "description": "<p>To send off the current generation of consoles, we decided to do something a little special.\nThere are no winners or losers this week, just our fondest memories from one of gaming's longest console cycles. I had a nice time recording this episode. Like Justin and Griffin, I started covering games professionally during this generation. I can plot my entire career alongside its big releases, studio openings, studio closures, small conferences, big conferences and comic conferences. When the Xbox 360 came out, I was still in college. That's strange to think about.\nShare a few of your best memories from this generation in the comments. Let's have an old-fashioned reminiscence.\n<p>4:00 - Watching Nintendo reveal the Wii</p>\n<p>13:15 - Being an early adopter of Rock Band</p>\n<p>25:00 - Halftime - Call of Duty: Ghosts</p>\n<p>37:00 - Finishing Portal 2</p>\n<p>42:00 - Playing through Oblivion with the McElroy clan<br />\n1:01:00 - The winner is everyone!</p>\n<p>Theme song by Ian Dorsch<br />\nGet the show:</p>\n<p>Download MP3\"<br />\nSubscribe to the podcast (RSS)<br />\nSubscribe on iTunes</p></p>\n",
