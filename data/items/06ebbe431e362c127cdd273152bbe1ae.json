  "title": "Kelly Olson, \"Masculinity and Dress in Roman Antiquity\" (Routledge, 2020)",
  "description": "In Masculinity and Dress in Roman Antiquity (Routledge, 2020), Olson argues that clothing functioned as part of the process of communication by which elite male influence, masculinity, and sexuality were made known and acknowledged, and furthermore that these concepts interconnected in socially significant ways. This volume also sets out the details of masculine dress from literary and artistic evidence and the connection of clothing to rank, status, and ritual. This is the first monograph in English to draw together the myriad evidence for male dress in the Roman world, and examine it as evidence for men's self-presentation, status, and social convention.\nReyes Bertolin is a professor of Classics at the University of Calgary.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
