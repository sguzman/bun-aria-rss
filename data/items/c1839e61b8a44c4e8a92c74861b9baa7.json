  "description": "Kara and Scott talk about what it means for Amazon to be paying (minimal) taxes, as Jeff Bezos is \"going Hollywood\", and the company battles with the government over JEDI. They also revisit Google's quiet dismissal of top executives -- the company's longtime head of HR left this week. This week, the FTC ordered the big tech companies -- Facebook, Amazon, Google, Microsoft, Apple -- to hand over information about all the mergers and acquisitions that were too small to report over the past decade. In listener mail, we hear about Class Pass -- the decade's first \"unicorn\" -- and the fitness industry in general. Scott predicts that eventually India will ban Facebook.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
