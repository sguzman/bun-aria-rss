  "description": "On the Best of Mark Levin, the Biden Administration, the public education system, and the media are sabotaging and betraying the people of this country. The American Marxists work together to politicize science for their own benefit. Democrats in the White House are crippling the American fossil fuel industry while inflation continues rising. All while blue-collar energy workers and their families bear the initial brunt of it. Climate change, COVID, and Critical Race Theory are all designed to scare you and they should. Now there's Omicron. A variant that even the Doctor that discovered it says causes mild symptoms. Moreover, the President of South Africa says there will be no travel bans or lockdowns. Anthony Fauci announces the first Omicron variant case which emerged in San Francisco, CA, and the infected individual was fully vaccinated. Fauci still can't find an answer to why border crossers are being admitted into the country without testing or vaccinations. Black Lives Matter has announced a hateful boycott against \"White\" businesses. Americans must become patriotic activists and do business wisely. BLM fails to realize that this will hurt Black athletes, entertainers, and employees employed at these very same White enterprises such as the NFL, ESPN, and many others. So many American corporations have become so wildly unpatriotic as many hedge funds invest in communist China as do so many sports teams and news networks. Incidentally, communist China is also subsidized in the Build Back Better bill and offers a sweetheart deal for labor unions but not for employees in the private sector.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
