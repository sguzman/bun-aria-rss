  "title": "Episode #68: Why mindfulness is not enough + 5 steps to overcoming a mental health crisis",
  "description": "Mindfulness is a very hot topic now. And there are many benefits to being mindful through prayer or meditation. However, research has shown that mindfulness is not enough to help create sustainable healthy mental habits. We need to go beyond mindfulness. In this episode I discuss the benefits of mindfulness, and how to go beyond this first step. I also discuss the correct way to use mindfulness and the other 4 steps to deal with a crisis in the heat of the moment. This is the fourth episode in my Think Learn Succeed Podcast Series. \nTo get even more tips and tools to help you improve your mental health be sure to sign up for my weekly newsletter: https://drleaf.com\nThe SWITCH app is coming to iTunes and Google Play early 2019!!\nFor more info on my new app SWITCH go to: https://theswitch.app. get 30% off a year subscription when you pre-order today: http://theswitch.app/promo/\nAbout the 2019 Mental Health Initiative:\nI am making 2019 the year of mental health! Each month I will tackle a specific problem, issue, and concept related to mental ill health. I will be discussing major issues in the current mental health system AND how to find healing for yourself or a loved one.\nI’m excited to announce that for the February and March Mental Health Initiative we are going to be doing another book club! Over the next eight weeks we will be going through my latest book, Think Learn Succeed!\nI decided to spread the book over two months because there is just so much to unpack and discuss. Like the January Perfect You book club, there will be weekly YouTube Live sessions that go over the assigned chapters as well as blogs and podcasts related to topics and concepts in Think Learn Succeed.\nHow you understand and use your mind is predictive of how successful you will be. Nothing will work unless you get your mind right first. Think Learn Succeed is all about helping you make that switch to a life well-lived, filled with meaningful success.\nSo how do you join the book club?\n1. Get the book!
