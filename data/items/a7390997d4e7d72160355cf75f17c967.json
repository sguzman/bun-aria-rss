  "title": "OPRAH WINFREY: THE CLIMB",
  "description": "<p>Oprah says, “I have always thought a mountain is a magnificent metaphor for life. From a distance, the ascent looks clear and smooth, but once you actually set out for the summit, you discover unexpected valleys and precarious ridges along the way. If your internal compass isn’t set to keep climbing, every stumble will give you an excuse to turn back. Over the years, there have been many times when I’ve found myself climbing a steep rocky road and there have been setbacks which threatened to overwhelm me or stop me in my tracks. But I’ve learned to keep going and to tell myself, <em>‘This too shall pass and I will be better for it.’</em> In this Super Soul podcast, Oprah sits down with such legendary spiritual teachers and thought leaders as: Eckhart Tolle, Stephen Colbert, President Joe Biden (VP at the time), Father Richard Rohr, Kristen and Rob Bell, Alanis Morissette, Cheryl Strayed, Paul Williams, Tracey Jackson, Glennon Doyle, Tracy McMillan, Cindy Crawford, Jon Bon Jovi and Joel Osteen. They discuss how they made their way up their own mountains, and what kept them going, no matter how steep the climb. A similar path is waiting for you. Interviews with these talented writers, speakers and thought leaders are excerpted from her Emmy Award-winning show Super Soul Sunday. You can also find this compilation and other insightful conversations, in Oprah’s best-selling book <em>The Path Made Clear.</em></p>\n",
