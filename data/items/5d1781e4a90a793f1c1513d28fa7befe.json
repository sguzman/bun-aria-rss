  "description": "You can’t live very long without being injured and going through hurts and pains. Sometimes the wound heals up and you don’t have any sign that it ever happened. But there are certain injuries that are so severe, a cut so deep that when they heal up, the pain goes away, but they leave a scar.Maybe you have been scarred by a divorce, by what somebody said, by a mistake you made, or by a loss. Joel wants to show you how you don’t have to try to hide your scars or be embarrassed by what you’ve been through. You can be at peace with your scars. God is going to take your wounds and turn them into beautiful scars. Let your scars be a reminder of the grace and goodness of God.<p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
