  "description": "<p>Criticism rarely comes wrapped in a shiny gift box, tied with a bow. As a trailblazing leader, one of Mellody Hobson’s gifts is finding the diamond in the rough. She and Adam unpack how to look for the grain of truth in any critique, when to discount feedback, and what it takes to be honest without being brutal.

You can listen to them right here in the WorkLife feed, or by following ReThinking with Adam Grant wherever you are right now. </p>",
