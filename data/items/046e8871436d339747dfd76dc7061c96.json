  "description": "<p>It doesn’t matter if the market is flying high, or if it’s dropping faster than we’ve seen in history, each one of us is capable of making the occasional dumb decision, and it’s simply because we’re human! There are certain tendencies ingrained in us that can cause us to approach the world and our personal finances in an irrational way. Some of the hardest money mistakes to correct are ones that we make habitually because we don’t recognize the patterns that may have led us there. In order to break those bad money habits, sometimes it means taking a step back and figuring out what those behavioral tendencies are! The better we are at identifying these behavioral tendencies, the more likely we are to be able to make better decisions that will have a positive impact on how we view and handle our money.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed an IDKFA by Ellipsis Brewing - thanks to Joel for picking this one up while he was down in Orlando. And as we ramp up the podcast with an additional Friday episode every week, we could really use your help to spread the word- let friends and family know about How to Money!
