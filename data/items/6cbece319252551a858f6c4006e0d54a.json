  "description": "<div>#176: Dr. Barbara Sturm is a German aesthetics doctor based out of Dusseldorf, Germany. She is world-recognized for non-surgical anti-aging treatments and rejuvenation of the skin matrix. Dr. Barbara was part of a medical discovery known as the “Kobe Procedure” (as in Kobe Bryant) where a patient’s own blood cells are used to produce proteins to jumpstart the healing process. This process later became known as Vampire Facials. She is also the founder of her Molecular Cosmetics skin care line.
