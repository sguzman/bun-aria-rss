  "description": "<p>50 years ago NASA astronauts took a picture that changed the world. It was a full color photo of planet Earth as seen from space. This image inspired many to think differently about our home. </p>\n<p>In this episode we'll tell the tale of that epic snapshot. Plus we'll explain how Earth and our solar system formed in the first place. We'll talk to astrophysicist Lindy Elkins-Tanton about whether there are other planets like Earth in the universe. Plus we have an all new Mystery Sound and a Moment of Um that answers the question “Why do dreams seem longer than they are?” </p>\n<p>So say cheese and enjoy!
