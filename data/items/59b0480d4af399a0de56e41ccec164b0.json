  "title": "Can China’s GDP data be trusted?",
  "description": "This week, China released its third quarter GDP figure. At 3.9%, its rate of economic growth is better than many analysts expected, but still significantly short of the 5.5% target the Chinese government had set itself. \n\nThere was an unprecedented delay in releasing this particular GDP stat - and that delay coincided with the 20th Chinese Communist Party congress.  President Xi Jinping was reappointed for a historic third term at the twice-a-decade gathering. \n\nSome analysts found the delay suspicious. Did President Xi postpone the release of the GDP figures so it wouldn’t tarnish the congress? And can the figure of 3.9 per cent be trusted anyway? \n\nPaul Connolly investigates with the help of John Burn Murdoch, Chief Data Reporter at The Financial Times; Associate Professor of Government at Cornell, Jeremy Lee Wallace and Dr Linda Yueh, Oxford University economist and author.   \n\nPresenter and Producer: Paul Connolly  \nEditor: Simon Watts  \nProgramme Coordinator: Jacqui Johnson  \nSound Engineer: Neva Missirian  \n\n(Image: Chinese President Xi Jinping: Mark R Cristino/EPA-EFE/REX/Shutterstock)",
