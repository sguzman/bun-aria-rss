  "description": "Mirror, mirror on the wall...why do I see my reflection at all? On this 12 minute episode of Who Smarted? our Evil Queen will learn how her Magic Mirror works, why we all look different in photos than in the mirror, the science behind how mirrors are made, and the surprising history of the first mirrors!\nYour kids will discover that the first mirrors were made from rocks - yes, rocks! Specifically obsidian, which is a shiny volcanic rock that can be polished to a glass-like finish.\nThey will learn that modern mirrors are mostly made by spraying aluminum onto glass.\nAnd they will learn the reason your face often looks weird in photos is simply because you spend more time looking in mirrors, which flip your image. A photo is actually truer to what other people actually see -- but because you rarely see yourself that way it 'flips you out.'\nListen anywhere you get your podcasts including Apple Podcasts, Google,Spotify, Stitcher, OR at our siteWho Smarted?, where you can also get a FREE episode guide with more information and activities for the kids.\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
