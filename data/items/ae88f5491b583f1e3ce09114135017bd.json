  "description": "On the Best of Mark Levin, If we can't keep the biggest city in America safe, we're failing as a society. Presumably, one man, wearing a gas mask set off a smoke bomb and shot passengers inside a New York City subway car. And at a moment's notice, the NYPD and the FDNY were on the scene. A member of the Disney family took to CNN to bash Florida's Parental Rights in Education law. Abigail Disney claims that this is paranoia over the gender issue while parents simply prefer to keep the conversation out of classrooms filled with five to ten-year-old’s. This sabotages the family, and our only hope is to beat the left at the ballot box. Frank R. James was captured by the NYPD with the help of a citizen. He’s a systemically racist, terrorist slob that posted lots of White hate online. James, who has 11 prior arrests, will face multiple charges as the investigation continues. Despite all the censorship from Big Tech, James's social media posts, suggesting the killing of others, were never taken down by any social media platforms. Elon Musk, made a $43 Billion offer to buy Twitter to preserve free speech on the platform. But Wall Street investment group Vanguard Group has purchased more shares to become the largest shareholder at Twitter and block Musk.  It's also been reported that the Department of Justice and the Securities and Exchange Commission have launched a joint investigation into Musk's companies. New York City Mayor Eric Adams questioned where the Black Lives Matters protesters were as he asked the community why young Black men victims are getting shot in Black neighborhoods.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
