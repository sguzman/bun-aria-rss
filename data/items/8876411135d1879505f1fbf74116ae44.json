  "description": "Environmental crises are making headlines in the news everyday. As public awareness increases about brownfields, pollutants, and water quality, Phyto: Principals and Resources for Site Remediation and Landscape Design (Routledge, 2015) is the tool to mediate those pressing issues. The authors are both landscape architects who address “how to” contain and mediate through phytotechnologies the pollutants humans have used in the environment. The book demonstrates what we can, and the limitations of what we can do, to create healthy beautifully designed ecological sensitive environments for humans, plants, and animals.\nKate Kennen is a landscape architect from Boston MA and founder of Offshoot, Inc. Her undergraduate is from Cornell University and master’s degree from Harvard Graduate School with distinction. She began this study about plant remediation as an undergraduate and it bloomed (pun intended) into an amazing book of tools and recommendations for students and practitioners to incorporate plants to create healthy and beautiful environments.\nNiall Kirkwood has been teaching at Harvard Graduate School of Design since 1992. His research topics relate to sustainable reuse of land and urban regeneration. His publications include Manufactured Sites: Rethinking the Post-Industrial Landscape (Routledge), Principals of Brownfield Regeneration (Island Press), and Weathering and Durability in Landscape Architecture (Wiley). He is a Fellow of the American Society of Landscape Architects and is a visiting professor to University of Ulster, Korea University, and Tsinghua University.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
