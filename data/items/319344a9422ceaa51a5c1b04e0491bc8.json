  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, so what do we with committee chairs conspiring to impeach the president through strategic leaks to the media? Republicans should stand up to this betrayal of our Constitutional order and file an appropriate ethics complaint. The democrats are targeting pollsters, the President’s family members, current and former attorneys of the Trump campaign, the Trump Organization, and even the president. They want to bring in 81 private individuals, vendors and private companies to testify and provide documents in an attempt to smear and destroy them. This is designed like a military campaign to attack secretaries, executives, and everyone in between in order to attack Trump from every angle. This is an unconscionable attack on the republic, let alone on the office of the presidency. This is an abuse of power and abuse of federal funds to burden Trump's friends, family, and staff so they can ultimately burn down this country! Then, Ilhan Omar has been reprimanded by Congress. Despite her statements regarding her comments about pledging allegiance to other nations, a tongue-in-cheek reference to Israel. These not so veiled attempts at Israel have become very common in the Democratic Party. Later, CNN has been placed on a special monitoring list by the National Association of Black Journalists (NABJ) for a lack of black employees reporting to CEO Jeff Zucker.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
