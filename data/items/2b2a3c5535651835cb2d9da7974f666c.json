  "description": "Hey everyone! We're here with The Duke Who Didn't by Courtney Milan! We LOVED this fabulous historical about an ambitious, list-loving heroine named Chloe Fong and the charismatic hero named Jeremy Yu who's come to convince her that he wants to marry her. Except, she doesn't know he's a Duke. She also has way too much to do trying to make her father's revenge sauce a roaring success and put the British colonists who took advantage of him out of business. But don't worry! They smooch! \n Bonus content: Our Patreon fundraiser supporting AAPI Women Lead, the fact that Mary Jane Wells is an audio wonder, THAT AUTHOR’S NOTE, The Taiping Tianguo and Melody tripping over history she actually knows, Mel and Erin history right in front of you regarding trains and telegraphs and HARD FACTS, Erin implores all romance authors to be brave and DESCRIBE THE DIARRHEA, and so much more!\n Lady Loves: \n Erin: There's an update to Stardew Valley where there's an island and a new character that Erin was hoping she could woo, but is actually a child and she no longer wants to romance at all in his vicinity.\n Melody: the Disney movie ABOMINABLE!!!! IT'S SO GOOOOOD! 3 kids help a baby yeti get back to Mount Everest and, while it does mean things involving the song \"Fix You\" there's also this blueberry scene that made my 5 year old and I literally fall on the floor laughing. \n Subscribe!
