  "description": "<p>Dave Smith met me in my apartment to give me the rundown on what's happened in America over the last year. He pays way more attention to all sides of the news than anyone I know, and he's a libertarian, so he can see both parties with equal disgust. Plus we talk about police racial violence. And top it off with some healthy discussion of my butthole. We're going to do this every year, so hopefully you like it.</p>",
