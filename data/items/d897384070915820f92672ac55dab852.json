    "media:description": "Triple trick shooting\nLong before I started with trick archery was the impressive American archer Byron Ferguson .\nHe has hit very small target\nHas hit target blindfolded\nAnd hit target with his feet\n\nJust for fun I would try it all at once\nA small bell 13 mm\nBlindfolded\nBow held with feet\n\nI thought it was almost impossible\nbut surprisingly it only took 5 minutes to film.\n\nA very lucky shot.\nIt could be filmed better and in good slow motion.\nBut I got the idea and immediately put up a camera\njust to see if it was possible.\nMade a few try throws\nand then I hit (it was seen by others)\nSo I do not want to make a better version!\n\nThe bow used in this video Grózer 49 # 28 \"\n\nMusic:\n\"Christmas rap\" Kevin MacLeod\n\nMerry Christmas and Happy New Year\nLars Andersen",
