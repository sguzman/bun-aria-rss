  "description": "There's a proverb that goes \"Beloved children have many names.\" That's at least as true when it comes to the names we give our pets. \"Fluffy\" becomes \"Fluffers\" becomes \"FluffFace\" becomes \"FlufferNutter, Queen of the Universe.\" Speaking of the celestial, how DID the top politician in California come to be named Governor Moonbeam, anyway? Blame it on a clever newspaper columnist. And: still more names for those slowpokes in the left-turn lane. Plus munge and kludge, monkey blood and chopped liver, a German word for pout, and the land of the living.\n Read full show notes, hear hundreds of free episodes, send your thoughts and questions, and learn more on the A Way with Words website: https://waywordradio.org/.
