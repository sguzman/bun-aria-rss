  "description": "So you want to build an offshore wind farm. Are you prepared to manage the marine ecosystem impacts of construction? What about monitoring and protecting underwater electrical cables?\nOr maybe you want to decarbonize shipping. Do you know how to trace low-carbon fuel through ports or maintain storage tanks in marine environments? How about managing worker safety on the ocean?\nThese are the kinds of questions that crop up at the intersection of climatetech and something called bluetech, the range of technologies that touch the oceans. And this marine-based expertise may prove invaluable to climate solutions. \nIn this episode, Shayle talks to Alissa Peterson, co-founder and chief executive officer of SeaAhead, an organization that supports and incubates bluetech companies. They survey a range of technologies, covering topics like:\n\nAlternative low-carbon fuels for shipping, such as ammonia, methanol and hydrogen\n\nAlternative proteins, fisheries and kelp\n\nOceanic carbon removal, such as ocean alkalinity enhancement and sinking kelp to the bottom of the seabed \n\nIn the U.S., will big coastal infrastructure, like offshore wind, suffer the same fate as long-distance transmission lines, stalling in an overly strict regulatory environment?\n\nRecommended Resources:\n\n\nCanary Media: Zero-emissions cargo shipping catches on in cities and port communities\n\n\nCanary Media: Offshore wind installations surged threefold last year\n\n\nSeaAhead : Innovation in Offshore Wind Reverse Pitch\n\n\nMIT Technology Review: Companies hoping to grow carbon-sucking kelp may be rushing ahead of the science\n\nCatalyst is a production of Post Script Media and Canary Media.\nCatalyst is supported by Scale Microgrid Solutions, your comprehensive source for all distributed energy financing.
