  "description": "<p>Meet your new friend Astronautalis! He’s a hip hop artist from Minneapolis that has a rich history within independent music as you will hear from the show. We talk about his first tour ever, The Vans Warped Tour (which is insane), freestyle rap being a parlor trick and rave culture in the 90’s. It’s a bit of a different discussion than the show typically has, but a very engaging and interesting one. Check out his new LP on Side One Dummy called Cut The Body Loose as it is really, REALLY good. Enjoy!
