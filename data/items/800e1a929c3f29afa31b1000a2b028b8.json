  "description": "<p>Heat/Lakers Game 4 the Heat tried, they really did (2:27 - 10:45). We talk some playoff baseball and we discuss whether or not we should root for the Astros for maximum chaos. Monday Night Football clean up and Bill O'Brien (10:45 - 29:52). Hot Seat/Cool Throne (29:52 - 44:36). Chris Bosh joins the show to talk about his new music, the NBA Finals, Heat Culture, and does this count for Lebron? (44:36 - 80:07) DK Metcalf joins the show to talk about his awesome start to the season, fumbling at the 1 yard line, apologizing to Hank for that fumble and more (80:07 - 106:57). We finish with guys on chicks.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
