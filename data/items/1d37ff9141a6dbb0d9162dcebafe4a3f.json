  "description": "<p>In this week’s episode, John Maxwell shares the three dimensions of expectation: expectations that we have of ourselves, that we have of others, and that others have of us. More often than not, you won’t get what you don’t expect. That’s why leaders need to set high and realistic expectations for themselves and others.</p> <p>For the application portion of the episode, Mark Cole and Jason Brooks discuss the expectations they set for themselves and the importance of exceeding––not just meeting––the expectations others place on them.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this episode is the Three Dimensions of Expectation Worksheet, which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching. You can download the worksheet by visiting MaxwellPodcast.com/Expect and clicking “Download the Bonus Resource.”</p> <p>References:</p> <p><a href= \"https://www.johnmaxwell.com/changeyourworld/\"><em>Change Your World</em> by John C.
