  "description": "<p>On this BonusCast Diane and Denise are unedited and unscripted as they discuss the Biblical view of ghosts. They examine the general belief in the Church about ghosts, which is way oversimplified and not Biblical and then they look at a couple of ghost examples in the Bible. This broadcast will not be for everybody, but if you do listen, we hope we give you some things to think about and consider. The Bible is one of the most supernatural books and Christianity does not have to be boring or what we see on television: Your best life now and God the big piggy bank in the sky. See if you come to the same conclusions that we do at History Goes Bump. We'd love to hear our listeners thoughts on the topic!</p> <p>Check out the website:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes with Biblical references:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/02/hgb-bonuscast-3-ghosts-and-bible.html\">http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/02/hgb-bonuscast-3-ghosts-and-bible.html</a></p>",
