  "description": "This is Life Effects, a podcast from Slate Studios and Teva Pharmaceuticals. In this episode, we enter the world of caregivers: the relatives and close friends who step up when sick family members need support. Often, it’s a full-time job, so it's not surprising that these caregivers can end up neglecting their own health. \nHost Sara Ivry discusses this dilemma with guests Kate Schrock and Dr. Sandy Butler. In a rapid turn of events, Kate Schrock became a single mom raising a newborn and the primary caregiver to her ailing mother. Sara and Kate are also joined by Dr. Sandy Butler, a professor in the School of Social Work and a Resident Scholar at the Center on Aging at the University of Maine. Her primary focus is the health needs and social welfare experiences of low-income women. \nThe individual(s) who have written and created the content in and whose images appear in the articles, profiles, podcasts and videos from the Life Effects program may have been paid by Teva Pharmaceuticals for their contributions.  This content represents the opinions of the contributor and does not necessarily reflect those of Teva Pharmaceuticals.
