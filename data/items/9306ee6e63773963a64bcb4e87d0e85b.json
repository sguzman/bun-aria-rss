  "description": "Is he the biggest Wild Turkey super fan out there? Without a doubt. David Jennings goes by the alter ego RareBird101. In this episode we explore his obsession with older dusty Wild Turkey and even some of the newest  Russell's Reserve offerings. We also spend some time speculating on our theories on what has changed over the years and if Wild Turkey is headed in the right direction with premium offerings.\nShow Notes:\n\nBefore we dive right in, what's your bourbon story?\n\nWhat got you into Wild Turkey?\n\nWhat keeps you interested in Wild Turkey?\n\nTalk about your blog for a minute and what you do at Rarebird101\n\n\nThink about some of those reviews you’ve done, because I’ve seen some real turkey unicorns in there from tradition to split labels to Christmas Rye. Do you have any standout favorites?\n\nWhat is it about cheesy gold foil?\n\nJimmy says nothing has changed. But Be honest, do you think dusty Wild Turkey is better than today?\n\nSince you’ve tasted almost everything in the turkey lineup, any thoughts on recreating that dusty flavor profile?\n\nWe posted on Instagram a while back about waiting in line for a Weller107 store pick because people like us are dumb. You were playing the angle that if everyone focused their attention on Russell's Reserve picks you wouldn’t have to stand in line. I know you have an article on the  10 reasons why you should be buying Russell's Reserve picks, what are some of those favorite reasons of yours?\n\nHow many different Russell's Reserve picks do you have?\n\nIt seems that Wild Turkey limited releases don’t get many accolades. From Diamond to Master’s Keep. What’s you honest opinion? Do you feel they don’t deserve the high dollar or do you?\n\nDid you sleep on Russell's Reserve 1998 like I did?\n\nWhen are you getting your chance to meet  Matt McConaughey?\n\nSupport RareBird101 on Patreon",
