  "description": "In this episode, Fred interviews country music artists Hannah Ellis and Nick Wayne, who recently got engaged. Ellis, a Kentucky native, appeared on Rolling Stone's \"Artists To Watch\" list, while CMT named her one of their \"Next Women of Country.\" The outgoing singer spoke with Fred after a show, and they talked palate preferences, bananas foster and tasting whiskey. Wayne, meanwhile, as a 2019 'Listen Up' Artist by CMT, while Rolling Stone Country touted Nick in late 2018 as its 'Artist You Need To Know.' The laid back Nick talks with Fred about the music business and his songwriting process, and of course, whiskey comes into play as well.\n\nWhiskeys tasted:\nJack Daniel's Barrel Pick (8:18)\nBarrell Bourbon 1 (32:59)\n\nEPISODE SUMMARY\n\nNot only did Hannah go to school with one of Fred's former colleagues, Nick is a bourbon enthusiast who has a song series titled \"Bourbon Neat.\" Here are a few of the topics Fred landed on with his dual guests:\nHannah revealed her love of pizza and charcuterie - anything and everything savory - so Fred did his best to find bourbons to meet her palate halfway.\nShe partook of a Jack Daniel's barrel pick, which satisfied her love of bananas foster and banana-flavored cocktails. I couple of drops of water helped smooth out the whiskey for her.\nAlong the way, Fred points out that Jack Daniel's whiskey is actually a bourbon, but JD chooses to call it a Tennessee Whiskey for marketing purposes. They also get into the prevalence of marketing in a broad sense. As Fred notes, \"Most of everything in this world is marketing, and most marketing is bullshit.\"\nHannah also reveals that her first drink was a margarita, not whiskey, mostly because her dad was a margarita drinker on family vacations.\nFred spoke with Nick about songwriting and why we don't hear the word \"bourbon\" in song often.\nThey also talked about themes in country music, and the prevalence of trucks, tractors and the actual word \"country\" in today's current songs.\nNick talks about his songs that were recorded by Keith Urban and Tim McGraw/Faith Hill.\nOnce the whiskey starts flowing, Nick compares the BCS Bourbon 1 to Stagg Jr., \"but without the burn.\" On the road, he typically drinks Buffalo Trace on the rocks. Nothing wrong with \"budget bourbon.\"\nHe also reveals that Wayne is his middle name and not his last name (his real last name is Richardson), and won't admit that he wishes his first name was Bruce. Who wouldn't want to be called \"Bruce Wayne\"?\n\nQUOTABLES\n\nHannah, talking about her \"breakup\" with bourbon a few years ago, blamed it on a single session of overindulgence: \"A bottle of Wild Turkey did me in.\" Perhaps the quote of the show came from Nick, however, came as he talked about sharing stories over whiskey: \"Bourbon is a sharing spirit but also there's a spirit in it that you start sharing.\"\n\nRESOURCES\n\nFOLLOW HANNAH\n\nhttps://hannahellismusic.com/home\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/hannahellismusic/\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/HannahGreyEllis/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/hannahgreyellis\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/hannahgreyellis\n\nFOLLOW NICK\n\nhttps://www.nickwaynemusic.com/\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/user/hannahgreyellis\n\nhttps://twitter.com/NickWayneMusic\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/nickwaynemusic/\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvb3w7KY_-kM3Krnu-qSAkw\n\nFOLLOW FRED\n\nhtps://www.instagram.com/fredminnick/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/FredMinnick\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyE_GJtYr3yowks2iv1o4jg\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/fred.minnick/\n\nSPONSORS\n\nMichter's: https://michters.com/ \n\nB-Line (Northern Kentucky Bourbon Trail): https://findyoursippingpoint.com/\n\nDistillery 291: https://distillery291.com/\n\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.",
