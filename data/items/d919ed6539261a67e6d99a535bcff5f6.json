  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, a majority of Americans believe that Russia's aggression in Ukraine has a national security implication for the U.S. This slaughter plus Putin’s repeated nuclear threats are even more of a reason to topple Putin. Putin's history of assassinating dissenters and his past with Alexi Navalny seem to be forgotten on the pro-Putin wing of the Democrat and Republican Parties since they're busy attacking NATO. Then, Supreme Court nominee Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson claims that she can't define what a woman is during her senate confirmation hearing. Jackson was pressed on her passivity in sentencing sex offenders (who went on to re-offend) and critical race theory. Later, James O'Keefe joins the show to explain how the federal government spied on Project Veritas by obtaining their emails from Microsoft corporation and then placed a gag order on Microsoft to silence them and keep it secret. It's now been revealed that Uber was also forced to hand over Project Veritas' ride history and it’s unknown how many vendors it approached to violate O'Keefe's first amendment rights. Afterward, Rep Ted Budd joins the show with an update on his campaign for the U.S. Senate in North Carolina.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
