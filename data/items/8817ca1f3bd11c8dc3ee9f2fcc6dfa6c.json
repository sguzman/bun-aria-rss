We wanted to start out this year on the podcast in a way that’s both inspiring and motivating and that included some of our favorite things: playing with fabric and meeting new quilting friends. So, we’re starting the show by giving some tips for organizing and decluttering your fabric stash – we promise that it’s a no-fail plan and will have you thinking about your fabric and your sewing space in a whole new way. Then, we chat with the three amazing ladies from Color of Connection quilt, a non-profit that’s doing all they can to bring together quilters from different races, genders, and backgrounds through a common love of sewing.\nFor more resources from today's show, visit the show notes here: www.allpeoplequilt.com/magazines-more/quilting-podcast/episode-496-how-to-declutter-your-fabric-stash\nEmail us at APQPodcast@meredith.com.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
