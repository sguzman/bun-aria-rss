  "description": "On today's show, Pat and the boys are joined by former Oakland Raiders and Cleveland Browns Head Coach, Hue Jackson. Hue chats about why it is so difficult to win in Cleveland and what he thinks it comes back to. He also gives his thoughts on Freddie Kitchens and whether or not he thinks he has what it takes to be a successful Head Coach in the NFL, breaks down the Colin Kaepernick workout situation in Atlanta which Hue was supposed to lead, discusses what his next coaching stop might be and looks at a couple of situations that he might be interested in, and chats about his time on Hard Knocks and his interesting take on the whole experience (21:28-41:32). Next, former Head Coach of the Memphis Tigers and newly christened HC of the Florida State Seminoles, Mike Norvell calls into the show. He chats about his philosophy for landing recruits and how that job starts immediately upon being hired, how leaving Memphis was one of the toughest decisions he's ever made in his life, why he thinks he'll be successful at Florida State despite the ACC being Clemson's playground for the last several years, and what his involvement will be in the Seminoles bowl game (42:43-59:03). Also included is Pat's takes on all the Saturday NFL games this week (despite not being able to watch them as he'll be a field analyst for the Boca Raton Bowl), and how each and every game has playoff implications. They break down whether or not the Bucs should give Jameis a huge extension, if he would be willing to take a paycut, why this might be the week that the Bills finally take down the Patriots in Foxborough, and how the 49ers and Rams both still have plenty to play for. Pat also reacts to the announcement that Johnny Knoxville is back in the saddle for another Jackass movie that will be released in March of 2021. Today's show is a fun one. Come and laugh with us. Cheers.\n",
