He also shares rich, wonderful stories about his vibrant life as a picture editor in publishing, about the literary set in New York City in the 70s and 80s, about writing during the AIDS epidemic in the 1980s, about the times in a writer’s life when the words don’t come easily, and about the times when they can’t be stopped.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">We are honored and so grateful that Vincent took the time to speak with us, and we hope you enjoy this conversation as much as we did.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">There’s still time to buy the Fated Mates Best of 2021 Book Pack from our friends at <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3bXV8XE\">Old Town Books in Alexandria, VA</a>, and get eight of the books on the list, a Fated Mates sticker and other swag!
