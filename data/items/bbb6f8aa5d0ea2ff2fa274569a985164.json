  "description": "As we prepare for what could be a long and possibly lonely winter of being quarantined, we wanted to share some ideas for hosting a virtual quilt retreat. Hopefully it inspires you to connect with your quilting friends in a new way and still get your sewing fix. We also share a project one of our staff members is working on, some basic info on different types of pins, tips for binding (we promise, you haven’t heard some of these tips before!), and why you may want to use a Project Tracker for your UFO projects.\nFor more resources from today's show, visit the show notes here: www.allpeoplequilt.com/magazines-more/quilting-podcast/episode-483-how-to-host-a-virtual-quilt-retreat\nLearn more about your ad choices.
