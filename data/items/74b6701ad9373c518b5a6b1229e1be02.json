  "description": "<p>This week my guest is Eleanor Kerrigan. When you're one of 10 kids born and raised in South Philly by a single mom and you're dad splits when you're eight, you're destined to be a HoneyDew. I love talking with Eleanor. She feels like family, just not to her dad - we can't say the same about her sister Karen. Eleanor is a remarkable woman. Her strength, courage and desire to forgive and love is nothing short of amazing and I can honestly say the same thing about this episode. Josh Adam Meyers joins as guest co-host. This is what The HoneyDew is all about!</p> <p><a href=\"http://TheHoneyDewPodcast.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">http://TheHoneyDewPodcast.com</a></p>",
