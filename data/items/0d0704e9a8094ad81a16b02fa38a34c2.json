  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, one of the most horrific murder cases in modern history has gotten zero — and I really mean zero — coverage from the American national media. The reason? The victim is a white five-year-old child. The alleged killer is a black man. But this case deserves attention, and we’ll give it the attention it deserves today. Also Five Headlines including a BLM activist claiming that looting is okay because it’s a form of reparations. And in our Daily Cancellation, I’ll cancel all the leftists celebrating over a woman being chosen as Biden’s VP. Apparently these leftists have forgotten that women don’t exist anymore, according to them. So I will remind them.\n\nIf you like The Matt Walsh Show, become a member TODAY with promo code: WALSH and enjoy the exclusive benefits for 10% off at https://www.dailywire.com/walsh\nLearn more about your ad choices.
