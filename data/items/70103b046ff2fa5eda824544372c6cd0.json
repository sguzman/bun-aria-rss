  "description": "Suffering and death are two topics that are frequently referred to in the Epistle to the Hebrews, but have rarely been examined within scholarship on this New Testament book. Join us as we talk with Bryan Dyer about his own study of these themes, and then discover how he connects them to the social situation addressed in Hebrews. In his book, Suffering in the Face of Death: The Epistle to the Hebrews and Its Context of Situation (Bloomsbury, 2017), Bryan reveals how the author of Hebrews is responding to the reality of suffering in the lives of his audience. With this awareness, it becomes clear how the Epistle also responds to the audiences pain by creating models of endurance in suffering and death. These serve to motivate the author’s audience toward similar endurance within their own social context.\n\nBryan R. Dyer earned his Ph.D. at McMaster Divinity College. He is Acquisitions Editor at Baker Press, USA, and Adjunct Professor at Calvin College in Grand Rapids, MI. In addition to his book Suffering in the Face of Death, Bryan is also co-editor of The Synoptic Problem, The Bible and Social Justice, and Paul and Ancient Rhetoric.\n\n\n\nMichael Morales is Professor of Biblical Studies at Greenville Presbyterian Theological Seminary, and the author of The Tabernacle Pre-Figured: Cosmic Mountain Ideology in Genesis and Exodus (Peeters, 2012), and Who Shall Ascend the Mountain of the Lord?: A Biblical Theology of Leviticus (IVP Academic, 2015).
