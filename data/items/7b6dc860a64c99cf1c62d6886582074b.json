  "description": "Frank Holmes, CEO and chief investment officer of U.S. Global Investors, is back on Wall Street Unplugged. We kick things off by discussing the pullback in the markets… Frank explains why he believes the selloff is nearing a bottom… and why he doesn’t expect interest rates to rise significantly this year. [2:00] Frank recently launched his own exchange-traded fund: the U.S. Global Sea to Sky Cargo ETF (SEA)—which gives investors access to some of the best shipping companies in the world. He highlights why everyone should have exposure to this sector right now… and how he picks assets for the fund. [4:40] Turning to gold, I ask why gold prices aren’t higher right now given the favorable market conditions. Frank breaks down how gold prices can be manipulated… and shares a strategy from the crypto-mining “playbook” that gold miners should start using. [14:05] As executive chairman of crypto mining firm HIVE Blockchain Technologies, Frank knows a lot about this subject. He highlights how gamers are making some serious money off of crypto… HIVE’s environmental, social, and governance (ESG) strategy for its mining operations… and the massive growth his firm is seeing. [21:20] He also explains the different types of chips used for mining particular cryptos… [29:30] Next, Frank breaks down the difference between “proof of work” (PoW) and “proof of stake” (PoS)... and why fears over Ethereum’s switch from the former to the latter are overblown. [39:00] We wrap up with Frank comparing the short-term headwinds for crypto vs. the long-term tailwinds… and why he expects prices to move much higher over time. [44:40] Enjoyed this episode?
