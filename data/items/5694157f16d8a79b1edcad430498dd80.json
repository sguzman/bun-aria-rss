Jase shares how families can get beyond the \"Why me?\" questions when they face adversity in their lives and the hardest part of helping a child — or teenager — going through what Mia has faced in her young life. Phil gripes at being kicked out of the house so Miss Kay could teach some college kids how to make chicken and dumplings. Phil and Jase have the same alarm system for unannounced visitors. Jase's frog hunt adventure led him to wonder why the first reaction to danger is to pull out a camera, rather than deal with the dangerous situation? \n\nGo to https://fastgrowingtrees.com/robertson & get 15% off your entire order, now through October 31! \n\nhttps://coveyes.com/phil/ — Try Covenant Eyes FREE for 30 days! \n-\nLearn more about your ad choices.
