  "description": "Charles Stuart. October 23, 1989. Boston, Massachusetts. A man and his wife pulled up to a stoplight. Just minutes earlier they had left a hospital after attending a birthing class. Things had been looking up for them. They were financially well off and expecting their first child. But, according to the husband, they were intercepted at the stoplight by a man who decided to shoot them before leaving. The husband was Charles Stuart who called police on his car phone to report the shooting. He had been shot in his side and Carol was shot in the head. As the people of Boston became aware of the crime a rage swelled. Carol Stuart, Charles' wife, died. Weeks later, her child died as well. But police had a description of the killer and they stopped at nothing in their pursuit of justice. After an arrest was made in the case there was a great sense of relief. Soon after, though, someone contacted police claiming to be involved and the whole case would take a strange turn. This is a true crime story that you won't want to miss.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
