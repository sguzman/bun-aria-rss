  "description": "On today's show, Pat is joined by Super Bowl Champion, 8x Pro Bowler, 7x All-Pro, member of 2010's All-Decade Team, surefire 1st ballot Hall of Famer, Marshal Yanda. Pat and Marshal talk about how much weight he's dropped since he retired, and how he understands that he was essentially forcing himself to stay as big as he was, they look back on his career as a whole, look at what he wants to do next, he chats about what it is like blocking for Lamar Jackson, why the injuries were the main cause for retirement, how the locker room changed during the course of his career, and keeping young bucks in line when they were talking too much crap in an incredible conversation(1:08-29:08). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk where Pat and AJ discuss everything that happened with the UFC 249 card and what some of the biggest takeaways were and why it was so huge for sports in not only the United States, but the world. They also give their reactions to episodes 7 and 8 of The Last Dance and continue to realize why Michael Jordan was such a unique specimen, discuss the NCAA decision to not play college football if no students are back on campuses, and everything else that has been circulating around the sports world (31:15-2:12:57). Lastly, friend of the show, former GM for the Cleveland Browns, 3x Super Bowl Champion, and host of the GM Shuffle Podcast, Michael Lombardi joins the program. Pat and Michael chat about Stephen Jones' comments about Dallas not spending too much money on Dak Prescott and whether that is a leverage play, why Bill Belichick hasn't openly said anything about his quarterback competition and why he doesn't think it'll be a big deal, where he ultimately thinks Cam Newton will end up (potentially the Patriots?), and what he thinks about Big Ben's outlook heading into this season (2:14:52-2:35:03). Today's show is a good one. Don't forget to send in the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat with a picture of where you're listening to the show for the chance to win some free merch. Come and laugh with us, cheers.\n",
