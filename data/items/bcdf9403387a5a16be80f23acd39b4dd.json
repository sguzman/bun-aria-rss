  "description": "<p>Why do we think the way we do? Is our thinking determined by cultural and societal factors or are we true independent thinkers? ðŸ¤” &nbsp;This is what Nobel Prize winning Daniel Kahneman explores in this book. ðŸ¤“ &nbsp;The essence of the book is focussed on analysing the differences between the two systems of the mind. System 1 requires little cognitive energy and is automatic. Whereas System 2 requires more cognitive energy. When we look at analysing our thoughts and behaviours we can derive the origins to one of these two systems. ðŸ§  &nbsp;The book goes on to talk about behavioural heuristics and biases and how and why we make choices. The book is research heavy and can be quite technical to understand when reading it. I would say for beginner readers this wouldnâ€™t be a great book to read because I found myself confused on multiple occasions whilst reading the book. Also, there were not practical frameworks that we could derive from the book. It read more like an elongated peer reviewed journal than a good storytelling narrative. It was nonetheless interesting and a lot to learn from. ðŸ“šðŸ“š &nbsp;ðŸ’¬ Let is know in the comments if you have read this and what you thought. &nbsp;https://www.ombrclub.com/</p>\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
