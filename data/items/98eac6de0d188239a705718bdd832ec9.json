  "description": "<p>Scoopy Truples from Alchemix returns to Bankless to update us on what lies ahead for the protocol, and more broadly, the DeFi ecosystem.</p> <p>Alchemix v2 is on the horizon, which will allow for much more composability and integration with the rest of DeFi, as well as introducing new means of collateral such as LUSD and MIM. Scoopy also details plans for Layer 2 and Cross-Chain launches.</p> <p>The second half of the conversation turns to DeFi 2.0, which Scoopy outlined in this epic twitter thread. This new generation of DeFi projects introduce a new primitive for bootstrapping liquidity and capital to a protocol, which traditionally has been achieved via incentivized liquidity pools.</p> <p>This new model allows protocols to purchase LP positions and accrue value more sustainably, discouraging mercenary capital that leaves when rewards taper off. Scoopy brings big ideas and digestible explanations to this complicated topic, contextualizing what may become a new era for DeFi.</p> <p>*****<br /> 📣 POOLTOGETHER | DEFI LOTTERY<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/PoolTogether\">https://bankless.cc/PoolTogether</a> <br />  *****</p> <p>🚀 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER: <a href= \"https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/\">https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/</a> <br />  🎙️ SUBSCRIBE TO PODCAST: <a href= \"http://podcast.banklesshq.com/\">http://podcast.banklesshq.com/</a> <br />  ------<br /> BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS:</p> <p>⚖️ ARBITRUM | SCALING ETHEREUM<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum\">https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum</a> </p> <p>🍵 MATCHA | DECENTRALIZED EXCHANGE AGGREGATOR<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Matcha\">https://bankless.cc/Matcha</a> </p> <p>🔐 LEDGER | SECURE YOUR ASSETS<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Ledger\">https://bankless.cc/Ledger</a> </p> <p>🧙‍♀️ ALCHEMIX | SELF-PAYING LOANS<br /> <a href= \"http://bankless.cc/Alchemix\">http://bankless.cc/Alchemix</a> </p> <p>------<br /> Topics Covered:</p> <p>0:00 Intro<br /> 3:30 Scoopy Truples & Alchemix v2<br /> 8:02 Optimizing Yield<br /> 13:03 Community & alETH Vault<br /> 21:23 Layer 2 & Cross-Chain<br /> 29:58 Governance & Participation<br /> 37:00 DeFi 2.0 and Olympus DAO<br /> 49:16 How it Works<br /> 54:39 Flushing out Toxic Liquidity<br /> 58:24 Adopting this Primitive<br /> 1:01:23 Tokemak<br /> 1:03:54 Closing & Disclaimers</p> <p>------<br /> Resources:</p> <p>Scoopy on Twitter:<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/scupytrooples?s=20\">https://twitter.com/scupytrooples?s=20</a> <br />  Scoopy’s DeFi 2.0 Thread<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/scupytrooples/status/1447398430574141445?s=20\"> https://twitter.com/scupytrooples/status/1447398430574141445?s=20</a> </p> <p>Alchemix Links:<br /> - Twitter: <a href= \"https://twitter.com/AlchemixFi?s=20\">https://twitter.com/AlchemixFi?s=20</a> <br />  - Discord: <a href= \"https://discord.com/invite/alchemix\">https://discord.com/invite/alchemix</a> <br />  - Website: <a href= \"https://alchemix.fi/\">https://alchemix.fi/</a> </p> <p>-----<br /> Not financial or tax advice.
