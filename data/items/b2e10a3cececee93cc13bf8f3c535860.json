  "description": "<p>Hinker du teh hoingy boingy! Uff da! Uff da! Tiddly winks teh dingy thingy. Don't worry - not all of today's show is in Norwegian (and neither is that gibberish). Talking about Norway's infamous export, serial killer Belle Gunness, today on the Suck. It seems as if she had begun to operate a \"murder farm\" in Laporte Indiana at the dawn of the twentieth century. We'll never know exactly how many people Belle killed, but we do know a lot about her story. Motivated by money, she sacrificed both strangers and family to accomplish her goal of becoming wealthy and lured an unknown number of men to Indiana under the false pretense of buying into her farm... and then they disappeared forever.
