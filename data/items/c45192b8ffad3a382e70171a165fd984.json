I hope you LOVE IT!\nMr. Beetle has decided to host a weekly storytime for young bugs (aided by his friend Gwen, who has agreed to operate the music player in an effort to provide the perfect soundtrack). Hosting a live storytime turns out to be slightly more complicated than Mr. Beetle imagined. How will his story end? Will it make any sense at all? And how will the young bugs (and the one terrifying mouse) respond to it? Is Mr. Beetle destined to become a legendary storyteller? You'll just have to listen and find out. \nIf you love this story, please share it with all elder beetles who are still following their dreams, any mice who cannot eat bugs due to a severe allergy, all opiniated bugs, and your friends.
