  "description": "On today's show, Nick calls in from home as he is being quarantined after contracting pink eye, the guys discuss an Australian man driving drunk and leading the police on a chase only to stop to pee on the side of the road, and chat about the growing concern that self driving cars will turn into mobile brothels. Todd wants to know what modifications the guys would make to Santa if they were in Tim Allen's shoes from the quintessential Christmas classic, The Santa Claus. The guys also play some fact or fiction, answer some listener questions including what the newspaper headline would say the morning after each member of the crew was hypothetically arrested, and close the show out with a couple vitamin thoughts. It's a fun one, come and have a good time with us.\n\nThis episode features @toddmccomas, @Digz, @nickmaraldo, @tyschmit, @BostonConnr, @VivalaZito, @evanfoxy, and @baileymccomas and closes out with a throwback Clayton Anderson banger.\n",
