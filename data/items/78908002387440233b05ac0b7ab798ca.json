  "description": "Emily instructs listeners on the hip moves to be better in bed, whether you like to shallow thrust, swivel, or screw. Instead of the old in-out, Emily offers alternative hip movements to help men and women get their pleasure groove on. As Shakira puts it, “hips don’t lie.” And we’re fairly certain Shakira is good in the sack. As the show moves along, listener’s get oral with their questions, wondering if women also do the dreaded head-push and why some men refuse to reciprocate oral sex. Also, listeners want to know if it’s normal to be attracted to older women and enjoy a Golden Shower. When it comes to sex and relationships nothing is “normal.” People just have different preferences.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
