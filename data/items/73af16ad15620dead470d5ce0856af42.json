  "description": "In June 1968, US presidential candidate Robert F Kennedy was assassinated shortly after addressing his supporters at the Ambassador Hotel in Los Angeles. It was less than five years after his older brother, President John F Kennedy, had also been assassinated. Sirhan Sirhan was convicted of the crime, but many - including Kennedy's friend Paul Schrade - suspect a second gunman was involved.  Schrade was shot himself that night and he told Rebecca Kesby about why he’s campaigning for the case to be reopened. \n\nPHOTO: Robert Kennedy speaking at the Ambassador Hotel shortly before his assassination (Getty Images)",
