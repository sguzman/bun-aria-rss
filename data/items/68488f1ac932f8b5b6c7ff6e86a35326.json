    "media:description": "What is the most natural scale? Can we transcend our cultural indoctrinations when it comes to music and try to see the mathematical essence of things? And can we also move beyond the familiar musical thought patterns that the architecture of the piano (and to a lesser extent that of the guitar) imposes on us? \n\nIf we start with an even tempered approach, then the 12 tone chromatic scale naturally emerges as the basic building block. We'll see how this gives rise to a new and more rational naming system for notes. This will have major implications for a deeper study of scales, modes and chords, attempting to move beyond our particular cultural orientations. \n\nThis is one of a series of videos on the intimate relations between mathematics and music, where I am attempting to look at the foundations of music from a more mathematical point of view. And also we will see this gives us some surprising new insights into the nature of arithmetic!\n\nI also want to introduce you to my very modest TikTok channel: \n\nwww.tiktok.com/@njwildberger\n\nwhere I am posting some on-the-spot piano improvisations, and the occasional classical piece, some of them not by J. S. Bach.\n***********************\nScreenshot PDFs for my videos are available at the website http://wildegg.com. These give you a concise overview of the contents of the lectures for various Playlists: great for review, study and summary.\n\nMy research papers can be found at my Research Gate page, at https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Norman_Wildberger\n\nMy blog is at http://njwildberger.com/, where I will discuss lots of foundational issues, along with other things.\n\nOnline courses will be developed at openlearning.com. The first one, already underway is Algebraic Calculus One at https://www.openlearning.com/courses/algebraic-calculus-one/ Please join us for an exciting new approach to one of mathematics' most important subjects!\n\nIf you would like to support these new initiatives for mathematics education and research, please consider becoming a Patron of this Channel at https://www.patreon.com/njwildberger Your support would be much appreciated! :)\n\n***********************\nHere are all the Insights into Mathematics Playlists:\n\nElementary Mathematics (K-6) Explained: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?\nlist=PL8403C2F0C89B1333\nYear 9 Maths:   https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85CcGpZpO542YLPeDIf1jqXK\nAncient Mathematics: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85Aqe2b4FBWUGJdYROT6-o4e\nWild West Banking: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85DB7CzoFWvA920NES3g8tJH\nSociology and Pure Mathematics: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85A-qCypcmZqRvaS1pGXpTua\nOld Babylonian Mathematics (with Daniel Mansfield): https://www.youtube.com/playlist?\nlist=PLIljB45xT85CdeBmQZ2QiCEnPQn5KQ6ov\nMath History: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL55C7C83781CF4316\nWild Trig: Intro to Rational Trigonometry: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3C58498718451C47\nMathFoundations: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5A714C94D40392AB\nWild Linear Algebra: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85BhzJ-oWNug1YtUjfWp1qAp\nFamous Math Problems: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85Bfc-S4WHvTIM7E-ir3nAOf\nProbability and Statistics: An Introduction: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85AMigTyprOuf__daeklnLse\nBoole's Logic and Circuit Analysis: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85CnIGIWb7tH1F_S2PyOC8rb\nUniversal Hyperbolic Geometry: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85CN9oJ4gYkuSQQhAtpIucuI\nDifferential Geometry: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85DWUiFYYGqJVtfnkUFWkKtP\nAlgebraic Topology: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6763F57A61FE6FE8\nMath Seminars: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBF39AFBBC3FB30AF\n************************\n\nAnd here are the Wild Egg Maths Playlists:\n\nTriangle Centres: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLBGXDSUohM&list=PLzdiPTrEWyz6VcJQ5xcuqY6g4DWjvpmjM\nSix: An elementary course in pure mathematics: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdiPTrEWyz4KD007Ge10dfrDVc4YwlYS\nAlgebraic Calculus One: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdiPTrEWyz4rKFN541wFKvKPSg5Ea6XB\nAlgebraic Calculus Two: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdiPTrEWyz5VLVr-0LPPgm4T1mtU_DG-\n–º",
