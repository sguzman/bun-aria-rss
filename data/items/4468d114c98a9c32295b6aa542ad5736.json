  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, what President Biden is trying to do is change the Republican Party. Democrats want a Republican Party on a leash like when former Presidents Bush and VP Dick Cheney were in office and always played along with Democrat schemes in the name of bipartisanship. They know Mitch McConnell isn't going to take on the radical left. The Democrats can't tolerate strong conservatives leading the Republican Party. So cue Hillary Clinton to run interference for damage control saying she wants to reimagine and redefine the Republican Party and a host of other things. Then, the White elitist American Marxists have institutionalized their poison across society. They have attacked the family, faith, and a colorblind society. They have embraced criminals and shunned the citizenry as crime skyrockets in Democrat-run cities across the country. Later, climate change isn't about the climate it's about control; controlling how much energy, creating scarcity, and creating the conditions for the government to step in and save the day. California is facing an energy crisis and its Governor has banned gas-powered vehicles while simultaneously asking Californians to not charge their electric cars to not strain the grid. Afterward, Herschel Walker joins the show to discuss his campaign for the US Senate. Herschel noted that Democrats accept high crime and then blame Republicans for it. He added that Georgians deserve better from their elected officials. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
