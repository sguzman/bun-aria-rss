  "description": "It’s easy to do life on our own and think we don’t need any help from others. But Joel wants to show you how you won’t reach your highest potential by yourself. God has ordained people to be in your life that will strengthen you, encourage you and push you toward your purpose.Hebrews 10:25 says, “Forsake not the assembling of yourselves together.” Together we’re better, stronger, smarter, and more powerful! Don’t waste another year doing life solo. The scripture says, when we come together in unity there is a commanded blessing. You will become everything God has created you to be when you connect with others in an atmosphere of faith.<p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
