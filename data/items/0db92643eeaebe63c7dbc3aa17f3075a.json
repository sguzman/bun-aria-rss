  "description": "<p>Testing the significance of a variable or group of variables $X$ for\npredicting a response $Y$, given additional covariates $Z$, is a ubiquitous\ntask in statistics. A simple but common approach is to specify a linear model,\nand then test whether the regression coefficient for $X$ is non-zero. However,\nwhen the model is misspecified, the test may have poor power, for example when\n$X$ is involved in complex interactions, or lead to many false rejections. In\nthis work we study the problem of testing the model-free null of conditional\nmean independence, i.e. that the conditional mean of $Y$ given $X$ and $Z$ does\nnot depend on $X$. We propose a simple and general framework that can leverage\nflexible nonparametric or machine learning methods, such as additive models or\nrandom forests, to yield both robust error control and high power. The\nprocedure involves using these methods to perform regressions, first to\nestimate a form of projection of $Y$ on $X$ and $Z$ using one half of the data,\nand then to estimate the expected conditional covariance between this\nprojection and $Y$ on the remaining half of the data. While the approach is\ngeneral, we show that a version of our procedure using spline regression\nachieves what we show is the minimax optimal rate in this nonparametric testing\nproblem. Numerical experiments demonstrate the effectiveness of our approach\nboth in terms of maintaining Type I error control, and power, compared to\nseveral existing approaches.\n</p>",
