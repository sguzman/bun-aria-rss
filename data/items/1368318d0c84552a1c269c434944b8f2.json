  "description": "<p><strong>It only took 172 episodes for this podcast to devolve into a low-budget therapy session. This week, Connor and Dan take a look at the psychoanalysis of Jacques Lacan, specifically his theory about the Mirror Phase and symbolic order of consciousness. This is some heady stuff, ladies and germs, but your hosts are trying their best. Also, Connor takes old people down a peg, we get to hear what your hosts want to be when they grow up, and they once again discuss the importance of language. Good stuff!</strong></p>",
