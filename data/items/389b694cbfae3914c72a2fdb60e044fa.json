  "description": "Happy New Year, podcast listeners! We wanted to start the year off right by encouraging you to pursue the changes and goals you’ve set! This year has so much potential for you and your organization, whether you know it or not. So, in this episode, we’re talking about how to reach your potential by avoiding the pitfalls that often come with achieving big things. <p>John Maxwell shares four key reasons people don’t reach their full potential. In light of John’s lesson, Mark Cole references our episode with Marcus Buckingham and reminds us of a misunderstanding that many people possess about potential. The truth is: Potential is not something that some people have and others don’t. There’s no such thing as high and low potential. Instead, every individual has their own unique path to growth.</p> <p>So, as we talk about potential, we’re really talking about your own unique path to growth. Keep that in mind as you listen to this episode.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this episode is the Reaching Your Potential Worksheet, which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching. You can download the worksheet by visiting MaxwellPodcast.com/Potential and clicking “Download the Bonus Resource.”</p> <p>References:</p> <p><a href= \"https://www.amazon.com/Talent-Never-Enough-Discover-Choices/dp/0785214038\"> <em>Talent Is Never Enough</em> by John C.
