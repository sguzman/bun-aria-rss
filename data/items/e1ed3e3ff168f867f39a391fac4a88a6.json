  "description": "<p>Robert Plant is arguably the most iconic rock vocalist of all time. As the frontman for Led Zeppelin, his dynamic, soaring vocal style was the perfect lead for the band’s unparalleled musicianship. After Zeppelin broke up in 1980 following the death of drummer John “Bonzo” Bonham, Plant set out on his own and recorded songs that drew inspiration from North African music, psych rock, and the Blues. </p><p>In 2007 Plant began collaborating with Alison Krauss, the famed bluegrass singer and fiddle player. Under the guidance of producer and <em>Broken Record </em>alum, T Bone Burnett, their first album, <em>Raising Sand, </em>sold over a million copies in the US and won five Grammys, including Album of the Year. </p><p>On today’s episode, Rick Rubin talks to Robert Plant about recording his latest release with Krauss, <em>Can’t Let Go</em>. Plant also talks about how a trip to the Sahara in the early ‘70s with Jimmy Paige inspired them to write “Kashmir.” And he remembers the first time he met John Bonham as a teenager and Bonham declared himself, “the best drummer in the world.”</p><p>Subscribe to Broken Record’s YouTube channel to hear all of our interviews: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast\"> https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast</a> and follow us on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrokenRecord\">@BrokenRecord</a></p><p>You can also check out past episodes here:<a href=\"https://brokenrecordpodcast.com/\"> https://brokenrecordpodcast.com</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
