  "description": "<p>The revolution is here! Atlanta has been home to many civil rights leaders and their legacy lives on in the policy and political control that Black People have in the city and county. In an effort to better educate our people about the political process AND to ask the questions to police officials about why and how they operate, Karlous Miller and DC Young Fly sit down with Fulton County Sheriff hopeful Pat Labat. Pat is the former Chief of the City of Atlanta Department of Corrections, so he knows how a part of the system works and explores the problems and what we can do to impact change. Plus, Tyler Chronicles stops through for a revolutionary conversation about community, Black history and forward progress. Tyler also breaks down what happened with Clayton English during his arrest for protesting peacefully in Los Angeles.
