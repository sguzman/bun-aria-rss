  "description": "<p>Ted Bundy is perhaps the most disturbing serial killer of the 20th century. Why? For starters, he didn’t look like a serial killer, so you can’t convince yourself you would’ve seen him coming. He was well-educated, well-liked, charismatic, and handsome. And evil to the core. And unlike most sociopathic killers, Ted knew he was evil. He described himself as the “the most cold-hearted son of a bitch you’ll ever meet,” and after listening, I think you’ll agree.</p>\n",
