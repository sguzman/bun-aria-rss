  "description": "<p>“A word after a word after a word is power.” – Margaret Atwood. Many of the great economists we have looked at in our past episodes were voracious readers, and whilst we in no way put ourselves in their company we are great believers in reading widely. Simply put&nbsp;we at EconomicsInTen are great believers in the power of reading and the power of words.&nbsp; Therefore in this sequel to the first Summer Reading special, your friendly neighbourhood economists Pete and Gav answer one simple question 10 times. What book would they recommend and why? All the books are linked to economics in some way and if you read them all, you will become a better economist and who knows, perhaps a better human being too! So while away those long summer days catching up with our podcast and reading these beauties. &nbsp; As always, this podcast comes with technical support from the great Nic and comes with music from Jukedeck – create your own at <a href=\"http://jukedeck.com/\" target=\"_blank\">jukedeck.com</a>. PS Apologies for the delay in this episodes release; we hoped to get it out at the start of summer but have been hit by \"pings\", mic problems and various other modern ills. These books will keep you going well into the Autumn!</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n",
