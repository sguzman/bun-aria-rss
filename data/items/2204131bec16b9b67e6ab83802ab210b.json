  "description": "<p>With nearly-unlimited resources for motherhood, it can be difficult to figure out what's helpful and what subtly distracts from our primary mission as moms. Even in the Christian resources, there are great nuggets of truth, stirred together with potentially dangerous theology. How can we safely get the help we need for motherhood without deviating from the path of truth? In this episode, Emily and Laura discuss the common fears and missteps moms face as they navigate resources, and offer gospel-principles for \"finding the meat and spitting out the bones\". Because ultimately, when we are familiar with biblical truth we can be wise and discerning instead of scared and gullible.</p> <p><strong>Helpful Questions for Discerning Resources:</strong></p> <ul> <li><u>Check credentials / endorsements </u></li> <li>Who is this person? Were they educated in their field, and if so, where? How are they getting their information and who else endorses it? What is their reputation?</li> <li><u>Check agenda</u></li> <li>What type of theology are they hoping the reader adopts? Is there an underlying ideology that influences their ideas?</li> <li><u>Check associations </u></li> <li>Who do they \"buddy-up\" with?
