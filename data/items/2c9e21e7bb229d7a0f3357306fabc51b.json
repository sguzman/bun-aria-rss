  "description": "The Bible speaks a lot about our words. Proverbs 18:21 says, “The tongue has the power of life and death.” And James wrote, “Look also at ships: although they are so large and are driven by fierce winds, they are turned by a very small rudder wherever the pilot desires. Even so the tongue is a little member and boasts great things” (James 3:4–5). He recognized that although our tongue is a very small part of our body, it directs the course of our life for victory or defeat even when we’re in the midst of stormy, negative situations. Too often when we get in difficult situations, we forget the power that we have in our tongue and where it can lead us.You have to be strong with your words of faith as well as being strong in your thoughts. And the best way to get your thoughts to line up is to release your words of faith. Words reinforce what you think. Make God bigger than anything else that you see.<p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
