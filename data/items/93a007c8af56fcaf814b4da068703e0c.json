  "description": "<p>In this paper, we show how different types of distributed mutual algorithms\ncan be compared in terms of performance through simulations. A simulation\napproach is presented, together with an overview of the relevant evaluation\nmetrics and statistical processing of the results. The presented simulations\ncan be used to learn students of a course on distributed software the basics of\nalgorithms for distributed mutual exclusion, together with a detailed\ncomparison study. Finally, a related work section is provided with relevant\nreferences which contain use cases where distributed mutual exclusion algorithm\ncan be beneficial.\n</p>",
