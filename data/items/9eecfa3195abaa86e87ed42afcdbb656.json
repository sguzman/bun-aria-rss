  "description": "<p>Today we welcome Whitney Goodman, the radically honest psychotherapist behind the hugely popular Instagram account Sit With Whit. She is the owner of The Collaborative Counseling Center, a private therapy practice in Miami. Whitney has her own column in Psychology Today and has been featured in The New York Times, Teen Vogue, NY Magazine, Instyle, Good Morning America, and other publications. Her most recent book is called Toxic Positivity: Keeping It Real in a World Obsessed with Being Happy.</p><p>In this episode, I talk to Whitney Goodman about toxic positivity. A happy outlook in life is a strength; but when taken too far, it can backfire and work against us. Positivity stops becoming helpful when we deny the realities of hardship and trauma. Whitney believes positivity is not the panacea to our problems—it needs to be applied in the right time, place, and purpose. She shares with us ways on how to be supportive without being dismissive of our own well-being and of others. We also touch on the topics of authenticity, gratitude, hope, relationships, and work.</p><p><strong>Website:</strong> sitwithwhit.com</p><p><strong>Instagram:</strong> @SitWithWhit</p><p> </p><p><strong>Topics</strong></p><p>03:14 When positivity becomes toxic </p><p>04:36 Pretending to be happy</p><p>08:20 Do positive people always succeed?</p><p>11:53 Changing toxic positivity</p><p>15:33 Well-being > positive thinking</p><p>21:31 Stop shaming yourself</p><p>23:19 Realistic affirmations and organic gratitude </p><p>27:11 How to complain effectively</p><p>29:15 Ingredients of communication</p><p>31:28 Discrimination with a smile</p><p>35:10 A value-driven life</p><p>40:20 It’s okay to just be</p><p>41:18 Positive fantasy can be helpful</p>\n",
