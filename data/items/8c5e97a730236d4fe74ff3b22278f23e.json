    "media:description": "In this Lambda World 2019 presentation, J Haigh discusses the Rust programming language.\n\nFull Presentation Description:\n\nFor people coming from functional languages, you may wonder when you would want to use Rust. Rust has functional patterns and takes ideas from substructural type systems. A combination of functional patterns, the borrow checker, and drop checker enable us to have nice program control flow you'd expect with a functional language and granular control of our system resources. In this talk, we'll explore how Rust empowers programmers to write logically correct and memory safe programs.\n\n------\nFollow: \n-https://www.twitter.com/lambda_world \n-https://www.twitter.com/47deg\n-https://twitter.com/DebugSteven\n\nVisit: \n-https://www.47deg.com/events for more details\n-http://www.lambda.world",
