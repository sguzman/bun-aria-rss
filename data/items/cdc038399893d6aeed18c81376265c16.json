  "description": "In this episode, I discuss the psychology and biology of desire, love and attachment. I explain how childhood attachment types are thought to inform adult attachment styles to romantic partners, and I describe some of the major theories of human mate selection, relationships and infidelity. Additionally, I explore the neurobiology and proposed subconscious processing underlying desire, love and attachment, including the roles of empathy and “positive delusion.\" I outline how self-awareness can shift one’s relationship attachment style towards securely bonded partnerships. Finally, I describe specific tools and supplements that have been researched to increase libido and sex drive. Throughout the episode, I explain the science and key mechanisms underlying romantic love and outline tools for those seeking to find a strong, healthy relationship, or for those wanting to strengthen an existing relationship. \nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Desire, Love & Attachment \n(00:02:59) Odor, Perceived Attractiveness & Birth Control\n(00:08:04) Sponsors\n(00:14:13) Romance: Balancing Love & Desire\n(00:19:00) Animal Studies, Vasopressin & Monogamy \n(00:22:06) Strange Situation Task, Childhood Attachment Styles\n(00:32:52) Adult Attachment Styles\n(00:38:50) Secure Attachment \n(00:41:23) Autonomic Arousal: The “See-Saw”\n(00:50:39) Tool: Self-Awareness, Healthy Interdependence\n(00:53:11) Neurobiology of Desire, Love & Attachment  \n(00:58:02) Empathy & Mating & the Autonomic Nervous System\n(01:10:02) Positive Delusion, Touch\n(01:15:20) Relationship Stability \n(01:21:22) Selecting Mates, Recognition of Autonomic Tone\n(01:38:28) Neural Mechanisms of Romantic Attachment \n(01:47:43) Autonomic Coordination in Relationships \n(01:56:13) Infidelity & Cheating\n(02:08:56) “Chemistry”, Subconscious Processes\n(02:12:44) Tools: Libido & Sex Drive \n(02:20:20) Maca (Maca root)  \n(02:25:58) Tongkat Ali (Longjack) \n(02:28:56) Tribulus terrestris \n(02:33:14) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube, Spotify/Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Instagram, Twitter, Supplements\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",
