  "description": "<p>This week on _ <strong>Eat Your Words</strong> _, Cathy Erway welcomes Heritage Radio Network alum, Nicole Taylor, to the show.  Talking Nicole’s brand new cookbook, “The Up South Cookbook,” it is best described as Southern cooking meets the Brooklyn foodie scene, keeping charm (and grits) intact! Georgia native Nicole spent her early twenties trying to distance herself from her southern cooking roots–a move “up” to Brooklyn gave her a fresh appreciation for the bread and biscuits, Classic Fried Chicken, Lemon Coconut Stack Cake, and other flavors of her childhood.  “The Up South Cookbook” is a bridge to the past and a door to the future. The recipes in this deeply personal cookbook offer classic Southern favorites informed and updated by newly-discovered ingredients and different cultures. The recipes speak to a place “where a story is ready to be told and there is always sweet tea chilling.”   Tune in to hear all about this new Southern classic.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://heritageradionetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/upsouthcookbook.jpg\"><img src=\"http://heritageradionetwork.org/wp-content/uploads/2015/11/upsouthcookbook-600x750.jpg\" alt=\"upsouthcookbook\" /></a></p>\n<blockquote>\n<h4>“If you can make a pot of peas I feel like you can do anything!” [25:45]</h4>\n<h4>–Nicole Taylor on Eat Your Words</h4>\n</blockquote>\n<p> </p>\n",
