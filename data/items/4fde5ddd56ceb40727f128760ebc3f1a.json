  "description": "<p>Recent temporal action segmentation approaches need frame annotations during\ntraining to be effective. These annotations are very expensive and\ntime-consuming to obtain. This limits their performances when only limited\nannotated data is available. In contrast, we can easily collect a large corpus\nof in-domain unannotated videos by scavenging through the internet. Thus, this\npaper proposes an approach for the temporal action segmentation task that can\nsimultaneously leverage knowledge from annotated and unannotated video\nsequences. Our approach uses multi-stream distillation that repeatedly refines\nand finally combines their frame predictions. Our model also predicts the\naction order, which is later used as a temporal constraint while estimating\nframes labels to counter the lack of supervision for unannotated videos. In the\nend, our evaluation of the proposed approach on two different datasets\ndemonstrates its capability to achieve comparable performance to the full\nsupervision despite limited annotation.\n</p>",
