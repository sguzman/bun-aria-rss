  "description": "<p>I am going offline for a while. I want to clear my head of all the noise and clutter that the internet has been throwing at me. It's become a net negative in my life and I want to find myself and my own thoughts again. So I'm taking a digital vacation. A detox, if you will, from all the noise. I'll be back in August but I scheduled two podcasts to go up that month so you're not completely without content. Subscribe and you'll be notified when those go live. See you around.</p>",
