  "description": "<p>Transforming Two Fears: FOF and FOMO - There are two common fears that can block us from our full potential – fear of failure (FOF), and fear of missing out (FOMO). This talk explores how to meet these fears with mindful presence, and discover within them the essence energies of loving awareness and full aliveness (a favorite from the archives).</p> <p>Note – This talk is dedicated to Tim Ferriss, who turned me on to the phrase FOMO. Tim exemplifies the creative aliveness of FOMO energy when it’s living through someone who’s dedicated to being awake, caring and real. Check out his podcasted interview with Tara at: <strong><em><a href= \"https://youtu.be/pXNEM4wjSmE\">https://youtu.be/pXNEM4wjSmE</a></em></strong> and his podcast at <strong><em><a href= \"http://fourhourworkweek.com/podcast/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">fourhourworkweek.com/podcast/.</a></em></strong></p>",
