  "description": "<p>This is our first ever listener question that we've addressed on the show - from Mark: “I was wondering about your thoughts on saving for a child’s education. My wife and I both work at colleges (she’s a professor, I’m a counselor) and we’re actually not sure what college will look like in 15 years and what the value proposition will be. Also will our kid(s) even want to go to college? We haven’t made decisions on a 529 or other account but starting to have the discussion. Thanks, fellas!” Mark is asking all the right questions and this was a great excuse for us to cover an important topic.</p><p>In this episode we cover some of the pros/cons of 529 plans, discuss how you should prioritize saving for your kid's college in relation to saving for your own retirement, cover some alternative views on college, and then we share whether or not we're planning to save for our own kid's college.</p><p>At the beginning of this episode we popped open and enjoyed a Champs de Fraises by Firestone Walker, a barrel aged wild ale fermented with strawberries, which you can learn all about on Untappd.
