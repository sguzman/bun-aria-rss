George Raveling is the mentor you wish you had.</p><p>But you can just call him&nbsp;Coach.</p><p>This week I sit down with a truly remarkable man. A 79-year old with the vibrancy and energy of a college student, I was immediately struck by George's insatiable thirst for learning. His passion&nbsp;for ideas. And his devotion to people, human potential & personal development.</p><p>Coach has lived life. And he's got stories to prove it. Inspirational stories about breaking racial barriers during the era of segregation. Instructive accounts of owning your destiny. And of course there's the legendary saga of how a young George came to stand alongside Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr. on the&nbsp;steps of the Lincoln Memorial during the March on Washington as Dr. King delivered his historic I Have A Dream&nbsp;speech.</p><p>There's so much more to this incredible story — and to George — but I'm not going to spoil it here. I'll let Coach tell it in his own words.</p><p>This is a phenomenal conversation about breaking barriers. It's about self-governance, self-belief and self-responsibility. It’s about literacy, civil rights and humanity.</p><p>And it's about the importance of being a positive difference maker in the world.</p><p>An absolute gem of a human being, George is a national treasure. I loved every second of my time with him and something tells me you will too.</p><p>So take a knee and huddle up, because Coach has a message for you.</p><p>Peace + Plants,</p><br><p><br></p><p>P.S. – As&nbsp;I only had 75 minutes with George, we barely scratched the surface on his life and wisdom. So please consider this episode a mere first installment in what I can foresee as a series of powerful exchanges. If you enjoyed this conversation, let me know what else you would like to hear from Coach by leaving your thoughts on <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/richroll\" target=\"_blank\">reddit</a> and perhaps I can cajole him to&nbsp;return for some&nbsp;pinpointed discussions on specific topics related to human potential, performance and personal development.</p><p>Listen & Subscribe on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-rich-roll-podcast/id582272991?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\">iTunes</a> | <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/richroll\" target=\"_blank\">Soundcloud</a> | <a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/30437\" target=\"_blank\">Stitcher</a> | <a href=\"https://goo.gl/app/playmusic?ibi=com.google.PlayMusic&isi=691797987&ius=googleplaymusic&link=https://play.google.com/music/m/Ik2a22yi44ypcky7h6vnjvran4e?t%3DThe_Rich_Roll_Podcast\" target=\"_blank\">GooglePlay</a></p><p>Spots are still available for our next retreat — for info visit <a href=\"http://www.plantpowerworld.com/\" target=\"_blank\">plantpowerworld.com</a></p><p>Check out Julie’s new podcast <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/divine-throughline/id1069738551?mt=2\" target=\"_blank\">divine throughline</a></p><p>Thanks to this week’s sponsors:</p><p>Harrys.com:&nbsp;A superior shave at an affordable price.&nbsp;Type in my coupon code&nbsp;“ROLL”&nbsp;at purchase for $5 off your starter set and get a...</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
