My favorite thing about the Dune series is how it points out the dramatic shifts that take place in the collected human unconscious over millennia. Like the evolution of how \"The Worm\" is viewed. In the first book the worm represents an unstoppable force of nature. The worm is Arrakis, Arrakis is the worm. It is the living and physical embodiment of the desert itself. In Freman culture the worm is God because he keeps the desert for his people. Shai Hulud guards the entrance into their \"secret realm\". The worm is exalted in Fremen society, enormous, deadly, rageful yet protective, and graceful.  All of this changes after book 4, â€œGod Emperor of Dune.\nPaul Atreides' son, Leto II, took the image of the worm and twisted it. \n\nMusic: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=jYWebrB0-iQ\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cQ5aw2UYHZY&list=OLAK5uy_kUwPnb-SfupIzp__axnJxSwh-u4je8gPA&index=3\nArt:https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ZVzlKxapEJlbVviFQ5oHBkjtTAzcEcoDrgKOFqV34Os/edit?usp=sharing\nDante/Heretics of Dune Comparison: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Hruuiw00onU&t=434s\n\nFOLLOW QUINN ON TWITTER: Twitter: https://twitter.com/IDEASOFICE_FIRE\n\nThree-Body Playlist: https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PLRXGGVBzHLUfIzEhovpQJ2ENiNvJoOD2A\nH.P.
