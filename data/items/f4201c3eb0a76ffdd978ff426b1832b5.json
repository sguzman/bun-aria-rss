  "description": "<p>I welcome back Ryan Cooper (<a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/ryanlcooper\">@ryanlcooper</a>), national correspondent for <em>The Week</em> magazine and co-host of the exciting new <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://leftanchor.podbean.com\">Left Anchor</a> podcast (you can also check them out on <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://twitter.com/leftanchor?lang=en\">Twitter</a>). Ryan wrote a <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://theweek.com/articles/856337/old-democratic-trade-paradigm-collapsing-good-riddance\">piece</a> last week (his full archive is <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://theweek.com/authors/ryan-cooper\">here</a>) looking at the alternative to the ossified “free trade” consensus that’s emerging on the left in the Democratic primary, and he’ll walk us through the development of that consensus and why it’s so ripe to be challenged now.</p><p><em>Tom Friedman and </em><em>The Mustache of Understanding</em><em> make a cameo appearance</em></p><p>Yes, I know I introduce the episode as “August 7,” but that’s because we did in fact record the interview yesterday evening. I’d hoped to send it out yesterday in fact but by the time I got done with my usual amateur efforts at cleaning it up I decided it would be better to send it out in the morning.
