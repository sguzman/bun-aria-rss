  "description": "<p>Happy New Year! Tom Segura and Christina P are back with their jeans over their heads and they recap how amazing Cobra Tate was and how broken the mommies were when they first started dating, and we open the show with Daddy Lalagone. Tom realizes he might have a food sensitivity, we analyze a new YMH employee's hair, and talk about the YMH end-of-year dinner. We talk about Mystery the Pick Up Artist and the new Netflix show \"Twentysomethings\" and how it compares to MTV's Real World back in the day. The moms saw a Charlie Brown Christmas with annoying people in the audience, watch one of the best trash talkers from one of Barstool's Rough N' Rowdy's, and we revisit the gag couple! We get into dad culture, Little Jeans' 5th birthday party, and massage chairs for Tom. We get to see FedSmoker working a case and take a look at Christina's TikTok curations.</p>\n",
