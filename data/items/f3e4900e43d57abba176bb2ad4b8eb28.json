  "content:encoded": "<p>Welcome to this festive edition of Radio Lingua News. In this update we&#8217;ll be telling you about the fantastic milestone we reached this week, and explaining how you can save 25% on our premium memberships until the end of the year.</p>\n<h3>100 million downloads</h3>\n<p>Early on Friday morning we clocked up our 100 millionth download. Over the past five years learners from around the world have downloaded our free language lessons and we&#8217;re delighted to have reached this amazing milestone. We&#8217;d like to thank all our listeners for continuing to enjoy our language lessons, and a special thank you to all our members who help to support all of our developments.</p>\n<h3>Winter sale now on</h3>\n<p>To celebrate this milestone we&#8217;ve launched our winter sale, so you can now get 25% off our memberships and premium versions of the courses. In most cases these premium versions include lesson guides in pdf or ebook format and extra audio or video content. All the courses available on our website can be purchased at this special reduced rate by using the coupon code winter2011 at checkout. The sale will continue until midnight on New Year&#8217;s Eve &#8211; or Hogmanay as we say in Scotland, so you still have almost two weeks to take advantage of these special prices, and get a head start on your language learning for 2012.</p>\n<h3>Update on current shows</h3>\n<p>The reaction to our new show for Spanish learners, Q&A Spanish, has been fantastic. We&#8217;re delighted that lots of you are now emailing us with your questions, or leaving voicemails so that we can include your questions in the show. JP and Nahyeli are enjoying answering your questions &#8211; even the difficult ones! If you&#8217;re learning Spanish and you&#8217;ve not yet listened to Q&A Spanish, you can find out more about the show, download the episodes, and find out how to contact us to ask your question at <a href=\"http://qandaspanish.com\">qandaspanish.com</a>. We&#8217;re also really pleased with On Location French, our new video blog produced by Sophie in Paris. Sophie records her regular videos with a small camera and microphone all on her own in Paris and although we had some teething problems with sound, things are settling down now. She&#8217;s been including some really interesting phrases &#8211; and this week&#8217;s expression is a fantastic construction to add to your vocabulary! You can access On Location French on iTunes, Blip.TV or of course at <a href=\"https://radiolingua.com/shows/french/on-location-french/\">onlocationfrench.com</a>. Turning to our other courses, although we&#8217;ve had a delay with our new One Minute Languages series, we&#8217;re getting back on track and there will be new episodes out this week of our Dutch, Flemish and Arabic courses. As far as Coffee Break French is concerned, we&#8217;re now into the final eight lessons of Season 3 and in these episodes we&#8217;ll be going back through the texts used in this season and picking out some of the most important grammar points, then helping learners practise these constructions with a series of translation and dictation exercises. There will be lots of extra members-only content, so with our winter sale currently on, perhaps now is the time to take advantage of our special pricing.</p>\n<h3>Happy holidays!</h3>\n<p>Finally, we&#8217;d like to wish you all a very happy holiday season and hope that you get the chance to relax, spend time with your friends and family, enjoying everything that the festive season brings, and get the chance to work on your language &#8211; or put it into practice if you happen to be travelling! Don&#8217;t forget that you can join us in our <a href=\"https://radiolingua.com/shows/festive-phrases-advent-calendar/\">Festive Phrases video series</a> each day of December until the 25th to learn a festive greeting in a different language. Use the link on the home page of the Radio Lingua site to open each day of our linguistic Advent Calendar. Until the next time, happy holidays from everyone here at Radio Lingua!</p>\n",
