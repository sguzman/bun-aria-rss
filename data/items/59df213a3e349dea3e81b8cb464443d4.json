  "description": "<p>It's good to be back in studio with your Bestie and see your other Bestie on a larger screen. Today is Nikki Glaser Day in STL and hopefully critics will see Nikki is more than \"back alley humor\". Nikki and Andrew are inspired to talk about the effect of comedy as Nikki is on a George Carlin kick. Andrew thinks his cat hates him because he is not as flexible as his girlfriend. Nikki has an odd timed appearance schedule and looks forward to being on Watch What Happens Live! w/ Andy Cohen tonight. You Heard it Here First; a crime solving duck, a debate on cheating and a silly brawl in sports. Nikki doesn't care too much about throwing the first pitch at the Cardinals game this evening but she does care about giving advice to Besties on Fanthrax!</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
