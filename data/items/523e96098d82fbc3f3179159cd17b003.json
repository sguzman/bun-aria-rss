  "description": "<p>In this 123rd in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens.</p><p> </p><p>This week, we discuss Elon Musk’s twitter play, and the implications for censorship, and the new public square. We discuss the modern impulse to make binaries of things that aren’t (e.g. political opinions), and to reject binaries that are real (e.g. sex). We talk about puberty blockers, and their non-reversibility, and whether “gender identity” is a real thing. And we discuss great evolutionary theorist W.D. Hamilton who, in the late 1990s, warned of the coming “hospitalization” of humans—an observation well worth considering in the Age of Covid.</p><p> </p><p>*****</p><p> </p><p>Support the sponsors of the show:</p><p> </p><p>ReliefBand: Get relief from nausea without drugs.
