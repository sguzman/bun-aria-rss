  "description": "Specialist Vanessa Guillen went missing from Fort Hood Military Base on April 22, 2020. She was last seen at the armory and the last person she was seen working alongside was fellow soldier and specialist Aaron Robinson. Weeks before her disappearance, she told those closest to her that she had been dealing with a fellow soldier, a sergeant, that was sexually harassing her and she was ready to report it. <br>\n<br>\nJune 30, her dismembered, burned and mutilated remains were found crudely buried in quick cement/earth alongside the Leon River in Belton Texas. Robinson took his own life in an attempt to escape his crime but his girlfriend Cecily Aguilar confessed to her part in the brutal mutilation and disposal of the body of a US soldier. Details of the crime and the following weeks are confusing and suspicious. Is there a coverup? Regardless of the truth, this brings to light the broader issue of reporting sexual assault in the military and Vanessa's family is trying to make sure those that defend our country are safe to report these issues without fear of repercussions.<br>\n<br>\nSee soldier's speaking out:<br>\n#IamVanessaGuillen<br>\n<br>\nThanks to our sponsors!<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Prose<br>\n</strong>Prose is the healthy hair regimen with your name all over it.
