  "description": "<p>The United States of America has 5% of the world’s population and 25% of the world's prison population. There are over 2 million prisoners in America which is more than any country in recorded history. America’s prison system is a multi-billion dollar industry. The prison economy has a far-reaching grip that employs thousands, encompasses Fortune 500 companies, and crosses political lines. For over a year we have wanted to do an episode on the business of prison and the criminal justice system. We had to wait for the right time and the right guest. Fortunately, we were able to finally make it happen. Mysonne as the perfect guest for this conversation. At the prime of his budding rap career, he was sentenced to 7 years in prison for allegedly stealing $10 from a cab driver (a crime that he has maintained innocence). After coming home, he has transformed into a voice of change for criminal justice reform and has become a voice for the voiceless that are incarcerated. In episode 81, we cover the prison economy, talk about criminal justice reform, and explain how the criminal justice system affects everyone either directly or indirectly. #mysonne Guest IG: @mysonnenygeneral EYL University: https://www.eyluniversity.com Code for 40% annual discount: Earners EYL Website: https://www.earnyourleisure.com/ --- This episode is sponsored by · Anchor: The easiest way to make a podcast. <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/app\">https://anchor.fm/app</a> Support this podcast: <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/earnyourleisure/support\">https://anchor.fm/earnyourleisure/support</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
