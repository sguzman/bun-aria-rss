  "description": "<p>Dear Readers... it's us. Hi. We're the problem, it's us. But there really ain't no problem here, because today Matt & Bow offer up the Midnights episode of Las Cultch. Call it a review. Call it a track-by-track dissection. Call it what you WANT... to. Much to discuss! Has Taylor or Tayla taken over this time, or is this a new TS musical persona entirely? What, exactly, is the distinction between midnight and 3 AM? Is it just us or is there a lot of LAs Cultch on this album?! Is this a fuck album? So many questions! It's what you've been waiting for... and no we didn't forget about Carly Rae! Listen now! Meet us at midnight (or whatever time it is where you're at).</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
