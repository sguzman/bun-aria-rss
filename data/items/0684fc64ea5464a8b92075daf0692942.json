  "description": "<p>Over the course of her impressive career, Julianna Margulies has starred on some wildly popular television shows. She played Nurse Carol Haloway on the definitive medica drama, ER. She starred as the disgraced politician’s wife, Alicia Florrick, in The Good Wife. And coming this September she’ll be joining the stellar cast of “The Morning Show.” The award-winning actress, and producer, is going behind the scenes of some of those shows and taking a look at the impact of her nomadic childhood and upbringing in her memoir: “Sunshine Girl: An unexpected life.” On this episode of Next Question with Katie Couric, Katie and Julianna dive into all of that — Julianna’s cross-continental childhood, her complicated hippie mom, the backlash she experienced leaving ER (and turning down a $27 million contract), why she just couldn’t shake Alicia Florrick and so much more.
