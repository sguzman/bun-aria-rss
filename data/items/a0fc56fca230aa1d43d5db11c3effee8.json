Among other areas, there were great changes in Minoan Crete, Egypt, the Hittite Empire, Mycenaean Greece and Syria. The reasons for the changes, and the extent of those changes, are open to debate and include droughts, rebellions, the breakdown of trade as copper became less desirable, earthquakes, invasions, volcanoes and the mysterious Sea Peoples. \n\nWith \n\nJohn Bennet\nDirector of the British School at Athens and Professor of Aegean Archaeology at the University of Sheffield\n\nLinda Hulin\nFellow of Harris Manchester College and Research Officer at the Oxford Centre for Maritime Archaeology at the University of Oxford\n\nAnd\n\nSimon Stoddart\nFellow of Magdalene College and Reader in Prehistory at the University of Cambridge \n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson.",
