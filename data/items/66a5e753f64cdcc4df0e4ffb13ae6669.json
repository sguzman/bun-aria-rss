  "itunes:summary": "The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 64 \n\nMost people think of Marxism as an economic theory or, perhaps, a social theory. This isn't sufficient. Marxism, strange as it may sound, is a theology, the basis for a religion. This isn't to say that Marxism or Communism is like a religion. It is to say that it literally is a religion. The basis of the Marxian theology is work, or, as they tend to have it, the work. You must do the work. The work is the basis of the Marxian theology in the same way that submission is the basis of Islam and atonement by grace through the sacrifice of Jesus as Christ is the basis of Christianity. In this groundbreaking episode of the New Discourses Podcast, James Lindsay dives into the Marxian literature, including the writings of Karl Marx himself, to show that Marxism should be thought of as a theology by clarifying how this theology works. Understanding the theological nature of Marxism will, in turn, shed considerable light on the theological nature of Wokeness. Join James for this intense, in-depth discussion.\n\nSupport New Discourses:\npaypal.me/newdiscourses\nnewdiscourses.locals.com/support\npatreon.com/newdiscourses\nsubscribestar.com/newdiscourses\nyoutube.com/channel/UC9K5PLkj0N_b9JTPdSRwPkg/join\n\nWebsite:\nhttps://newdiscourses.com\n\nFollow:\nfacebook.com/newdiscourses\ntwitter.com/NewDiscourses\ninstagram.com/newdiscourses\nhttps://newdiscourses.locals.com\npinterest.com/newdiscourses\nlinkedin.com/company/newdiscourses\nminds.com/newdiscourses\nreddit.com/r/NewDiscourses\n\nPodcast:\n@newdiscourses\npodcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/new-…es/id1499880546\nbit.ly/NDGooglePodcasts\nopen.spotify.com/show/0HfzDaXI5L4LnJQStFWgZp\nstitcher.com/podcast/new-discourses\n\n© 2022 New Discourses.
