  "description": "We are joined by James Early, the co-host of some of the best series on this show, including our Key Battles Series (World War One, the Civl War, the Revolutionary War) and Presidential Fight Club. James is here to discuss the War of 1812, a little war with a big impact. Although it was a sideshow for the British (that cared more about the Napoleonic Wars, which threatened its existence) and to the lesser extent the Americans (that couldn’t bother to field a standing army up to the war), the War of 1812 forged post-Revolutionary American identity. It gave the United States a new boost of confidence, shored up its military power, and kick off the age of expansion that continued for the next century.<br />Check out more of James’s content on his Key Battles of American History Podcast.",
