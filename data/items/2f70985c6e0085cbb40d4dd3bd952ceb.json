  "description": "This week we were pleased to speak with Sara Barney—founder and principal designer of the Austin-based firm BANDD DESIGN. Sara is an Austin native who spent the first 10 years of her career in California in the sports and entertainment industries. Now back on her home turf, she’s taking the design world by storm. Sara was named one of Fortune Magazine‘s Most Powerful Women, one of Austin Monthly‘s Women to Watch, and is a member of the American Society of Interior Designers and the Female Founder Collective.\n\n\nWhat You’ll Hear on This Episode:\n\nMuch of Sara’s style draws from her varied professional background and from living in California.\n\nSara decided shortly after having her 2 daughters that she wanted to switch careers and try her hand at design. She took a 1 year online program and her business was booming before she even finished.\n\nWe talk about Sara’s approach to styling shelves and her love/hate relationship with floating shelves.\n\nSolids work well for large elements and Sara ties in textures, layers and patterns with smaller pieces.\n\nSara loves taking risks with wallpaper and shares some of her favorite sources.\n\nThe all-white kitchen is a big trend, but Sara prefers playing with colors in the kitchen.\n\nSara works a lot with young families and gives tips on where she recommends investing in more sturdy, stain-resistant pieces.\n\n3D printed houses are here; and Sara explains how it works and how she got to design one.\n\nWhat are two of the things everyone is asking Sara for? (matte black fixtures and modern farmhouse)\n\nWith people spending more time at home due to COVID, Sara talks about how design requests have been influenced.\n\nSara talks about best home office solutions and how to make the space not look so “corporate”.\n\nWe talk about Sara’s love of and use of deep teal and integrating functional items to fit within the design.\n\nWhy one of Sara’s phrases is, “No Schluter ever!”",
