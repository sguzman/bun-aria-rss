  "description": "The predictions from a few years ago that the so-called \"gig economy\" would take over the country are looking a little shakier now. That's because California and other states have enacted laws that force many gig apps to classify their users as employees.\nOn this episode of On The Merits, Bloomberg Law's Maeve Allsup talks about how, despite a pro-gig economy ballot initiative last year, many of these apps are still subject to California's employment laws. (3:10)\nAlso, we take a look at the ongoing trial of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin, who is charged with the murder of George Floyd. Kristen Gibbons Feden, a former Pennsylvania assistant district attorney who tried and convicted Bill Cosby, talks to us about how to prosecute a trial that's receiving intense media attention.
