  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today we have a wonderful guest, Liz Kennedy. You’ve probably heard of her. She is a TV host and On-Air Beauty Expert. She’s been on shows like Steve Harvey, Dr. Phil, QVC and Access Hollywood. She’s also an entrepreneur and she’s recently launched the Beauty Magnet which we’re going to get all the information about because being that she is a trained esthetician, she made sure she was going to make a tool that would be perfect for all of us.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We also get into some real talk because as she’s also really big on social media, she is really walking the walk, and talking the talk. She wants to be real with her audience because the things that you go through are the same things that affect her. And all of that has to do with our beauty, both inside and out.</span></p>",
