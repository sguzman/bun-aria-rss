She said it's just harder to stay on plan and falls into telling herself she can eat something crappy \"just this once.\"</p> <p>There are a couple of reasons this comes up. You can be just physically tired. When you're physically tired, your thoughts may be like \"hey we should eat to keep up our energy!\"</p> <p>You could also be emotionally tired and just need a break. We live in an over-stimulating world and sometimes you just have to shut down for a bit.</p> <p>In this podcast we help you identify which one it is for you, how it shows up, and what to do with it to prevent eating when you just don't need to.</p> <p> </p>",
