  "description": "<p>Roberty \"Bobby\" Kelly had me over to the YKWD studios to record an album commentary episode of Skeptic Tank on his first comedy album, Robert Kelly Live. On these episodes I break down a comic's (usually) first album and we discuss all the things that went into making all the jokes, recording the album, how their styles have changed, what inspired the bits, and all sorts of stuff from an academic point of view on comedy. </p> <p>We did this to help promote Robert's set on season 2 of The Degenerates on Netflix. So make sure to open up Netflix and watch Bobby's set on there.</p> <p> </p> <p>My final dates for Ari Shaffir: Jew  are:</p> <p>Oahu - Jan 15</p> <p>Maui - Jan 17</p> <p>Kauai - Jan 19</p> <p>Portland - Jan 23</p> <p>Pittsburgh - Jan 25</p> <p>Charlotte - Jan 26</p> <p>New York - Feb 7 and 8</p> <p>Tickets are at http://www.arishaffir.com/tour</p>",
