  "description": "<p>Many people mistakenly refer to the Homestead Sanatorium as an asylum, but it was never an asylum. Although abandoned and derelict, the building still stands grandiose and beautiful and it would be a shame to see it torn down. The benefactor of the property, Horace Carpentier would not want to see that happen either. For decades, those with TB called Homestead home and many of them died here. Is that why the place is rumored to be haunted? Or is it just because it is a large abandoned building with a history? Join us as we look at the history and hauntings of the Saratoga County Homestead Sanatorium. The Moment in Oddity features an underwater fake skeleton tea party and This Day in History features the Christmas Seals.</p> <p>Picture courtesy of:  Diane D'Alessandro</p> <p>Check out the website:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/12/hgb-podcast-ep-88-homestead-sanatorium.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/12/hgb-podcast-ep-88-homestead-sanatorium.html</a></p> <p>Become and Executive Producer:  <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p> </p>",
