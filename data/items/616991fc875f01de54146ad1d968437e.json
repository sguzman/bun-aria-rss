Trump has also collected a number of endorsements from professional athletes and coaches, so the NPR Politics team invited Washington Post sports columnist Kevin Blackistone on the podcast to talk about what happens when sports and politics collide, why athletes endorse, and what it means for the race. This episode: campaign reporter Scott Detrow, political editor Domenico Montanaro, and special correspondent Melissa Block.
