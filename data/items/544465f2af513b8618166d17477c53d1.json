  "description": "It's obvious on even a cursory listen to Chris Taylor's new project CANT that he's taken advantage of his time off from Grizzly Bear. \"Ghost,\" his first release in this incarnation, came hot off the heels of Grizzly Bear's critically adoredVeckatimest (an album he produced), and it sounded like it. On the recent Dreams Come True, however, the stylistic markers of Grizzly Bear are conspicuously absent. Gone are the tone cluster vocal harmonies and heavily reverbed guitar. The crunchy fuzz bass of \"Believe\" plays more like a brilliant cover of a lost '80s R&B ballad, while \"Answer\" is a glitchy Goth new-wave slog and \"Be Around\" would feel at home under an action-movie montage. They comprise a dazzling alternative universe from an already accomplished artist. Hear CANT in a full concert, recorded live on October 29, 2011 at Moogfest in Asheville, N.C.",
