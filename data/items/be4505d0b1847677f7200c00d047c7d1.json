My sleep broke on a hug,\n        Suddenly, from behind,\nIn which the full lengths of our bodies pressed:\n         Your instep to my heel,\n     My shoulder-blades against your chest.\n     It was not sex, but I could feel\n     The whole strength of your body set,\n             Or braced, to mine,\n         And locking me to you\n     As if we were still twenty-two\n     When our grand passion had not yet\n         Become familial.\n     My quick sleep had deleted all\n     Of intervening time and place.\n         I only knew\nThe stay of your secure firm dry embrace.\n​\n​\n​\nThom Gunn, \"The Hug\" from The Man with Night Sweats.
