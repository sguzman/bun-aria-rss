    "media:description": "In this video we look at the entire timeline of Squidward Tentacles from SpongeBob SquarePants. Voiced by Rodger Bumpass, we look at Squidward's history, his past and future. Taking a look at the full SpongeBob SquarePants episodes, I've put Squidward's life in chronological order. From season 1 to newest SpongeBob SquarePants season. I talk about how Squidward met Spongebob and Patrick, Spongebob's house and discuss the spin-off show Kamp Koral and the SpongeBob movies.\n\nWe also look at the funniest SpongeBob SquarePants moments from Patrick, Squidward, Mr Krabs, Plankton and Mrs Puff. As well as other SpongeBob SquarePants characters from Bikini Bottom.\n\nSpecial thanks to @PhantomStrider \n\n#spongebob   #timeline  #spongebobsquarepants #Squidward\n\n\nCopyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for \"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
