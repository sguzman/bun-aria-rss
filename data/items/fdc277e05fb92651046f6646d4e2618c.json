  "description": "Munya Chawawa is the comedian who repeatedly went viral during the pandemic thanks to his hilarious social media videos. His parody of the Shaggy song, It Wasn’t Me, in which he satirised the former health secretary Matt Hancock’s extra-marital dalliance, has been viewed over a million times on YouTube. He's also a presenter on the Channel 4 show Complaints Welcome and was nominated for a 2021 MOBO Award for Best Media Personality.<br /><br />Munya joins me to talk about Zimbabwean discipline, the art of satire and dressing up as a urine sample (yes, you did read that correctly). We also talk about his A-Level failure and that one time he accidentally sent a nude he really regrets.<br /><br />Prepare to laugh until your belly aches.<br /><br />---<br /><br />How To Fail With Elizabeth Day is hosted by Elizabeth Day, produced by Naomi Mantin and Chris Sharp.
