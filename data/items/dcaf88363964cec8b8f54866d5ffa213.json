  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, the leadership of the Democrat party that supported the Klan, did nothing to stop lynching and created Jim Crow laws came together to disrespect the citizens and reject the Constitution on January 6. They disgustingly compared the Capitol riot to Pearl Harbor and the 9/11 attacks. Sadly, what we're seeing with the press is party journalism. A media that is focused on advancing their political agenda instead of reporting the facts. They've made it their mission to destroy Donald Trump and everything related to him because he represents the hard-working people of this great country. The Marxist revolution is devouring every aspect of our culture and they don't care who they dispirit or what they destroy in the process. Then, no members of Congress were hurt in the capitol riot, yet the media seems to omit that as they chant in unison on a purported attack on democracy. In his speech, President Biden said, that his critics only \"obey the law when it's convenient\" forgetting that he stood quiet during the George Floyd riots and destruction of 2020. Later, thanks to the Democrats' pro-crime policies crime waves continue growing in cities across America. Homicides rates are equally increasing as murders skyrocket, yet there isn't a day of remembrance for the people, many of them minorities of color, that are dying in these Democrat-run cities. Finally, Author Mollie Hemingway joins the show to discuss how the media avoids their accountability on January 6.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
