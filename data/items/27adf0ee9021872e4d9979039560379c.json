Their story begins a century ago when Jay’s grandfather founded the business after witnessing one of the earliest commercial lighting expositions.

And now Skylar’s startup sensibilities are coming to the fore. On this episode of the podcast, host<strong> Dennis Scully</strong> spoke with Jay and Schuylar about the moves that put their company on the map, how they got smart about designer collaborations, and what it means to lead a century old company into the next 100 years.   </p><p>This podcast is sponsored by <a href=\"www.onsidedoor.com\">SideDoor</a> and <a href=\"www.mooreandgiles.com\">Moore & Giles</a></p><p><i><strong>LINKS</strong></i><br /><a href=\"https://boydlighting.com/\">Boyd Lighting</a><br /><a href=\"www.instagram.com/dennisscully\">Dennis Scully</a><br /><a href=\"www.businessofhome.com\">Business of Home</a></p>\n",
