  "description": "<p>A room filled with some heroes - Dan Hanzus, Marc Sessler and Gregg Rosenthal preview all the games on the Week 8 slate, starting with the primetime matchups: Packers at Bills on Sunday night (4:19), Bengals at Browns on Monday night (11:22), and Broncos \"at\" Jaguars in London early Sunday morning (18:19). Then, we begin the draft with the only Week 8 matchup between two winning teams: Giants at Seahawks (27:30) before previewing the rest of the games: 49ers at Rams (35:21), Cardinals at Vikings (42:04), Patriots at Jets (48:52), Steelers at Eagles (57:11), Raiders at Saints (1:02:54), Dolphins at Lions (1:07:48), Panthers at Falcons (1:13:48), Titans at Texans (1:17:50), Bears at Cowboys (1:24:27), and finally, Commanders at Colts (1:29:40). Each of the heroes makes their lock-of-the-week pick, and the Cincinnati Zoo returns again.</p>\n<p>Note: timecodes approximate.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
