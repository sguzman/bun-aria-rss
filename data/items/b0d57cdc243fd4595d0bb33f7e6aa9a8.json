  "description": "<p>Today, we’re launching a new series called Growth and Gratitude! In this series, John adapts six laws from <em>The Laws of Lifetime Growth</em> by Dan Sullivan and Catherine Nomura to his own principles for growth. These laws are like mirrors––tools that allow you to reflect on your behavior and determine if you’re supporting or undermining your personal growth.</p> <p>If you’re looking toward the future with apprehension, this lesson will help you begin to look forward with anticipation. Next week, we’ll continue the series by discussing gratitude.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this series is the Growth and Gratitude Worksheet, which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching. You can download the worksheet by visiting MaxwellPodcast.com/growth and clicking “Download the Bonus Resource.”</p> <p>References:</p> <p><em><a href= \"https://www.amazon.com/Laws-Lifetime-Growth-Always-Future/dp/1626566453/ref=tmm_pap_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=\"> The Laws of Lifetime Growth by Dan Sullivan and Catherine Nomura</a></em></p> <p><em><a href= \"https://store.johnmaxwell.com/25-Ways-to-Win-With-People_p_689.html\"> 25 Ways to Win with People by John C.
