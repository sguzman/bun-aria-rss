  "description": "<p>We investigate how basic probability inequalities can be extended to an\nimprecise framework, where (precise) probabilities and expectations are\nreplaced by imprecise probabilities and lower/upper previsions. We focus on\ninequalities giving information on a single bounded random variable $X$,\nconsidering either convex/concave functions of $X$ (Jensen's inequalities) or\none-sided bounds such as $(X\\geq c)$ or $(X\\leq c)$ (Markov's and Cantelli's\ninequalities). As for the consistency of the relevant imprecise uncertainty\nmeasures, our analysis considers coherence as well as weaker requirements,\nnotably $2$-coherence, which proves to be often sufficient. Jensen-like\ninequalities are introduced, as well as a generalisation of a recent\nimprovement to Jensen's inequality. Some of their applications are proposed:\nextensions of Lyapunov's inequality and inferential problems. After discussing\nupper and lower Markov's inequalities, Cantelli-like inequalities are proven\nwith different degrees of consistency for the related lower/upper previsions.\nIn the case of coherent imprecise previsions, the corresponding Cantelli's\ninequalities make use of Walley's lower and upper variances, generally ensuring\nbetter bounds.\n</p>",
