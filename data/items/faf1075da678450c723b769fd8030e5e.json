  "description": "<p>Nikola Tesla. The prototypical \"mad scientist\". He slept only a few hours a night and devoted his life to science like none-other. A rags-to-riches-to-rags visionary who was a giant in the field of scientific invention, he created the first alternating current (AC) motor and was a pioneer in the field of wireless information transmission. He helped build the world’s first large-scale hydroelectric power plant at Niagara Falls. He even pushed scientific rival Thomas Edison into electrocuting pets to prove that his direct current technology was better and safer than Tesla’s alternating current. It was a AC versus DC, War of Currents nerd fight that lasted over a decade. He was also a strange man who fell in love with a pigeon and once claimed to have created a \"death ray\".
