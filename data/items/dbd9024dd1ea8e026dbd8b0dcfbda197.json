It is a classic case of efficacy, but without safety in the setting of weight loss. This setting of weight loss can be prone to chemical misuse, further exacerbating understanding in human systems. Christopher is one of 2 - 3 cases documented in literature to have survived an accident with DNP for weight loss. As of 2021, one organization has permission from the US FDA to investigate DNP in some neurodegenerative disorders. These are rare diseases with limited standards of care, therefore extenuating circumstances to find anything that could potentially improve patient outcomes.\n\nTweet me: https://www.twitter.com/hemereview\nIG me: https://www.instagram.com/hemereview\nFB me: https://www.facebook.com/hemereview\n\nReferences: \n\nRole of dantrolene in dinitrophenol (DNP) : A continuing question?
