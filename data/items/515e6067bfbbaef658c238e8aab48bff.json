For some reason, the security guard gets it in his head that OP is a hospital employee and is parking in an area where hospital employees can't park. The guard takes extreme steps to try to thwart OP, including chaining a cinder block to OP's car to prevent her from leaving. OP just picks up the cinder block, puts it in her car, and drives off, LOL!</p>\n",
