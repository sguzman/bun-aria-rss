  "title": "Farmer Jamila Norman Of “Homegrown,” The New Show From The Magnolia Network",
  "description": "Being on TV was never a goal for Jamila Norman, aka Farmer J. As the founder of Patchwork City Farms in Atlanta, she was looking to connect with the land and provide produce for her family and local residents. But now a decade later, she’s the star of 'Homegrown,' a brand new show from Joanna and Chip Gaines’ Magnolia Network. In each episode, Jamila helps families transform their outdoor spaces and grow their own food, and she’s thrilled to have a larger platform where she can spread the word about farming. “I couldn’t have written this journey at all,” Jamila told Radio Cherry Bombe host Kerry Diamond. “I’m excited to have the opportunity to live it.” Tune in for their conversation about 'Homegrown,' what Jamila is harvesting and loving this summer, the impact of climate change on small farmers, and more. \nThank you to Free People for supporting this episode! \nRadio Cherry Bombe is recorded at Newsstand Studios at Rockefeller Center in New York City. \nOur theme song is by Tra La La. \n",
