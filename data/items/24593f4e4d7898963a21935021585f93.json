These addictive, nutrient-depleted foods not only make us obese and sick but drive us to consume more and more “food-like substances,” looking for the missing nutrients. Yet, a desire for real food is a fundamental part of our basic biological blueprint. Given the chance, our taste receptors will naturally gravitate toward the inherent goodness found in real, whole foods.</p><br><p>In this mini-episode, Dr. Hyman speaks to Dr. Elizabeth Boham, Dave Asprey, Fred Provenza, and Dr. Assem Malhotra about how our taste buds, hormones, and brain chemistry have been hijacked by the food industry. They discuss how ultra-processed foods are leading us to be overfed, yet undernourished and how we can reclaim our nutritional wisdom by eliminating ultra-processed foods from our diet.</p><br><p>Elizabeth Boham is a physician and nutritionist who practices Functional Medicine at The UltraWellness Center in Lenox, MA. Through her practice and lecturing she has helped thousands of people achieve their goals of optimum health and wellness. She witnesses the power of nutrition every day in her practice and is committed to training other physicians to utilize nutrition in healing. Dr. Boham has contributed to many articles and wrote the latest chapter on Obesity for the <em>Rankel Textbook of Family Medicine</em>. She is part of the faculty of the Institute for Functional Medicine and has been featured on the <em>Dr. Oz</em> show and in a variety of publications and media including <em>Huffington Post, The Chalkboard Magazine, and Experience Life</em>. Her DVD <em>Breast Wellness: Tools to Prevent and Heal from Breast Cancer </em>explores the Functional Medicine approach to keeping your breasts and whole body well.</p><br><p>Dave Asprey is the founder and Chairman of Bulletproof 360, a high-performance coffee and food company, and creator of the widely-popular Bulletproof Coffee. He is a <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author, host of the Webby award-winning podcast <em>Bulletproof Radio</em>, and has been featured on the <em>Today</em> show, Fox News, <em>Nightline</em>, CNN, and dozens more. Over the last two decades Dave, the “Father of Biohacking”, has worked with world-renowned doctors, researchers, scientists, and global mavericks to uncover the latest, most innovative methods, techniques, and products for enhancing mental and physical performance.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Fred Provenza grew up in Salida, Colorado, working on a ranch and attending school in Wildlife Biology at Colorado State University. He is professor emeritus of Behavioral Ecology in the Department of Wildland Resources at Utah State University where he worked for 35 years, directing an award-winning research group that pioneered an understanding of how learning influences foraging behavior and how behavior links soil, plants, herbivores, and humans. He is the author of three books, including <em>Nourishment: What Animals Can Teach Us About Rediscovering Our Nutritional Wisdom; Foraging Behavior: Managing to Survive in a World of Change</em>; and <em>The Art & Science of Shepherding: Tapping the Wisdom of French Herders</em> (co-written with Michel Meuret). He has published over 300 research papers in a wide variety of scientific journals.&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Aseem Malhotra is a founding member of Action on Sugar and was the lead campaigner highlighting the harm caused by excess sugar consumption in the United Kingdom, particularly its role in type 2 diabetes and obesity. In 2015, he coordinated the Choosing Wisely campaign by the Academy of Medical Royal Colleges as lead author in a <em>BMJ </em>paper to highlight the risks of overuse of medical treatments. In the same year, he became the youngest member to be appointed to the board of trustees of UK health think tank, The King’s Fund, that advises the government on health policy. His first book, co-authored with Donal O’ Neill, <em>The Pioppi Diet</em>, has become an international bestseller.</p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by Even.
