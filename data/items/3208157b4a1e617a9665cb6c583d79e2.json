  "description": "The Vergecast three-piece is back together, with Nilay leading the flagship podcast. The biggest news this week is something we’ve seen coming for a while: on Thursday, the FCC voted to repeal net neutrality rules. Nilay, Dieter, and Paul sit down to discuss the action and their viewpoints on what this means going forward for the internet. \n\nAlso, the iMac Pro is now available to order and Dieter got to write about it. There’s quite a bit of talk about whether this computer is worth the price for its power. \n\nThere’s a lot more in between that — like Paul’s weekly segment “The internet of claps” — so listen to the whole episode to get everything to need to know in the world of tech this week. \n\n02:10 - The FCC just killed net neutrality\n\n 41:53 - The iMac Pro is a beast, but it’s not for everybody\n\n57:23 - What is Layer3 TV and why is T-Mobile buying it?\n\n1:04:16 - Paul’s weekly segment “The internet of claps”\n\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
