  "description": "This month on Outward, hosts Christina Cauterucci, Bryan Lowder, and New America’s Brandon Tensley explore the meaning of family. How do gay people form their own families and create spaces from those bonds of kinship? First they play a game with Slate’s June Thomas, deciding whether fictional characters are members of the queer clan; then they each discuss the types of families they’ve created. They get a call from Lillian Faderman and her wife Phyllis Irwin about the legal journey of their relationship since the 1980s, and then Slate’s Mark Joseph Stern joins the hosts to talk about the different legal options LGBTQ people have to build families together.\nThis podcast was produced by Daniel Schroeder.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
