  "description": "<p>This week on a spirited episode of Watch What Crappens, Ronnie Karam (TVgasm.com), Matt Whitefield (Yahoo!) and Ben Mandelker (bsideblog.com) tackle an important issue for this country:  bullying.  Or as Alexis Bellino calls it, BOOLYING.  The guys fiercely debate whether or not Alexis was in fact bullied by the other women on The Real Housewives of Orange County.  Then it's on to Married To Medicine to discuss two seminal Atlanta events:  The Spooky Ooky Halloween Party and Pups In Paris.  It's Mariah vs. Toya, and the guys have plenty of opinions about both.  Finally, things close out with lost footage from The Real Housewives of Atlanta, and as always there's tons of gossip and bizarre references throughout.  Definitely check this episode out!<br />\n<br /><hr /><p>See <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://acast.com/privacy\">acast.com/privacy</a> for privacy and opt-out information.</p><p><a href=\"https://patreon.com/watchwhatcrappens\">Our Patreon Extras: https://patreon.com/watchwhatcrappens</a></p></p>\n",
