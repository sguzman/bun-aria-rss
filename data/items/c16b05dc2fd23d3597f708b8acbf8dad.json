  "description": "In this message, Victoria will encourage you to say yes to God. Second Corinthians 1:20 says, “For as many as are the promises of God, in Christ they are [all answered] ‘Yes.’ So through Him we say our ‘Amen’ to the glory of God.” What is it that you need to say yes to today? Is it, “Yes, God, I’m going to forgive those people who hurt me”? Is it, “Yes, I’m going to believe that You can bring good out of this difficult time and show me Your favor”? Maybe it’s, “Yes, God, I’m going to reach out to those people whom You’re asking me to reach out to even though I don’t feel like I have time”?
