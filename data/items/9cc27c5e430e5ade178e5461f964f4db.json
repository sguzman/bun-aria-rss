  "description": "<p>Link to Trapper University: https://www.thetrapperuniversity.com/?affcode=348432_5wox28qq Leon Howard aka Wall Street Trapper grew up in the turbulent streets of New Orleans. His mother was shot in front of him when he was 9 years old. He took to the street life early and was arrested and tried as an adult at the age of 16 for attempted murder and armed robbery. He was found guilty and sentenced to 10 years in Louisiana state penitentiary. He was introduced to the stock market while he was incarcerated and fell in love with it instantly. He read every book and newspaper he could get his hands on and watched CNBC every morning religiously. When he was released from jail he began working as an ironworker. While he was working he invested 70% of his income. After putting together a strategic plan he quit his job and became a full-time investor and entrepreneur. He now travels the country to teach other people with similar backgrounds about stocks and investing. He credits the stock market for changing his life and getting him out of the cycle of destruction that he was raised in. He now is on a mission to help educate as many people as possible about investing to provide a level of hope that he was not afforded as a youth. He’s 100% self-educated but his knowledge in stocks is on par with an investment banker. In episode 44 he covered and explained every area of stocks in detail. He covered REIT’s, ETF’s, Indexed funds, he explained his strategy in evaluating a company to know if it's a good stock to buy, he explained how to set up a stock account for a child and much more. He also explained how anyone can buy back their financial freedom by way of stock market investing for income.
