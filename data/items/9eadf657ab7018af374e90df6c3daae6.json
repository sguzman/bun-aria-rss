  "description": "On Friday’s Mark Levin Show, Every liberal news outlet is bending over backwards to hype the James Comey interview in the same way they hyped up the fictional Michael Wolff book. Comey, like Wolff, is just another disgruntled former employee, and the politics of his book, which is full of innuendo and gossip couldn’t be more obvious. Comey has been sleazy his entire career, and is a leaker and a slimeball like President Trump said. Also, the media and democrats who were quick to come to Andrew McCabe’s defense after his removal are quiet today. The Inspector General’s report proved that McCabe lied under oath. Comey and McCabe were the two heads of the FBI, two flawed men in positions of power trying to take down Trump. The fact that people applaud leakers like Comey and McCabe is appalling. In addition to Trump, Scooter Libby was another innocent man wrongly charged and pursued by Comey and his gang. Trump pardoned Libby and erased all criminal charges against him for leaking. Later, Russia keeps denying having a role in the chemical attacks in Syria, yet they keep vetoing resolutions about it at the United Nations. Vladimir Putin is claiming that England used chemical weapons in Syria to set up Russia.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
