  "title": "Turtles All The Way Down by John Green",
  "description": "The book follows the protagonist Aza as she pursues a prize to find a fugitive billionaire and the struggles she goes through. Together with her friend Daisy they investigate his disappearance. However, this book is not so much about Aza’s quest for the prize. It centres on Aza’s struggle with her own thoughts as it tears her up from within breaking down the relationships around her. Not usually a genre I read, I was captivated by the author’s use of humour to bring to light a very serious topic, interweaving it amongst a great storyline. I enjoyed how large parts of the story are played within Aza’s head making the reader feel her pain. The author does a great job in making the reader feel empathy for Aza. This book evokes many emotions taking the reader on a rollercoaster, through happiness, pain and in the end hope. A highly recommended read for everyone.\n\nOMBR\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
