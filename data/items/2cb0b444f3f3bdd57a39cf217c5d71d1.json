We're so excited to bring you the new show from the Obsessed Network, \"Strange and Unexplained with Daisy Eagan.\" We've got the first episode here for you in this feed, and two more available right now wherever you get your podcasts.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Listen to the first three episodes and follow \"Strange and Unexplained with Daisy Eagan\" on your favorite podcast player </strong><a href=\"https://lnk.to/ptzIRNzD\"><strong>HERE</strong></a><strong>.<br>\n</strong><br>\n<em>From Executive Producer Patrick Hinds and the Obsessed Network comes a new podcast about all the weird stuff happening around us.</em><br>\n<br>\nDo you believe in ghosts? How about bigfoot? Do you think it’s strange and fascinating that a 4 year old in Oklahoma could look at a black and white picture of a man from the 1930s and say ‘that was me. Before.” And then provide actual, verifiable details of the man’s life? If so, “Strange and Unexplained With Daisy Eagan” is about to be your new favorite podcast.<br>\n<br>\nDaisy is a Tony Award-winning actor, writer, and true crime fanatic. But she’s also a skeptic. Each week She looks at real stories of hauntings, disappearances, UFO encounters, the Bermuda Triangle, near death experiences, and anything else that feels just beyond what we can easily make sense of. She is your guide into the inexplicable details of these stories. But she’s also like, “show me the receipts.”</div>\n",
