  "description": "Corporate stock buybacks have always received attention from investors but suddenly they're a part of the mainstream conversation. Politicians on the left and right-from Bernie Sanders to Marco Rubio -have targeted stock buybacks as they think about ways to address wealth inequality and tax reform. But how much are buybacks really to blame for society's ills?\n\nIn this episode of The Readback, Alex Eule is joined by Barron's associate editor Andrew Bary to discuss the suddenly hot topic of stock buybacks and whether politicians from both sides of the aisle are right to target buybacks as they seek to close the wealth gap.\n\nThe Readback is a weekly, financial podcast from Barron's. Hosted by Alex Eule and produced by Mette Lützhøft.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
