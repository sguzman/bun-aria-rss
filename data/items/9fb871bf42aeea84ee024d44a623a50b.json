  "description": "<p>Jamie Kern Lima thought she’d spend her life in the world of broadcast TV, where after graduating, she began working her way up as a journalist, then eventually news anchor where a bright career was laid out in front of her. Then, the camera started picking up a genetic skin condition that she struggled to hide and threatened to derail what she’d worked for. That experience set in motion a quest that eventually led her out of broadcast journalism and into the world of entrepreneurship where she’d eventually found IT Cosmetics, a company she started in her living room and would eventually sell to L’Oreal for $1.2 Billion, becoming the first female CEO in L’Oreal’s 100+ year history.&nbsp;</p><p>Her journey, though, was anything but smooth, with years of 100+ hour weeks, living hand-to-mouth, miles of no’s and countless dark nights of the soul and even a single moment that would either shut the company down or launch them into the stratosphere, which by the way, it did.
