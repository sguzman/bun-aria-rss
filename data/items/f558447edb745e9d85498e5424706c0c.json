  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, House Judiciary Chair Jerrold Nadler cannot use the judiciary to run his own impeachment investigation without the House of Representatives voting on it.  Secondly, we just witnessed the Robert Mueller debacle, yet Nadler thinks Mueller's feeble testimony is the linchpin in his impeachment investigation. Nadler would have been a great commissar or apparatchik in the Soviet Union! According to Raoul Berger, the founders did not want the President reporting to Congress. Indeed, it was George Mason that suggested the wording of maladministration, which was challenged by James Madison and the phrase \"high crimes and misdemeanors\" was used in its place, so as to limit the power of removal of the president (not broad as Nadler suggests). Rogue Democrats are trying to stop President Trump because they hate his agenda, they hate him as a person, and are trying to improperly use impeachment to get their way. Then, the U.S Supreme Court has ruled that Trump Administration can in fact use $2.5 Billion of military funds to build a fence at the border. Later, Ted Lieu in effect, called Mueller a liar for correcting the record when he walked back his statement that but for the OLC opinion he would have indicted Trump.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
