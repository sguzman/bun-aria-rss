  "description": "In this episode we talk about the dining room and how it’s a place for celebration  and we say go wild and really embrace the fact that a dining room is a special place for special occasions.  We discuss the details of lighting, how your chandelier should hang and a few tips to make it look exquisite.  We discuss the round table vs a rectangular table and how it interacts with the shape of your dining room and the type of rug you should get. We bring up the walls and ceiling and the use of paint or wallpaper.  Design your dining room to be different from your kitchen so it stands out as a special place where you and your guests can gather to share special moments.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a><br /><br />What to look for in terms of dining room chandeliers and lighting 4:02<br />What the dining room needs to be 11:10<br />How to get started 12:46<br />Wallpaper and wall paint 20:54<br />Chairs 25:49<br />Host and hostess chairs 29:18<br /><br />“As far as formal versus opinionated, I think you should still be opinionated about it.
