It was there that Anne began keeping a diary that would become one of the most recognisable testimonies of the Jewish war-time experiences. But what do we know of her life before the war? Host James Rogers explores the Franks' lives before the outbreak of war, and why this story is still so relevant today.</p>\n<p>You can find more from Warfare at <a href=\"https://podfollow.com/the-world-wars\" data-saferedirecturl=\"https://www.google.com/url?q=https://podfollow.com/the-world-wars&source=gmail&ust=1665753652950000&usg=AOvVaw2uisVd1P2pIeXXYYblRX0N\">https://podfollow.com/the-world-wars</a>.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
