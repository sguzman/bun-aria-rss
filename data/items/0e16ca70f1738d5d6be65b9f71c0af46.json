  "title": "How to Talk About Death with Your Kids",
  "description": "When our children ask us difficult questions like \"What happens when you die?\" or \"Am I going to die?\", we often get stuck about what to do next. Should we talk about it? Should we avoid it? Should we offer a euphemism? We often assume kids are too young to talk about death, but here's something to consider: It's *never* too early to talk about things that are already on your child's mind. In this episode, Dr. Becky explains why we need to be honest with our kids about death, so they feel safe coming to us with all kinds of tricky questions throughout their lives. She shares practical scripts and strategies to guide you through difficult, but direct, conversations on death, dying, and grief. Remember: This is an emotional topic for us adults too, so before pressing play today, take a deep breath. Honor the feelings and sensations that come up for you as you listen to this episode.\n\nJoin Good Inside Membership: https://bit.ly/3cqgG2A \nFollow Dr. Becky on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drbeckyatgoodinside \nSign up for our weekly email, Good Insider: https://www.goodinside.com/newsletter \nPre-order Dr. Becky's upcoming book, Good Inside: A Guide to Becoming the Parent You Want to Be: www.goodinside.com/book or wherever you order your books.",
