  "description": "<p>Following work on joint object-action representation, functional\nobject-oriented networks (FOON) were introduced as a knowledge representation\nfor robots. A FOON contains symbolic (high-level) concepts useful to a robot's\nunderstanding of tasks and its environment for object-level planning. Prior to\nthis work, little has been done to show how plans acquired from FOON can be\nexecuted by a robot, as the concepts in a FOON are too abstract for immediate\nexecution. We propose a hierarchical task planning approach that translates a\nFOON graph into a PDDL-based representation of domain knowledge for\nmanipulation planning. As a result of this process, a manipulation plan can be\nacquired, which can be executed by a robot from start to end, leveraging the\nuse of action contexts and skills as dynamic movement primitives (DMPs). We\ndemonstrate the entire pipeline from planning to execution using CoppeliaSim\nand show how learned action contexts can be extended to never-before-seen\nscenarios.\n</p>",
