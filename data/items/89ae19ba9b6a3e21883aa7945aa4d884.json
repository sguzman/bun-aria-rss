  "description": "<p>There are certain Modernist houses that just can’t be captured in a photo, a video, or even a 3D rendering.

It starred in countless movies and TV plus music videos for ATB and Wilson Phillips. In 2013 it was listed on the National Register of Historic Places.  <strong>Shari Stahl Grunwald</strong> grew up in the home and administers the property with her brother Bruce.  </p>",
