  "description": "Like a lot of things, CES looks slightly different this year. We take a quick look at some of the tech items making their way into the news from the virtual trade show. Then, we discuss our first virtual smartphone event of 2021, the full Samsung Galaxy S21 line, and the final design of the new S21 itself. Finally, we speak with our special guest Kyle Conner, who was previously featured on last week's episode. He currently holds the EV cross-country cannonball record and tells us how he got into EV's and exactly how he planned for the lengthy trip in the Porsche Taycan.\n\nLinks:\nhttps://twitter.com/wvfrm   \nhttps://twitter.com/mkbhd  \nhttps://twitter.com/andymanganell  \nhttps://www.instagram.com/wvfrmpodcast/  \nshop.mkbhd.com  \nMusic by KamrenB: https://spoti.fi/2WRJOFh  \nKyle Conner: https://twitter.com/Out_of_Spec  \nhttps://outofspecstudios.com/  \nhttps://bit.ly/3bDS4AS  \n\n              \n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
