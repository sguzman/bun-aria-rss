  "title": "'Scallop Discos': How Some Glitzy Lights Could Lead To A Low-Impact Fishery",
  "description": "Scientists in the UK have discovered that if they take a pot meant for catching crabs and just add some bright lights, scallops flock through the door like it's Studio 54. Scallops are normally fished via trawling or dredging—methods that can cause lasting damage to delicate seafloor ecosystems. So this accidental discovery (the lights were initially added to attract crab) could have a significant impact on scallop fishing. We talk with one of the scientists, Robert Enever of Fishtek Marine, a company that creates sustainable fishing gear, about this collaboration between science, industry and conservation.<br/><br/>Follow Short Wave on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/NPRShortWave?s=20&t=7EqCVnuGq5utlbl2_B-KDg\">@NPRShortWave</a>.
