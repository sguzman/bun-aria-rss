  "description": "The story of Pecos Bill is that of a true American Hero...who spends half the story naked and who legitimately thinks he is actually a coyote. But don't tell him that. He's cool and won't hurt you, but you'll get into a long discussion and won't actually convince him or his horse (named Pegasus/Widowmaker/Jeremy) that he's actually a human being. Also, while we're at it, he can lasso water and air because I guess when you ask the audience to suspend disbelief, you go for broke. The creature this time is the Mongolian Death Worm. It's a sand worm, but don't go getting your maker hooks just yet, because it's no Shai Hulud. And that's a problem, because instead of the spice melange that will give you longevity and maybe prescience, it spits a virulent neurotoxin that will do precisely the exact opposite. ---------- Sponsors: Loot Crate: as usual, Loot Crate offers awesome, monthly subscription boxes full of epic and exclusive gear and collectables.
