  "description": "<p>Monday 10/9- Today on the show we opened up the phone lines to see if any of our listeners tell their partner where they are at, at all times, however, according to Charlamagne, if the man did not put a ring on it or if they are not living together, the significant other does not need to know. Also, we had a listener shoot their shot at a girl he met at a family gathering and got very close, but little did they know they were closer in blood than they thought. Moreover, Charlamagne gave \"Donkey of the Day\" to Mike Pence for trying to pull a PR stunt by leaving a Colts- 49ers football game because many football players decided to take a knee during the national anthem.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
