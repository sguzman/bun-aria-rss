  "description": "<p>One of the few enumerated powers that the Founders granted to the federal government was the power to issue patents.</p> <p>Patents are a compromise between two conflicting goals. On the one hand, we want to avoid the creation of government-protected monopolies because monopolies stifle innovation. On the other, we want entrepreneurs to have an incentive to innovate. And one way to incentivize entrepreneurs is to grant monopoly protection for their inventions.</p> <p>Patent law is an attempt to balance these two conflicting goals, but the balance presents trade offs. Weaker patent laws mean cheaper goods today but a lesser variety of goods tomorrow; stronger patent laws mean more expensive goods today but a greater variety of goods tomorrow.</p> <p><strong>Show your support for Words & Numbers at Patreon:</strong> <a href= \"https://www.patreon.com/wordsandnumbers\">https://www.patreon.com/wordsandnumbers</a></p> <p><strong>Quick hits</strong></p> <p>Why did the South Bronx burn? <a href= \"https://www.latinousa.org/2019/02/06/decadeoffire/\">https://www.latinousa.org/2019/02/06/decadeoffire/</a></p> <p>A history of NYC rent control <a href= \"https://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20100610/BLOGS01/306109998/a-history-lesson-on-rent-regulation-in-the-1970s\"> https://www.crainsnewyork.com/article/20100610/BLOGS01/306109998/a-history-lesson-on-rent-regulation-in-the-1970s</a></p> <p>Property tax<br /> <a href= \"https://fox4kc.com/2019/11/28/kansas-city-woman-angry-about-her-property-taxes-paying-with-nickels/amp/\"> https://fox4kc.com/2019/11/28/kansas-city-woman-angry-about-her-property-taxes-paying-with-nickels/amp/</a></p> <p>Merchants taking dollars<br /> <a href= \"https://theconversation.com/if-cash-is-king-how-can-stores-refuse-to-take-your-dollars-63516\"> https://theconversation.com/if-cash-is-king-how-can-stores-refuse-to-take-your-dollars-63516</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/businesses-taking-benjamins-baby/story\"> https://abcnews.go.com/Blotter/businesses-taking-benjamins-baby/story</a></p> <p><strong>Foolishness of the Week</strong></p> <p>Michael Bloomberg and “those people” <a href= \"https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2018/05/24/bloomberg_regressive_taxes_on_the_poor_a_good_thing.html\"> https://www.realclearpolitics.com/video/2018/05/24/bloomberg_regressive_taxes_on_the_poor_a_good_thing.html</a></p> <p><strong>Topic of the Week</strong></p> <p>The Constitution and Patents <a href= \"https://www.ipwatchdog.com/2017/11/14/constitutional-underpinnings-patent-law/id=90190/\"> https://www.ipwatchdog.com/2017/11/14/constitutional-underpinnings-patent-law/id=90190/</a></p> <p><strong>Join the Conversation</strong></p> <p>Words & Numbers Backstage <a href= \"https://www.facebook.com/groups/130029457649243/\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/130029457649243/</a></p> <p><a href=\"mailto:wordsandnumberspodcast@gmail.com\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Let us know what you think!</a></p> <p>Antony Davies on Twitter<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/antonydavies\">https://twitter.com/antonydavies</a></p> <p>James R.
