  "description": "<p>The cartoonist Liana Finck’s new book, <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/11/books/review/liana-finck-let-there-be-light.html\" target=\"_blank\">“Let There Be Light,”</a> recasts the story of Genesis with a female God who is a neurotic artist.</p><p>“At the very beginning of this book, she’s existing in a void and she just decides to make something,” Finck says. “And it’s all fun and games until she starts to feel some self-doubt and realizes that she hasn’t done well enough. She’s really kind of a self-portrait of me at that point. She’s well-intentioned, she’s happy and she’s very hard on herself.”</p><p>Jonathan Van Ness of “Queer Eye” fame visits the podcast to discuss his new book, <a href=\"https://www.harpercollins.com/products/love-that-story-jonathan-van-ness?variant=39422040965154\" target=\"_blank\">“Love That Story.”</a> He talks to Lauren Christensen, an editor at the Book Review.</p><p>“As a queer person, we are told very early on what spaces you are able to thrive in. Beauty is often one of those spaces. There are just a lot of spaces that you can be directed to. And I love hairdressing and I love beauty and I love what I get to do on ‘Queer Eye,’” Van Ness says. “So I am eternally grateful to that. But also, I think that queer people who are feminine and who are flamboyant — as I’ve been called my entire life — are not also allowed to be information gatherers, are also not allowed to be seen as credible.” He continues: “Obviously I didn’t go to journalism school. I didn’t graduate college. But that doesn’t mean that I can’t learn and share my experiences with others.”</p><p>Also on this week’s episode, Joumana Khatib and Dave Kim talk about what they’ve been reading. John Williams is the host.</p><p>Here are the books discussed in this week’s “What We’re Reading”:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/08/10/books/review/in-the-country-of-others-leila-slimani.html\" target=\"_blank\">“In the Country of Others”</a> by Leïla Slimani</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/01/04/books/review/phenotypes-paulo-scott.html\" target=\"_blank\">“Phenotypes”</a> by Paulo Scott</p><p><a href=\"https://www.andotherstories.org/tamarisk-row/\" target=\"_blank\">“Tamarisk Row”</a> by Gerald Murnane</p><p><i>We would love to hear your thoughts about this episode, and about the Book Review’s podcast in general.
