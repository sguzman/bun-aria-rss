The dish contains nuts, which OP's roommate is extremely allergic to. When she eats the dish, she has a reaction and has to use an epipen. The roommate flips out on OP and demands that OP pays for her epipen because OP is \"responsible\" for the dish with nuts. But lady... YOU STOLE THE DISH! That makes you a thief, so why should OP pay you anything?</p>\n",
