  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, WREC Radio Host Ben Ferguson fills in. Celebrating America is exactly what we do on the 4th of July, yet the left took exception to President Trump's \"Salute To America\" festivities at the nation's Capitol. Then, Colin Kaepernick demanded that Nike not release the Air Max One featuring the Betsy Ross version of the American Flag. Athletes like Kaepernick and Meghan Rapinoe from the U.S Soccer Team are not patriots, they are anti-American. Yet, the President celebrating Independence Day was labeled as \"disgusting\" by the likes of Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez and others on the left. There is a hatred and obsession for the destruction of Trump and those that support America. Later, the citizenship question is back and the President is considering using an executive order to get it done. Democrats need illegal immigrants in key Congressional districts to affect the census, simply counting citizens would change their balance of power. After, the media completely ignores the Independence Day celebration, claiming it was more of a campaign event than a parade.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
