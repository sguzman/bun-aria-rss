  "description": "<p>The Gila National Forest covers about 3.3 million acres in southwest New Mexico. During the dry summer season, wildfires pose a serious threat to the area. To spot wildfires in this vast landscape as soon as they start, the U.S. Forest Service relies on fire towers spread throughout the area that are each manned by a lone individual. My guest today wrote a memoir about the unique experience this job offers. His name is <a href=\"http://philipconnors.com\" target=\"_blank\">Philip Connors</a>, he's a writer and one of the country's few remaining fire watchers. Today on the show we discuss what the life of a fire watcher is like and what it’s taught him about nature, solitude, and time. Along the way, Phillip describes the virtues of listening to baseball games by radio and the value of slowing down in an increasingly rushed world.</p><p>Get the show notes at <a href=\"http://aom.is/firewatch\" target=\"_blank\">aom.is/firewatch</a>.</p>\n",
