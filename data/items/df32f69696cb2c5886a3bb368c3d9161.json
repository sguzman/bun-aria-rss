  "description": "The House Impeachment managers proved beyond any reasonable doubt that Donald Trump incited an insurrection against the US government that resulted in six deaths over 140 injuries and profound damage to our democracy. Good as they were, we have to admit, it wasn't that tough to do because we all saw the events unfold. So, ensuring justice will be done should be easy, right? Not so fast. The Senate Kangaroo court you will remember from a year ago is back in session and most of the GOP simply do not care about facts or the law or the Constitution or the judgment of history. Which is why Trump will be acquitted. But...what then? What does it mean? Can other prosecutions follow? We discuss with former US Attorney Barb McQuade, NYU Law's Ryan Goodman and Dr. Kavita Patel of the Brookings Institution. We also include an update on a bunch of breaking COVID news with Kavita. So...don't miss this episode.Each week, we’re bringing you a new episode of one of our favorite podcasts, Deep State Radio.
