  "description": "<p>We can all agree that our health is so important to take care of – but when our ‘focus to improve our health’ begins to monopolize our thoughts and create obsessive food behaviors, it’s time to re-set our perspective, sister. In this episode, Jordan brings on Registered Dietician, author of Chasing Freedom, and Founder of Fresh Fit N Healthy, Sarah Grace, as they discuss how to fuel your body well with food AND thought, understanding your deep ‘why’ behind getting fit, and the science behind food pairings and hormones that make you feel full after eating. There can be a lot of pressure when we set high expectations for ourselves, but there IS freedom to be had even before you reach that fitness goal. It’s time to break up with those unhealthy thoughts cycling through your mind and begin your healthy and balanced relationship with food- and yourself.</p>  <p><a href=\"https://instagram.com/jordanleedooley\" target=\"_blank\">@jordanleedooley</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://instagram.com/shepodcast\" target=\"_blank\">@shepodcast</a></p>  <p>Episode Details: <a href=\"https://jordanleedooley.com/experience-food-freedom-eat-to-fuel-your-body\" target=\"_blank\">https://jordanleedooley.com/experience-food-freedom-eat-to-fuel-your-body</a></p>  <p>Interviewee link: <a href=\"https://freshfitnhealthy.clickfunnels.com/nutrition-book\" target=\"_blank\">https://freshfitnhealthy.clickfunnels.com/nutrition-book</a> | <a href=\"https://instagram.com/freshfitnhealthy\" target=\"_blank\">@freshfitnhealthy</a></p>  <p>The SHE Podcast is a part of the Lasting Media network of podcasts.
