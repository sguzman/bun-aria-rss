An employed, married family man, with kids, who just happens to be into gory videos, violence, and has a pornography collection that is apparently open to friends & neighbors to borrow. The murder is as bad as it gets. Torture, dissection, and dismemberment, and a brain, jammed into the garbage disposal.
