The premise is 100% accurate, but isn't it also true that many in the sports media crucify LeBron James for doing the same in the NBA? Why does Brady get celebrated for building Super Teams while LeBron gets ridiculed? Talk about your double standard.

While many in the college basketball community have labeled Johnson as a 'quitter', Jason argues that the freshman phenom is just doing what's best for his career.

Plus, Bleacher Report Lakers insider Eric Pincus swings by to discuss how he expects the Purple and Gold to weather the storm following Anthony Davis' latest injury, why he doesn't expect LeBron James to suddenly start taking nights off to preserve himself for the NBA Playoffs, why Lakers fans shouldn't expect the team to be a realistic landing spot for big men like Andre Drummond and Blake Griffin, why the front office views Talen Horton-Tucker as such a big piece of their future, if there's any team in the Western Conference who can compete with a fully-healthy Lakers squad in the postseason, and much more!</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
