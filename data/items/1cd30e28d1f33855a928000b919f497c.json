  "description": "<p>Your life is like a wheel.</p> <p>There are so many different components that come together to create your own personal \"circle of life\" (cue the Lion King Music!).</p> <p>These components are: Your health - your family and relationships - your career/work or mission - your finances - and your spiritual health and contribution.</p> <p>Life is not complete without the growth and development in all of these areas. The problem is, we are usually very off balance in one or the other based on where we are in our life.</p> <p>Your body might be banging, but your finances are in the toilet. You might have awesome relationships, but you're simultaneously struggling in your career. So, you see, your \"circle of life\" (your wheel) is usually pretty jagged and bumpy because of some parts being up and some parts being down... and this is what leads to a very bumpy ride in life.</p> <p>The truth is, life will have it's ups and downs, but there can be a lot more smooth sailing if you're able to grow gracefully and consistently in all areas. The question really is: How do you do it? And today, I have the perfect person to show you exactly how it's done.</p> <p>Many years ago I was sitting with my then girlfriend (now my wife... yep, I scored!) and we were watching this film that my amazing mother-in-law said we HAVE to watch...</p> <p>I honestly wasn't very interested in watching it... I had so much going on with trying to figure out how to structure my client's programs and even how I was going to pay my rent.</p> <p>We clicked play, and something unexpected happened.</p> <p>A man named Bob Proctor came on the screen with this confidence, grace, and sense of knowing that I'd never experienced before. I hung on his every word, and whatever this man had figured out, I wanted to know it too!</p> <p>The film broke down the hidden, but extremely real world of quantum mechanics. Not in a, \"you'd better put on your pocket protector way\", but in a real world \"I get this\" way that made me realize something profound.</p> <p>I realized in that moment what I had always known intuitively my entire life... That I matter. That I'm special. That I'm here to share the unique gifts that I have. That I am influencing the world around me (for the good and the not-so-good) based on the predominant thoughts that I'm carrying around in my mind.</p> <p>Bob told me that day, \"If you can see it in your mind, you can hold it in your hand.\"</p> <p>The science in the film really spoke to my man-brain. The message in the film really spoke to my heart.</p> <p>Today I'm beyond honored to say that I have Bob Proctor on my show to be able to share him with you. In my mind him connecting with me is a result of hard work and effort. In my heart him connecting with me is a result of how powerful we all our to attract into our life the people, things, and resources we need to make the life we want a reality.
