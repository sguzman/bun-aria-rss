  "description": "<p>Tulsi is a 2020 presidential candidate for the Democratic party. She is a congress woman from Hawaii and is only 38 years old. She had a really good conversation with Joe and seemed very down to earth. Joe talks to her about many issues on his podcast and it was really enlightening to learn what she had to say. Doing these review podcasts is a lot of fun when I pay a bunch of attention to what's being said and then get to discuss it with you guys. Thanks as always for downloading!</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Enjoy my review folks!</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Please email me with any suggestions and questions for future shows :</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com</p>\n",
