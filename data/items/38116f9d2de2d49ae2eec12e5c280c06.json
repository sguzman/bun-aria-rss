  "description": "Neither President Trump nor Iran want war, and Iran’s missile strikes on U.S. military bases last night were proof. But while the missiles intentionally missed their targets with no casualties, some in the U.S. media took Iranian propaganda at face value! Journalist Lara Logan calls in with a firsthand perspective on the Iraqi people and honest reporting in the Middle East. Rep. Chris Stewart argues that U.S. intelligence proves that America can benefit greatly from Trump’s actions, but Nancy Pelosi and the Left must stop siding with Iran over Trump. On his 20th anniversary, Glenn gives his best marriage advice. President Trump sends a strong message to the world that there’s no need to put up with Iran’s bullying any more.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
