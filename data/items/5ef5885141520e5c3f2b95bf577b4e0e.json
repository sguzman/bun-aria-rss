  "title": "PMS 2.0 190 - Lane Johnson, Dustin Colquitt, Ryan Leaf, & Sam Roberts Stop By For A Damn Good Friday (Considering The Circumstances)",
  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys dive into Jay Glazer's big news and the blowback he received on Twitter for reporting that Rams Center Brian Allen had tested positive&nbsp;for coronavirus, and are joined by a couple of great guests. First, Super Bowl Champion, 3x Pro Bowler and All-Pro Tackle, Lane Johnson joins the show. Pat and Lane chat about that Eagles Super Bowl team and what made them so special, Jason Kelce putting him on the spot at the Super Bowl parade, what things were like with Carson Wentz and Nick Foles/what makes Carson Wentz so special, and what he's been doing to get through the quarantine (9:14-20:21). Next, Super Bowl Champion, 2x Pro Bowler, a member of The Brand, Chiefs Punter Dustin Colquitt joins the program. Pat and Dustin chat about his 16 years in Kansas City and how he has seen things change during his time there, why he knew they were going to be special with Andy Reid at the helm, what it's like getting to experience having Patrick Mahomes as your quarterback, why having a juggernaut of an offense actually puts more pressure on him, and how he's been handling the quarantine with his five kids (20:23-40:24). Next, former #2 overall pick of the 1998 NFL Draft and friend of the show, Ryan Leaf joins Pat and the boys via FaceTime. They discuss his top quarterbacks in this years draft, why Tua's injury history gives him reason for concern, what it was like trying to deal with the pressure of being anointed the franchise quarterback, what he expects to happen on draft night, and where he thinks a good landing spot for Jalen Hurts might be (43:35-59:18). To close out the show, friend of the program, co-host of The Jim & Sam Show on SiriusXM, host of the Notsam Wrestling podcast, and Pat's co-host on the NXT preshows, Sam Roberts calls in from his home studio. Pat and Sam discuss the recent WWE layoffs and how that impacts the company, what he's hearing from some of the current wrestlers, what he thinks this means for WWE in the future, and how he got his wife to be okay with people constantly taking digs at him on social media (59:20-1:09:50). We hope everyone has a safe and relaxing weekend. Don't forget to send in the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat with a picture of where you're listening to the show for the chance to win some free merch. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
