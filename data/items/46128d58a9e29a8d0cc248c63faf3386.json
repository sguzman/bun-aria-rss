But given finite\ncomputation, how do we select inference methods such that they provide accurate\nestimates of quantities of interest?\nIn this talk I will argue for a more explicit consideration of bias-variance\ntradeoffs of common inference methods.  In particular, I highlight that current\ninference methods such as variational inference and Markov Chain Monte Carlo\nmake a particular bias-variance tradeoffs which may be suboptimal for our\ninferential question at hand.  What can we do about this?  There is a rich\nportfolio of methods to change bias-variance tradeoffs in the form of debiasing\nmethods; I will provide a brief overview and demonstrate a number of recent\nsuccessful applications of these methods to variational inference and\nstochastic gradient MCMC.</p>\n<p>Here are the talk slides and a voice recording (I believe the symposium\norganizers plan to eventually release a video recording).</p>\n<iframe src=\"https://onedrive.live.com/embed?cid=6B87C0D396848478&resid=6B87C0D396848478%21302673&authkey=AE32qfwl4bKRia0&em=2\" width=\"402\" height=\"327\" frameborder=\"0\" scrolling=\"no\"></iframe>\n\n<p><audio controls>\n<source src=\"/sebastian/talks/aabi2018-talk-nowozin.mp3\" type=\"audio/mpeg\"/>\n<source src=\"/sebastian/talks/aabi2018-talk-nowozin.ogg\" type=\"audio/ogg\"/>\n</audio></p>",
