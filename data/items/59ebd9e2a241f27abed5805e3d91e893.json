That is not the case in Vladmir Nabokov's Lolita.</p><p>This week we share with you&nbsp;an uncomfortable discussion about how it feels to read a book told from the perspective of an unrepentant pedophile—how do you feel about him? How do we feel about him? How does&nbsp;he&nbsp;feel about him? The difficult subject matter is just one of the things that has earned&nbsp;Lolita&nbsp;its place in the literary canon.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
