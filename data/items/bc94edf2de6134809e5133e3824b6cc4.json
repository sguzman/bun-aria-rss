  "description": "<p class=\"\">Our official IAD reread will resume January 2nd, with <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Lpjs6x\" target=\"_blank\">Néomi (ghost) & Conrad (vampire)</a> and we have so. many. feelings. SO MANY.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Show Notes</strong></p><p class=\"\">- In case you're curious, here's where Jen learned to <a href=\"http://www.capetalk.co.za/articles/243029/mills-and-boon-finds-fresh-talent-in-cape-town\">properly pronounce Therese Beharrie's name</a>. Therese wrote 2 Christmas books this year: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2S3YU62\"><strong>A Wedding One Christmas</strong></a> and <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2QQFZP1\"><strong>Her Festive Flirtation</strong></a>, and Jen liked them both.</p><p class=\"\"><em>- </em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2UQhWyy\"><em>Before Sunrise</em></a> came out in 1995, a sequel <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2EqYlQ7\"><em>Before Sunset</em></a> in 2004, and a third <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2ExxNgL\"><em>Before Midnight</em></a> in 2013. This <a href=\"https://www.newyorker.com/culture/richard-brody/before-midnight-after-birth\">New Yorker review</a> is a perfect example of everything Jen hates when people review anything romantic, so hate-read it if you're in the mood.</p><p class=\"\">- Jen completely got the name of that chapter book wrong, it's <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Elq9oN\"><strong>The Best Christmas Pageant Ever</strong></a>.</p><p class=\"\">- <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2SNA6zl\">Novellas are really common in romance</a>, maybe more than other genres, and Jen anxioulsy awaits the think-piece explaining why.</p><p class=\"\">- Speaking of novellas: The anthology of Chanukah stories that Sarah mentioned is called <a href=\"https://twitter.com/mance_whoa/status/1069982284604981248\"><strong>Burning Bright</strong></a>; <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2SPfA14\"><strong>Reindeer Games</strong> </a>is an anthology of stories with the snowed-in trope; and in <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2R1NAdL\"><strong>Silver Belles</strong></a>, all the characters are over 40.</p><p class=\"\">- Sarah described the cover of <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2R1NXVH\"><strong>A Holiday of Love</strong></a> as an example of a certain type of old-school book package. But just last year, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2PDdlvX\"><strong>A Christmas to Remember</strong></a> with Lisa Kleypas, Lorraine Heath, Megan Frampton, and Vivienne Lorret followed the same exact cover protocol.</p><p class=\"\">- <a href=\"https://lithub.com/in-praise-of-the-epistolary-novel/\">Epistolary novels</a> are super fun to read (Jen's favorite is <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Ensq2T\"><strong>Where'd You Go, Bernadette</strong></a>, Sarah is--unsurprisingly--very pro epistolary romance; her favorite is Kleypas's <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2R8gAAg\"><strong>Love in the Afternoon</strong></a>), but Jen's pretty interested in how <a href=\"http://www.tbqsbookpalace.com/2018/10/group-reviewdiscussion-thrall.html\">they are changing in the age of the internet</a>.</p><p class=\"\">- All three of <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2BoUujh\">the books</a> in <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2rEOuOK\">the Men at Work series</a> by Tiffany Reisz are delightful, but <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2S1RtfR\">the Thanksgiving one </a>is an absolute classic.</p><p class=\"\">- Last year, Jen <a href=\"http://www.tbqsbookpalace.com/2017/11/who-did-it-better-on-thanksgiving.html\">ranked Thanksgiving romances</a> for The Book Queen.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>- </strong><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2QT2Vgt\"><strong>How the Dukes Stole Christmas</strong></a> is pretty great, and here's where <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JenReadsRomance/status/1057817226521272320\">Jen talked about Joanna Shupe's novella</a> on twitter.</p>",
