  "description": "In 2016, Russia not only helped elect Donald Trump, they also assured Americans would never again be able to look at election results with the same trust they had in the past. If anything, actions by them, the Administration, other bad actors and incompetent administrators have raised unease about what we might expect in this year's election cycle. Beyond that, risks we have focused on in the past, like terrorism, might manifest themselves again--perhaps from dangerous, white supremacist sources. Are we prepared? We discuss with Juliette Kayyem of Harvard's Kennedy School, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law School and David Sanger of the New York Times. Don't miss this episode.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
