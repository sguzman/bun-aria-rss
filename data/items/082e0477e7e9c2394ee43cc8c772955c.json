  "description": "Whenever we go out in this season we’re reaching for our masks and gloves to protect ourselves from an invisible virus. Pastor Steven Furtick of Elevation Church in Charlotte, NC is helping us keep our minds safe from fear, frustration, and even an unhealthy obsession with ”‘the facts.”’ He says, “We need medical masks for our minds,” so we can “Focus On The Fruit.”\n\nThis message was built from two key Bible passages, Philippians 1:12-22 written by the Apostle Paul while he was in prison and Romans 8:18-28.\n\nRomans 8:28 says, “And we know that is all things God works for the good of those who love him, who have been called according to His purpose.” Even if we feel like we’ve been given a prison sentence in this season, we can choose to focus on the word of God, we can choose to turn graves Into gardens.\n\nWhen you watch this message, you’ll learn how to shift your mind to the only thing you really can control —, what you choose to focus on. You’re going to learn the power and significance of the phrase, “I don’t know.” \n\nDon’t focus on your frustrations, your fears or even the facts, in this season, we need to “Focus On The Fruit.” To support this ministry and help us continue to reach people all around the world click here: http://ele.vc/TI55jR\n",
