  "description": " If you visited South Nashville today, you might not suspect that, over a century ago, it was home to a zoo and amusement park called the Glendale Zoo. Among other attractions, the zoo had a popular attraction called \"horse diving,\" in which a performer rode a horse off a tall platform into a body of water. In her book, <em>When Two Feathers Fell From The Sky, </em>Verble imagines the life of a young Cherokee girl named Two Feathers, who horse dives for a living at the zoo in the year 1926 — set against the background of the Jim Crow South and widespread mistreatment of Native Americans.
