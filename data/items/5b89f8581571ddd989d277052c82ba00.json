She was in the middle of a divorce with her husband who told her friends that she was visiting her sick mother back in Denmark and that he didn't know when she'd be back. But as weeks passed and she'd missed multiple flights for work and hadn't returned any of her friends calls, they began to fear for the worse. When police finally began investigating her disappearance, they discovered that just before she was last seen, her husband had made some strange purchases. This is the murder of Helle Crafts.
