  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, KARN host Doc Washburn fills in for Mark. Texas has brought a legal matter to the Supreme Court charging the states of Michigan, Pennsylvania, Wisconsin, and Georgia with hurting the Texas election because of those states' unconstitutional changes to existing election laws. Afterward, new congressional testimony reveals a potential cure for COVID-19. The CDC has edited its website to indicate that they no longer believe that COVID-19 was transmitted through contact with dry surfaces although that was disputed. There was also the controversy over mask-wearing, non-mask-wearing, and the efficacy of vaccines. Yet people were told to go and vote even if they were symptomatic, but Thanksgiving with families was scaled back. The latest is that mask-wearing might be more effective at allaying anxiety than at preventing COVID-19 in public spaces where people physically distance and spend less than 15-minutes next to one another.  Later, Dr. Pierre Kory testified in front of the US Senate's Homeland Security Committee and blasted members that doubted the science he was presenting. Kory reiterated that he was appalled that the drug research that he and his colleagues conducted on re-purposed drugs was not being considered or fast-tracked. He touted the evidence on Ivermectin as miraculous and declared that \"if you take it, you will not get sick.\"\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
