Big Food brands design their packaged products to be addictive, so we over consume unhealthy ingredients, including cheap additives that are banned in other countries. Product labels are deceiving, hiding risky chemicals that contaminate our food and tout approval from organizations we’re led to believe are protecting our health, but in reality are doing anything but that.&nbsp;</p><br><p>On this episode of <em>The Doctor’s Farmacy</em>, I was so happy to talk to Vani Hari about how Big Food manipulates nutrition research, purposely makes their food addictive, and how we can regenerate our health by getting in the kitchen.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Named as one of the “Most Influential People on the Internet” by <em>Time</em> Magazine, Vani Hari is the revolutionary food activist behind foodbabe.com, co-founder of organic food brand Truvani, <em>New York Times</em> best selling author of, <em>The Food Babe Way</em>, and <em>Feeding You Lies</em>. She has led campaigns against food giants like Kraft, Starbucks, Chick-fil-A, Subway and General Mills that attracted more than 500,000 signatures, and led to the removal of several controversial ingredients used by these companies. Through corporate activism, petitions, and social media campaigns, Vani and her Food Babe Army have become one of the most powerful populist forces in the health and food industries.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Her drive to change the food system inspired the creation of her new company, Truvani, where she produces real food without added chemicals, products without toxins, and labels without lies. Vani has been profiled in the <em>New York Times</em> and <em>The Atlantic</em>, and has appeared on Good Morning America, CBS This Morning, CNN, The Dr. Oz Show, The Doctors, and NPR.&nbsp;</p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by Tushy, Perfect Keto, and Thrive Market.</p><br><p>The Tushy bidet is a sleek attachment that clips onto your existing toilet and connects to the water supply behind your toilet to spray you with clean, fresh water.
