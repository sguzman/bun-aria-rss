  "description": "<p>That fuzzy sandwich in your fridge? Yeah, don't eat that kind of fungus. But the mushrooms in your stir fry? Or the yeast in your bread? Or the rind on your brie? Or the miso in your soup? All of those delicious foods are possible thanks to fungus!</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In this episode, we'll learn about how our ancestors first figured it out some mushrooms were safe to eat, we'll learn about the microbes that make cheese possible, and we'll meet some fungal chefs who are key to cooking up some of our favorite foods. Plus a brand new mystery sound and a Moment of Um that answers the question: \"How does rubbing two sticks together make fire?\"</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This episode was sponsored by: </p>\n<p>Mathnasium (<a href=\"http://mathnasium.com/\" class=\"c-link\">mathnasium.com</a>)</p>\n<p>Sakara (<a href=\"http://sakara.com/brainson\" class=\"c-link\">sakara.com/brainson</a>)</p>\n<p>Indeed (<a href=\"http://indeed.com/brainson\" class=\"c-link\">indeed.com/brainson</a>)</p>\n",
