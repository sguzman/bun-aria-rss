  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, the Senate impeachment trial was a spectacle. The Democrats showed zero proof to support the Constitutionality of impeaching a private citizen or to prove that Donald Trump caused an attack that we already know was pre-planned. The House managers Hollywood video left out critical information and it was based on emotion, not facts. The plain text of the impeachment clause is clear, and no president has ever been treated this way since the inception of the Constitution. Trump is charged with inciting an insurrection, yet it was Trump that called for 10,000 national guard troops to be at the ready to protect the Capitol. This case would have been thrown out in any court of law. Then, the Senate is destroying its credibility; its actions are incongruent with the original intent of the founders. The Senate is using their power to walk on the faces of the American people. At America's founding, the vast majority of the original congress fought in the revolutionary war. Sadly, today's congress is well versed in Marxism, not Americanism. David Schoen made a legitimate and effective case against this unconstitutional process in the Senate. Democrats including Joe Biden, have repeatedly called for violence and fighting and have gotten a complete pass. Afterward, the coronavirus continues, and accountability for failed state-level vaccine roll-outs and waiting lists does not. \n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
