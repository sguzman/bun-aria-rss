  "description": "<p>If you love reading pulse-pounding stories about fictional spies, you’ll love Ben Macintyre’s thrilling true (and bestselling) stories about real-world spies, like The Spy and the Traitor, A Spy Among Friends: Kim Philby and the Great Betrayal, and Operation Mincemeat. His latest yes-this-is-absolutely-a-true-story (Ben has the documentation to prove it) book, Agent Sonya, has the pacing of a great novel and plenty of incredible details as the story cuts from Shanghai and Manchuria in the 1920s and 30s to Switzerland and the UK during WWII and into the Cold War (and beyond). Ben joins us on the show to talk about Ursula Burton — wife, mother and dedicated spy — John le Carré, and the joys of writing about espionage (Hint: It’s all about the hunt). Featured book: Agent Sonya by Ben Macintyre. Produced/Hosted by Miwa Messer and engineered by Harry Liang.</p> <p>Poured Over is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify and Stitcher. New episodes drop every Tuesday and Thursday.</p> <p>Follow us here for new episodes every Tuesday and Thursday.</p>",
