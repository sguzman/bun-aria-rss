  "description": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">We're on hiatus until September 14, when we'll start Season 5, but you won’t miss us, because this week, we have the recording of Fated Mates Live, our first-ever in-person live! Headphones in for this one, y’all. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">We were joined in Alexandria, VA by Kate Clayborn, Adriana Herrera, Tracey Livesay, Naima Simone, Ali Hazelwood, Diana Quincy, Andie J. Christopher, and Sophie Jordan, and we had the best time! This audio is imperfect, but there’s so much laughter here — we hope you’ll join us for the next one (which will hopefully be in the spring)…stay tuned on that front! </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Be sure to subscribe to the podcast in your favorite podcasting app so you know the moment we return.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Thanks to Fox & Wit, creators of the <a href=\"https://foxandwit.com/products/foxglove-before-i-let-go-special-edition-by-kennedy-ryan\">Foxglove Special Edition Book Box of Kennedy Ryan's <em>Before I Let Go</em></a><em>, </em>available for preorder now. The box comes with a special edition cover of <em>Before I Let Go</em>, a signed book plate, and a letter from Kennedy herself.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Season 5 starts in two weeks!

We welcomed Kate Clayborn, Adriana Herrera, Tracey Livesay, Naima Simone, Ali Hazelwood, Diana Quincy, Andie J. Christopher, and Sophie Jordan. Thank you to Old Town Books for partnering with us on this event. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Thank you to the audience for their participation! We used a platform called Menti, which turned the screen behind us into an interactive platform (like an Instagram Live) where our audience could respond and comment. If we all have a reaction to something you can't hear....it's because someone in the audience said something brilliantly funny using Menti.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The book Sarah accidentally interstitialed during the recording is <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3cxW0pS\">C.M. Nascosta's <em>Sweet Berries</em></a>.</p>",
