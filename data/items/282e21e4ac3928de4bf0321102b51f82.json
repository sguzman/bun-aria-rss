  "description": "<p>A covering system is a finite collection of arithmetic progressions whose\nunion is the set of integers. The study of these objects was initiated by\nErd\\H{o}s in 1950, and over the following decades he asked many questions about\nthem. Most famously, he asked whether there exist covering systems with\ndistinct moduli whose minimum modulus is arbitrarily large. This problem was\nresolved in 2015 by Hough, who showed that in any such system the minimum\nmodulus is at most $10^{16}$.\n</p>\n<p>The purpose of this note is to give a gentle exposition of a simpler and\nstronger variant of Hough's method, which was recently used to answer several\nother questions about covering systems. We hope that this technique, which we\ncall the distortion method, will have many further applications in other\ncombinatorial settings.\n</p>",
