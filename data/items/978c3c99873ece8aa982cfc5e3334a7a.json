  "description": "Today’s show is an absolutely loaded one. Pat recaps heading down to New Orleans to intro the starting lineups for the New Orleans Pelicans and helping the legend Red Panda during halftime. Pat and the boys also discuss Tom Brady, Julian Edelman, and Jimmy Fallon hanging out at a Syracuse basketball game where Julian Edelman said Tom Brady is coming back and Brady seemingly mouthed, “No he’s not.” Also joining the show is 2x Pro Bowler, All-Pro, a 13 year NFL veteran at linebacker, and current Vice President of the NFLPA, Lorenzo Alexander calls in to chat with Pat about all the recent developments with the negotiations between the NFL and NFLPA, and what it all means (7:37-22:28). Later, former #2 pick in the 1998 NFL Draft, Ryan Leaf joins Pat and the boys in studio. He and Pat discuss his falling out of the NFL, his descent into drug addiction and his long climb back, some crazy stories from his pre draft process, and who he thinks the top 5 quarterbacks in this year’s draft are (36:30-1:46:33). Also joining Pat and the boys in studio is one of the OG’s in the industry, the Voice of the NFL and friend of the show, Rich Eisen. Rich, Pat, and Ryan chat about the combine process, the unprecedented amount of great quarterbacks who are entering free agency this year, and Rich explains what happened behind the scenes with making the NFL combine what it is today (1:11:26-1:46:33). Keep sending tweets with the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat to show where you’re listening to the show for a chance to win some free merch. Come and laugh with us. Cheers.\n",
