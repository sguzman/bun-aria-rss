  "description": "<p>In a recent LIVE broadcast of the Being Human Is Good for Business podcast, the team at Trilogy Effect discusses the challenges of being a leader when, it seems, the whole world is completely stressed out. </p><p>We’re all still ‘in the thick of it’ in terms of coping through this pandemic, and today’s leaders have the job of managing their people, many of whom are dealing with some personal trauma, through a whirlwind of change and stress. </p><p>Recorded as a LIVE show on LinkedIn on February 9th, 2022, leadership experts Heather Marasse, Wendy Appel and Mary Beth Sawicki ask the question that’s top of mind for many people, “How are you doing?” </p><p>They provide insight based on their recent experiences in supporting leaders and lots of practical advice and tips for leaders who may be struggling to support their teams while still hitting their business goals and objectives.   </p><p><a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/wendy-appel\">Wendy Appel</a> explains: “We are going through a collective experience where people’s basic trust has been shaken. And, at the same time organizations are dealing with important issues that have rarely been examined before now such as equality, diversity and inclusion. Add to that the struggle of managing big changes to daily operations such as moving to hybrid workforces, team recruitment and retention and integrating new ways of working! There’s been so much uncertainty, and this equals stress!” </p><p><a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/mary-beth-sawicki\">Mary Beth Sawicki</a> adds: “Today’s leaders need to recognize that many in the workforce are not feeling well, either physically or emotionally. But business goes on and performance demands are not altered. You need to find a healthy balance of performance expectations and empathy for these challenging times.” </p><p>Providing leadership development in this context means taking different and new approaches that account not only for skills development, but also the mental health of the leaders and their teams. That’s why Trilogy Effect is now integrating Internal Family Systems (IFS) into their coaching services. </p><p>IFS is an empowering paradigm for understanding and harmonizing the mind. The coach brings a compassionate approach to guide inquiry into a client’s experience in a self-healing way. </p><p>“We integrate IFS into our coaching and consulting practice,” explains <a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/heather-marasse\">Heather Marasse</a>. “We use what we see as appropriate in the moment with each client. In everything we do, we also practice ourselves.  To be in the business of growth, we need to use compassionate inquiry and develop self-compassion in order to extend it to others. With IFS, we are able to meet this important client need.” </p><h2>Listen to the full LIVE episode to learn: </h2><ul><li>How pandemic stress is impacting workers.</li><li>Are we seeing collective trauma in today’s workplace? </li><li>How is pandemic stress changing leadership? </li><li>What is IFS and how does it change the coaching experience? </li></ul><p>Links to information about the issues discussed in this show: </p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/blog/podcast-navigating-the-great-resignation-of-2021\">Navigating the Great Resignation of 2021</a></li><li><a href=\"https://ifs-institute.com/\">What is Internal Family Systems?</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/health/archive/2022/02/covid-precautions-stay-flexible/622082/\">Post-Omicron Life Can Be Downright Maddening</a></li></ul><p>We invite you to subscribe to the Being Human Is Good for Business Podcast on iTunes, Amazon, Google Podcasts, iHeart Radio, and Spotify (links below) or wherever you get your podcasts.
