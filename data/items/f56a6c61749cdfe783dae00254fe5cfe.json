  "description": "Episode 05 of the Plant Proof Podcast with Peter Cervoni Chef Peter Cervoni is a veteran of the food service industry, and brings with him well over 30 years of proven, professional culinary experience to the realm of plant-based, health-supportive cuisine. Peter graduated from the Culinary Institute of America in 1993, and after an apprenticeship at The Breakers Resort in Palm Beach, FL, Peter worked at some of New York City's finest restaurants, including The River Café and La Cote Basque. After experiencing what can only be described as an epiphany leading to his paradigmatic switch to become vegan 21 years ago, Peter devoted all his talent and energy to plant-based and health supportive cuisine. Since that time Peter has worked at the helm of top New York City vegan restaurants, such as Angelica Kitchen, Quintessence and Organic Avenue in addition to consulting for many others. Besides being a chef, Peter has held almost every job imaginable in the culinary world from food writer for Vegetarian Times, to food stylist and culinary educator.
