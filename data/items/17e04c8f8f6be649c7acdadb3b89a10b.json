  "description": "<p>I am proud to bring you this very metaphysical chat with Don Devore who is the guitarist for Ink and Dagger, Frail and Collapsing Scenery (among many other projects). Ink and Dagger were huge for me personally and I celebrate their entire catalog and Frail was such a force of nature for the early screamo/hardcore scene that I was stoked Don wanted to talk about that. We go in about how chaotic the Ink and Dagger experience was, creating art at all costs and of course, Vampires. Love the discussion and I hope you do as well.&nbsp;</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
