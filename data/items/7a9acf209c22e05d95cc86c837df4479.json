  "description": "<p>In this episode of Quah (Q & A), Sal, Adam & Justin answer Pump Head questions about <span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">changing nutrition to account for being much more sedentary, the advantages of increasing or decreasing weight, the benefits to doing workouts in higher temperatures and helping a family member understand the advantages of weightlifting.</span></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Shopping in the age of COVID-19.

She used to do CrossFit and I think she is a little scared to lift weights because of how intense it was in CrossFit. She now does a lot of cardio and I am very proud of her for starting to get healthy again. But I would like her to better understand that weightlifting will help her more in the long run. I do not want to think I’m telling her what she is doing wrong though.  (1:11:13)</span></li> </ul> <p><strong>Related Links/Products Mentioned</strong></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href= \"http://www.mapspowerlift.com/\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">March Promotion: MAPS Powerlift ½ off! **Code “POWER50” at checkout**</span></a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href= \"http://www.mapswhite.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Special Promotion: MAPS Anywhere ½ off!! **Code “WHITE50” at checkout**</span></a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href= \"https://www.msn.com/en-us/lifestyle/lifestyle-buzz/lvmhs-perfume-factories-are-now-making-hand-sanitizer-to-respond-to-the-coronavirus/ar-BB11krb0\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">LVMH’s Perfume Factories Are Now Making Hand Sanitizer to Respond to the Coronavirus</span></a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href= \"https://www.bizjournals.com/losangeles/news/2020/03/23/anheuser-busch-to-make-hand-sanitizer-to-combat.html\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Anheuser-Busch to make hand sanitizer to combat coronavirus spread</span></a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href= \"https://www.msn.com/en-us/news/technology/ford-joins-tesla-and-gm-in-helping-with-ventilator-and-mask-supply/ar-BB11E4Ui\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Ford joins Tesla and GM in helping with ventilator and mask supply</span></a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href= \"https://www.unacast.com/covid19/social-distancing-scoreboard\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> Covid-19 Social Distancing Scoreboard — Unacast</span></a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Visit</span> <a href= \"http://www.vuoriclothing.com/mindpump\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Vuori Clothing</span></a> <span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">for an exclusive offer for Mind Pump listeners!</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href= \"https://www.dailymail.co.uk/femail/article-3921618/I-m-beans-Vegan-mother-drink-smoothies-friend-s-SPERM-swears-s-discovered-secret-not-catching-flu.html\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">'I'm full of beans': Vegan mother who drinks smoothies made from a friend’s SPERM swears she’s discovered the secret to not catching the flu</span></a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href= \"https://nypost.com/2020/03/24/new-york-hospitals-treating-coronavirus-patients-with-vitamin-c/\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">New York hospitals treating coronavirus patients with vitamin C</span></a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href= \"https://www.forbes.com/sites/alexreimer/2020/03/25/tokyo-olympics-postponement-will-have-crippling-impact-on-sports-tv-revenue-experts-say/#e3659726b3a2\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tokyo Olympics Postponement Will Have Devastating Impact On Sports TV Revenue, Experts Say</span></a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href= \"https://www.msn.com/en-my/news/world/dolphins-and-swans-appear-in-venice-canals-a-week-after-city-locks-down-to-prevent-coronavirus-spread/ar-BB11pPM7\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Dolphins and swans appear in Venice canals a week after city locks down to prevent coronavirus spread</span></a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href= \"https://www.msn.com/en-us/health/medical/study-says-your-blood-type-could-make-you-more-susceptible-to-coronavirus/ar-BB11Eymq\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Study says your blood type could make you more susceptible to coronavirus</span></a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Visit</span> <a href= \"https://getkion.com/mindpump\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Kion</span></a> <span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">for an exclusive offer for Mind Pump listeners!</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href= \"https://www.cnbc.com/2020/03/24/trump-approval-rating-rises-amid-response-to-coronavirus.html\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trump approval rating rises as he responds to the coronavirus outbreak</span></a></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href= \"https://www.wimhofmethod.com/cold-therapy\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">What are the Benefits of Cold Therapy?
