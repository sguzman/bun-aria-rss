  "title": "Malala Yousafzai: What Is Your Defining Moment?",
  "description": "<p>In every life, there are defining moments when a person must decide whether to stand up for what is right or remain silent. At a young age, Pakistani activist Malala Yousafzai began boldly advocating for girls' access to education, which had been denied by the Taliban, an extremist Islamic group. The consequences were grave. In October 2012, the Taliban shot Malala point-blank in the head because of her outspoken beliefs. Miraculously, Malala survived and would go on to become the co-founder of the Malala Fund, which seeks to advocate and provide education to millions of young girls globally who are denied an education because of poverty, violence or tradition. Two years after the attack, Malala became the youngest person to receive the Nobel Peace Prize. Malala describes to Oprah the last moment she remembers before being shot. The young activist says her recovery taught her that \"there is nothing greater than the love and the prayer of people.\" Later in the podcast, Malala's father, Ziauddin, joins the discussion and explains why he felt closest to God on the day Malala was attacked.</p>\n",
