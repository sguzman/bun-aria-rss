It’s time to turn&nbsp;quitters into people who commit, courtesy of one of the toughest people on the planet.&nbsp;Fire ready aim!</p><p>If the name&nbsp;<strong>Joe De Sena</strong>&nbsp;strikes a familiar chord, it’s likely because he’s the entrepreneurial mastermind behind&nbsp;Spartan—the obstacle course racing series that became a global phenomenon. Fewer&nbsp;know he’s also the evil genius behind&nbsp;Death Race—perhaps the most absurd sufferfest ever conceived.&nbsp;</p><p>Under appreciated is just what an utter machine this guy is. An absolute endurance freak, in a mere one week period, Joe completed the&nbsp;Vermont 100&nbsp;mile run,&nbsp;Ironman Lake Placid,&nbsp;and the&nbsp;Badwater 135.&nbsp;In addition, Joe knocked off 50 ultramarathons and 14 Ironman events in a single year (a certain kind of insanity that must be some kind of record). To top it off, on a whim, he once ran&nbsp;from New York City to Vermont.</p><p>A man of questionable masochism, Joe knows hustle. But his relentlessness isn’t limited to athletics. It begins with business, servicing mafioso swimming pools as a Queens high schooler. It appears&nbsp;in academics. It took him four attempts to secure admission to Cornell. And, most importantly, it shows up in service. At his Vermont farm, Joe freely welcomes all who dare join in his legendary daily&nbsp;grind. Everything Joe does—be it Spartan,&nbsp;his books&nbsp;or public speaking—reflects his genuine commitment to helping millions of people live healthier more fulfilling lives.</p><p>Today he shares his extraordinary story.</p><p>This is a conversation about commitment to an ideal. How to manifest the better self within. And pay it back in service to others.</p><p>It’s about Joe’s colorful life path. His Goodfellas-esque upbringing. His natural-born entrepreneurial inclinations. His insane endurance feats and unique relationship with suffering. And the impenetrable focus required to accomplish lofty dreams.</p><p>But more than anything,&nbsp;this is about turning quitters into people who commit.&nbsp;It’s about why doing hard things makes you better, happier and healthier. And it’s about the potential we all possess to catalyze radical transformation.</p><p>From the heart, Joe is bullshit-free and 100% authentic. His message is powerful. Entirely experience-based. And paired with practical tools fundamental to shattering stagnation.</p><p>The visually inclined can watch our exchange on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://youtu.be/pTpgBd4-voQ\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube</a>.
