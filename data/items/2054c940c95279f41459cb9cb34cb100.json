Rejected by all humans who see him, the monster takes his revenge on Frankenstein, killing those dear to him. Shelley started writing Frankenstein when she was 18, prompted by a competition she had with Byron and her husband Percy Shelley to tell a ghost story while they were rained in in the summer of 1816 at the Villa Diodati by Lake Geneva.\n\nThe image of Mary Shelley, above, was first exhibited in 1840.\n\nWith\n\nKaren O'Brien\nProfessor of English Literature at the University of Oxford\n\nMichael Rossington\nProfessor of Romantic Literature at Newcastle University\n\nAnd \n\nJane Thomas\nProfessor of Victorian and Early 20th Century Literature at the University of Hull\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson\n\nThis programme is a repeat",
