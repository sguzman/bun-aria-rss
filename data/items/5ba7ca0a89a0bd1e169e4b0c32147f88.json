Blum's company, which largely makes low-budget \"genre\" films such as \"The Purge,\" \"Happy Death Day\" and \"Paranormal Activity,\" scored a Best Picture nomination this year with Jordan Peele's hit thriller \"Get Out.\" He talks about the experience of awaiting — and losing — that Oscar, as well as what makes Blumhouse so different from all the other companies more commonly represented at the big awards shows. Plus: Why the studio is often happy to sell its films directly to Netflix or Amazon, rather than sending them to theaters, and why Blum thinks the Hollywood establishment has already lost the in-theater vs. at-home battle.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
