  "description": "<p>This week we're rolling back the tape and issuing apologies for things said in podcasts past. But first, Jessica updates June on the new arrival in her household brought to her by a stork (or a man named Steven) and the gals discuss why we can all take a page out of the books of widows from the Olden Days. Then, Jessica learns that sometimes getting a blow out and going back to the garbage bag curtains is important to one's well-being and June lets us in on the transformation that's been happening to her beloved dog, Meatball. Finally, we learn what (and who) is and is not appropriate to take to bed. Remember Deep Divers, sometimes it's about what you’re NOT saying. </p><p><br /> </p><p>Visit the Pinterest Board <a href=\"http://pinterest.com/thedeepdive\">pinterest.com/thedeepdive</a></p><p>You can follow The Deep Dive on Twitter @thedeepdivepod</p><p>June Diane Raphael @MsJuneDiane on Twitter @junediane on Instagram</p><p>Jessica St. Clair @Jessica_StClair on Twitter @stclairjessica on Instagram</p><p>Check out the Jane Club at <a href=\"https://www.janeclub.com\">www.janeclub.com</a></p><p>Send us your The Deep Dive theme or any questions you might have to thedeepdive@earwolf.com</p>\n",
