  "title": "\"Woke\" Culture is Destroying Movies and Comedy",
  "description": "<p><p>Whether it's the small comedy club in Massachusetts that got shutdown this weekend because the club owner didn't like mean jokes or an entire film industry that can only seem to produce crappy remakes of Ocean's 11 and Ghostbusters,\"woke\" culture is ruining our entertainment. Minihane previews his forthcoming film-centric podcast with a look at some real Hollywood flops. A radio show host in Colorado claims he was kicked off the air for being critical of President Trump, but we're not sure his story lines up. Minihane picks a date for his tennis match with his producer. Robinson provides updates on planning for the First Annual Kirk Minihane Ice Fishing Expedition. A new parody song offers a scary glimpse of what the ice fishing trip may become. </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
