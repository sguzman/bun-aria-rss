The first 200 listeners will also get 20% off an annual membership.\n\nDefining 1/0 = ∞ isn't actually that bad, and actually the natural definition if you are on the Riemann sphere - ∞ is just an ordinary point on the sphere! Here is the exposition on Möbius maps, which will explain why 1/0 = ∞ isn't actually something crazy. And this video will also briefly mention the applications of the Möbius map.\n\nThere will also be things like circular and spherical inversion, which are really neat tools in Euclidean geometry to help us establish lots of interesting results, this one included.\n\nThis video was sponsored by Brilliant.\n\nVideo chapters:\n00:00 Intro\n02:38 Chapter 1: The 2D perspective\n08:43 Chapter 2: More about inversion\n14:33 Chapter 3: The 3D perspective (1/z)\n19:38 Chapter 4: The 3D perspective (general)\n---------------------------------------------------\nSOURCES:\n[That 2012 paper] Rigid motion 1-1 Möbius map: https://scholar.rose-hulman.edu/cgi/viewcontent.cgi?article=1218&context=rhumj\nMöbius transformations revealed: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0z1fIsUNhO4\nAccompanying paper: https://www-users.cse.umn.edu/~arnold//papers/moebius.pdf\nUnitary iff rotation: https://users.math.msu.edu/users/shapiro/pubvit/Downloads/RS_Rotation/rotation.pdf\nMöbius iff sphere: https://home.iitm.ac.in/jaikrishnan/MA5360/files/mobius.pdf\nRotation of Riemann sphere: https://people.reed.edu/~jerry/311/rotate.pdf\nCircle-preserving implies Möbius: https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/epdf/10.1002/mana.19670330506\nProblem of Apollonius video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z6GG8zsMWH8\nPower of a point: https://www.nagwa.com/en/explainers/798164323509\n--------------------------------------------------------\nMORE CONNECTIONS OF MÖBIUS MAPS:\nSir Roger Penrose lecture on the book with Rindler (Spinors and space-time): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=fzYV6VrsHyQ\nThe book: https://www.cambridge.org/core/books/spinors-and-spacetime/B66766D4755F13B98F95D0EB6DF26526\nHyperbolic geometry: https://assets.cambridge.org/97811071/16740/excerpt/9781107116740_excerpt.pdf\nConformal mapping (fluid mechanics): https://math.berkeley.edu/~iliopoum/Topics_121A/Conformal%20mapping%20in%20fluid%20mechanics.pdf\n--------------------------------------------------------\nMusic used:\nAakash Gandhi - Heavenly / Kiss the Sky / Lifting Dreams / White River\nAsher Fulero - The Closing of Summer\n--------------------------------------------------------\n\nOther than commenting on the video, you are very welcome to fill in a Google form linked below, which helps me make better videos by catering for your math levels:\nhttps://forms.gle/QJ29hocF9uQAyZyH6\n\nIf you want to know more interesting Mathematics, stay tuned for the next video!\n\nSUBSCRIBE and see you in the next video!\n\nIf you are wondering how I made all these videos, even though it is stylistically similar to 3Blue1Brown, I don't use his animation engine Manim, but I will probably reveal how I did it in a potential subscriber milestone, so do subscribe!\n\nSocial media:\n\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/mathemaniacyt\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/_mathemaniac_/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/mathemaniacyt\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/mathemaniac (support if you want to and can afford to!)\nMerch: https://mathemaniac.myspreadshop.co.uk\n\nFor my contact email, check my About page on a PC.\n\nSee you next time!",
