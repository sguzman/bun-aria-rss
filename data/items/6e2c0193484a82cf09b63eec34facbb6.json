  "description": "In today's podcast, we hear about how Equifax continues to struggle in the quicksand of wayward patching and clumsy incident response. Congress, the FTC, the CFPB, and DoNotPay are all taking an interest. Another unsecured database—this one for sale to political campaigns—is found (Alaska voters are affected). Kaspersky says his company is a bystander that's been hit in the Russo-American political crossfire. The US Navy continues to investigate the USS McCain collision. Justin Harvey from Accenture on what it’s like to be on an incident response team. Luke Beeson from BT on the challenges such a large organization faces protecting themselves and their clients. And Harvard decides Manning won't be a Kennedy School Fellow after all.",
