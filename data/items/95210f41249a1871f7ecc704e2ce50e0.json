  "description": "<p>In today’s episode, Todd takes a deep dive into Season 1 of the hit, true-crime podcast Culpable with the host of Culpable, Dennis Cooper. Season 1 tells the story of the suspicious death of Christian Andreacchio of Meridian, MS, the controversial death investigation that was ruled a suicide and Christian’s mother’s uphill battle to get the case re-opened and investigated as a homicide.</p>\n<p>As you’ll learn in this episode, Dennis, who is also the founder of Black Mountain Media, and his team not only do a brilliant job of telling this compelling story but they also, with the help of a team of private investigators, cast even more doubt on the integrity of the police investigation and the coroner’s ruling. It’s a story we felt compelled to share and we’re grateful to Dennis for coming on the show to do so.</p>\n<p>You can listen to Culpable anywhere you listen to podcasts. You can follow them at @culpablepodcast on Twitter and Instagram and you can visit their website at <a href=\"http://culpablepodcast.com/\" target=\"_blank\">culpablepodcast.com</a>.</p>\n<p>Black Mountain Media is offering a $100,000 reward to anyone who provides information that helps solve this case.
