  "description": "It seemed as though we'd have back-to-back weeks with a double dose of Monday Night Football. That turned out to not be the case as Broncos-Patriots was pushed back again, but we still have Chargers-Saints slated as the true Week 5 MNF game. On this episode, Will Brinson is joined by Tyler Sullivan to break down the game from a gambling perspective. Michael Thomas was set to return and then he decided to punch a teammate in the face, so New Orleans will be without a top weapon. What does that mean for Alvin Kamara related props? Brinson believes Drew Brees despises the Chargers, but will that hatred convert to the playing field for the aging QB? Listen for the picks, props and DFS advice you need if you want more action after the weekend.\nFollow the Pick Six team on Twitter: @picksixpod, @willbrinson, @TylerSully\nVisit the Pick Six YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/picksix\nCheck out the Pick Six Instagram page https://www.instagram.com/picksixpod/?hl=en\nJoin our Facebook group https://www.facebook.com/groups/758548147935545/\nFor more NFL coverage from CBS Sports, visit https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/\nTo hear more from the CBS Sports Podcast Network, visit https://www.cbssports.com/podcasts/\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
