  "description": "<p><strong>Ana Ros</strong> is widely considered the best chef in Slovenia, and will soon be featured on Season 2 of the Netflix hit show Chef’s Table. She runs Hi a Franko, a countryside estate and restaurant that has been in her husband’s family for decades and happens to be the location where Ernest Hemingway wrote A Farewell To Arms. Ana never intended to be a chef — she was an international studies and diplomacy student when she met her husband, Valter, and they took over running Hi a Franko together. Ana taught herself how to cook with the help of Valter’s mother, and soon she was running a top notch kitchen and creating an entirely new kind of food: high‐end Slovenian cuisine. Outside the kitchen, Ana works with recovering drug addicts by teaching them how to cook, and she also works with young cooks to help them develop their careers.</p>\n<p><strong>Katie Parla</strong> moved to Rome in 2003 after graduating from Yale, and recently co‐authored the cookbook Tasting Rome, pulling from her experiences abroad. She holds a sommelier certificate and a master’s degree in Italian gastronomic culture. Katie has written about restaurants, drinks, and food culture for more than a decade, and her writing and recipes have appeared in the New York Times, Saveur, Food & Wine, and Australian Gourmet Traveller. She is the author of National Geographic’s Walking Rome, two mobile dining apps, and her Saveur‐nominated food and travel blog. She often appears as a Rome expert on the History Channel, Travel Channel, and the university lecture circuit.</p>\n<p><strong>Kristina Gill</strong> is the food and drinks editor at DesignSponge.com, a home and lifestyle site with over 1.2 million readers per month. Her original recipes, and those she hand‐selects from celebrated authors, chefs, and readers, have appeared weekly as the “In the Kitchen with” column since 2007. She is also a food and travel photographer, and the co‐author of Tasting Rome. Kristina transferred to Rome in 1999 after earning her BA from Stanford and her MA from Johns Hopkins SAIS.</p>\n",
