  "description": "<p>The two bears, Tom Segura and Bert Kreischer, reunite in the cave today to celebrate Bert's new Stand-Up Netflix special \"Hey Big Boy\" that becomes available to watch on Netflix March 17, 2020 on St. Patrick's Day! We first get into seeing exactly how much worse Bert looks now from when he taped his special (3-ish months apart). It's WILD. We get into both tom and Bert doing press for their upcoming specials (Tom's \"Ball Hog\" comes out March 24, 2020). They discuss writing material, how great Andrew Schulz's way of making content is, strip club stories, Ian Bagg stories, and a cool video where some guy found a baby CRAWLING ON THE HIGHWAY.</p>\n",
