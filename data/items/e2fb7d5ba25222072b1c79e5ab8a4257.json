  "description": "On Friday’s Mark Levin show, Ben Ferguson of WREC Memphis fills in for Mark. Sadly, six people are dead from Hurricane Florence which was downgraded from a category one storm to a tropical storm. Political critics of President Trump are blaming him for the hurricane, as if he were some kind if all-powerful hurricane God. In fact, the editorial board of the Washington Post opined that Trump's positions on climate change make him complicit in Hurricane Florence. Then Clayton Neville, a correspondent for Westwood One calls in to discuss how the next 48-72 hours of flooding rains and 70-80 MPH winds will wear on trees, foundations and other infrastructure. Most people took heed to the mandatory evacuations, despite the terrible news of a mother and child who were killed. Later Brett Jensen from WBT calls in with an update from Wilmington, NC where Hurricane Florence made landfall. Afterwards the New York Times reports that Ambassador Nikki Haley bought curtains that cost $54,000, and then had to correcttheir reporting when it was discovered that the curtains were ordered by the Obama Administration.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
