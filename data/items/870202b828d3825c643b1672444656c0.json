  "description": "On Monday, the United States and Russia spoke for hours in an attempt to forge a diplomatic end to Russian aggression towards Ukraine.  Russian Deputy Foreign Minister Sergei Ryabkov said that the talks resulted in \"no progress\" while Deputy Secretary of State Wendy Sherman made it clear that \"We're not to a point where we're ready to set down texts and begin to go back and forth.\"  To discuss the impact of these talks and what the future could look like, DSR host David Rothkopf spoke with Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute, and Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University. Will Russia further invade Ukraine?  What leverage does the United States have?  What is driving Putin to act this way? Find out the answers to these and other questions in this prescient conversation. \nIn the bonus segment for members, David Rothkopf speaks with David Sanger about his recent reporting about the sanctions that the United States may impose if Russia moves forward with a full-scale invasion.  \nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
