  "description": "<p>Jasmine Cho has one of the most unconventional jobs in the food world: She’s a cookie activist. What began as a way to spotlight overlooked trailblazers in the Asian American and Pacific Islander communities has expanded to include people of color making a difference in the world, from poet Amanda Gorman to organizer Stacey Abrams to first responders in Jasmine’s hometown of Pittsburgh. She painstakingly recreates their images in royal icing and shares her creations on everything from social media to exhibitions organized by the Smithsonian. Jasmine joins us to talk about her activism, her book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Role-Models-Who-Look-Like/dp/0692157972\"><i>Role Models Who Look Like Me: Asian Americans</i> <i>and Pacific Islanders Who Made History</i></a>, and how it feels to have the mayor name a day for her. </p><p>Thank you to Cypress Grove, the makers of Humboldt Fog and Little Giant goat cheese, for supporting Radio Cherry Bombe.</p>\n",
