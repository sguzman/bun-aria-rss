  "description": "<p>In the process of finding high-performance organic semiconductors (OSCs), it\nis of paramount importance in material development to identify important\nfunctional units that play key roles in material performance and subsequently\nestablish substructure-property relationships. Herein, we describe a\npolymer-unit fingerprint (PUFp) generation framework. Machine learning (ML)\nmodels can be used to determine structure-mobility relationships by using PUFp\ninformation as structural input with 678 pieces of collected OSC data. A\npolymer-unit library consisting of 445 units is constructed, and the key\npolymer units for the mobility of OSCs are identified. By investigating the\ncombinations of polymer units with mobility performance, a scheme for designing\npolymer OSC materials by combining ML approaches and PUFp information is\nproposed to not only passively predict OSC mobility but also actively provide\nstructural guidance for new high-mobility OSC material design. The proposed\nscheme demonstrates the ability to screen new materials through pre-evaluation\nand classification ML steps and is an alternative methodology for applying ML\nin new high-mobility OSC discovery.\n</p>",
