  "description": "In Episode #204, I’m joined by leading researchers Dr Emily Manoogian and Dr Courtney Peterson. Drs Emily and Courtney both research the way food timing interacts with the body, focusing on time-restricted eating (TRE).\n\nIn this episode, we approach the topic with a key question: is there any advantage of time-restricted eating other than helping people eat fewer calories to achieve a healthy body weight? You’ll learn the specifics of what TRE is, the purported benefits, what we know, and what we’re yet to discover. We also discuss the work of Drs Emily and Courtney, and comment on the recent study from China that is making waves.\n\nSpecifically, we cover:\n\n\nIntro (0:00)\n\nDebate of Fasting Benefits (2:11)\n\nFasting Defined (6:20)\n\nCircadian Rhythm & Meal Timing (17:26)\n\nHistory of TRE Studies (25:32)\n\nCalorie Restriction vs TRE (46:29)\n\nDebunking Trials that DIDN’T work (58:27)\n\nCancer (1:25:40)\n\nAging (1:31:56)\n\nWomen’s Health & Lean Muscle (1:35:37)\n\nOptimal Eating Windows (1:41:55)\n\nTraining & Breaking the Fast (1:48:36)\n\nShift Workers (1:55:15)\n\nLongevity & Protein (2:02:13)\n\nOutro (2:04:33)\n\n\nYou can learn more about Dr Courtney Peterson here.
