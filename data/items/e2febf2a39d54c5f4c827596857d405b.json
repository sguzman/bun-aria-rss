After working alongside Michael Gove and Dominic Cummings at Education, he was Special Adviser to the Prime Minister from March to July 2020. Gabriel takes us inside Number 10 during the first months of the pandemic and his role in tracking public opinion during that time. This is a treasure trove of political insights, many of which may contradict perceived wisdom. A fascinating insider account of being at the heart of government during a global crisis, this is also a cautionary tale for Labour. Gabriel is a former Labour activist and he explains how Labour has fundamentally misunderstood the character and appeal of Boris Johnson.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Follow Gabriel on Twitter: @gabrielmilland</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>NEW GUESTS ANNOUNCED FOR THE POLITICAL PARTY LIVE:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>27 Sept: Andy Burnham</p><p>11 Oct: Penny Mordaunt</p><p>25 Oct: Caroline Flint</p><p>8 Nov: Anas Sarwar</p><p>22 Nov: Anthony Scaramucci</p><p>6 Dec: Jeremy Hunt</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Buy tickets to The Political Party, live at The Duchess Theatre including the opening night with&nbsp;<strong>Andy Burnham on Monday 27 September</strong>&nbsp;here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nimaxtheatres.com/shows/the-political-party-with-matt-forde/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nimaxtheatres.com/shows/the-political-party-with-matt-forde/</a> </p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Email the show: <a href=\"mailto:politicalpartypodcast@gmail.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">politicalpartypodcast@gmail.com</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Follow Matt on Twitter: @mattforde</p><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
