  "description": "<div>On this week's podcast: <br>\n<br>\nAfter the markets saw off Kwarteng, Trussonomics and now Truss herself, James Forsyth writes in <em>The Spectator </em>that the markets will be driving British politics for the foreseeable future. He is joined by Britain economics editor at the <em>Economist </em>Soumaya Keynes to discuss the institutions now dictating government policy (00:56).<br>\n<br>\nAlso this week:<br>\n<br>\nLooking ahead to the American midterms next month, are we heading for a 'red wave'? Freddy Gray says in his piece for the magazine that the Democrats could be in for a shellacking come November. He is joined by Washington editor at Spectator World, Amber Athey (13:41).<br>\n<br>\nAnd finally:<br>\n<br>\nShould the Parthenon Marbles be returned to Athens?<br>\n<br>\nIn <em>The Spectator</em> this week, Noel Malcolm says this age-old question is far from simple. He is joined by Lord Vaizey, chair of the new advisory board The Parthenon Project, to consider whether we can really justify keeping the Elgin Marbles in the British Museum (21:00). <br>\n<br>\nHosted by William Moore. <br>\n<br>\nProduced by Oscar Edmondson. </div>\n",
