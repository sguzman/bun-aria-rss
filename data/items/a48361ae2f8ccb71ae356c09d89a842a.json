  "description": "<p>Baby, today? We CELEBRATE. Because Gabriel Ocasio-Cortez is on Las Culturistas! Matt and Bowen thank this man for nominating his sister (who is AOC!!!) to Brand New Congress, who backed her successful and ultimately iconic congressional run as depicted in Netflix's \"Knock Down The House\". The boys discuss what it's like for Gabe to watch his sister become an icon, how the media depicts and responds to her, and break down recent primary elections. Gabe also talks about the 2007 Grammys and how Kanye and Amy Winehouse both taught him a powerful lesson that night. Also, a red table moment re: Beyoncé in the eyes of the Grammys, tons of Mariah T (the memoir is coming, people!!!!), the culture around \"talking shit\", How Big Is Too Big For An Iced Cube, and Bronx motherfucking appreciation. It's an EP-I-SODE. We LOVE Gabe.
