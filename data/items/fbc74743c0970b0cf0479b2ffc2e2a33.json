  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys  chat about MLB Opening Day, who is supposed to be good this year, and why baseball has lost so much steam as America's Pastime, plus they cover the fallout from the Justin Fields conversation from yesterday, and wrap up the other things happening around the NFL. Joining the show to discuss Opening Day and all things baseball, is friend of the program, Kevin Youkilis. Pat and Kevin discuss his thoughts on how baseball has changed, fights in the MLB, and who he ultimately thinks is going to win the World Series this year (53:27-1:20:00). Later, one of the scariest humans on the face of the earth, the new UFC Heavyweight Champion, Francis \"Predator\" Ngannou, joins the show to chat all about his life leading up to winning the UFC Heavyweight Gold last weekend, what it was like growing up in Cameron and working in the mines at a young age, when he knew he wanted to be a fighter, what he thinks about potentially fighting Jon Jones next, how much he respects Stipe Miocic and why he thinks he needed to lose to him for his career to progress, and what his upcoming plans include (1:27:55-1:53:38).
