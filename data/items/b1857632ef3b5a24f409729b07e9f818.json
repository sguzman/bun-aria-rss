  "description": "On this episode of The Fred Minnick Show, lead singer of rock band Rival Sons, Jay Buchanan, joins Fred. Buchanan, previously a solo artist, helped form Rival Sons in 2008 with guitarist Scott Holiday. Since 2009, the band has released one EP and six full-length albums, citing musical influences ranging from Prince to Van Morrison. During this week's interview, Jay and Fred sip whiskey (because, of course) and discuss topics such as the band's forthcoming album, side projects, ascots, drinking on stage and even modern masculinity.\n\nWhiskeys tasted:\nMichter's Straight Bourbon (14:22)\nPeerless Rye Cherry Cola (26:20)\nM.B. Roland Single Mash (45:06)\n\nEPISODE SUMMARY\n\nFred and Jay talk about a wide variety of things, such as:\nJay doesn't think rock music is as prevalent as it once was, citing several reasons including recording technology and the way labels promote music today. \"Hip hop rules the world,\" he tells Fred.\nHe also talks about rock bands \"locking arms\" and uniting, per an interview he did with Rolling Stone, as a way of lifting up all rock acts.\nFred gets Jay to come clean on drinking all the Michter's straight bourbon Fred had sent him for the show. The two agree that it's a great \"every day pour.\"\nAmerican whiskeys versus Scotch whiskeys and other non-American whiskeys.\nLife as a rock band during the ongoing pandemic, and Jay losing part of his identity. \"It's forced us to be more introspective and take stock in why we really do what we do,\" he says.\nFred talks about his life during the pandemic, losing Bourbon & Beyond and other opportunities, and going from that to remaking himself into a YouTube streamer.\nFred quickly discovers that Jay has quite the whiskey palate.\nJay talks about his minimalist approach to drink before and during shows.\nIn introducing the Peerless Rye to the tasting, Fred talks about the difference between sour mash fermentation and sweet mash.\nThey talk about the slow emergence of rye whiskey and where it might head, and that leads them to talking about trends in alcohol and drinking in general. White Claw rears its head. A spirited discussion of modern American masculinity then takes place.\nThe M.B. Roland they taste only saw a release of 86 bottles.\nQuote of the show: \"When you're drunk, you can't do much ... except drink more.\"\nJay talks about Rival Sons coming together in 2008 and how he originally expected it to simply be a side project to his solo career, as well as what's next for the band.\nThe show wraps with Fred asking Jay which of the three whiskeys was his favorite. His answer is extensive, but the Peerless barely eked out the win.\n\nQUOTABLES\n\nJay compares rye whiskey to modern American masculinity: \"With men, you see the urban lumberjack aesthetic come up everywhere - guys want to have beards, guys want to wear flannel, guys want to wear jeans that will last longer than they will. Guys want to have one pair of boots that are going to the best pair of boots. I think that the return to the masculine culture with men in America, along with that, we're going to watch rye come up because rye is directly related to that rugged individualism.\"\n\nRESOURCES\n\nhttps://www.instagram.com/jaythebirdthatsings\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/jaybuchananrivalsons/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/jaybuchanan\n\nFOLLOW FRED\n\nhtps://www.instagram.com/fredminnick/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/FredMinnick\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyE_GJtYr3yowks2iv1o4jg\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/fred.minnick/\n\nSPONSORS\n\nMichter's: https://michters.com/ \n\nDistillery 291: https://distillery291.com/\n\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.",
