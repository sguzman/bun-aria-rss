  "description": "<p>Trusting Your Basic Goodness - Part 2 - This talk continues the exploration of what causes our distrust of ourselves, others and life, and the pathways to realizing and trusting who we are. We explore the steps of awakening from limiting beliefs, dissolving the resistance to direct embodied presence, and discovering the space and tenderness – the formless dimension – that is indivisible and whole (a favorite from the archives).</p> <p>Your support enables us to continue to offer these talks freely.
