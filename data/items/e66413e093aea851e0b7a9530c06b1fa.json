    "media:description": "Linear algebra is central to almost all areas of mathematics. For instance, linear algebra is fundamental in modern presentations of geometry, including for defining basic objects such as lines, planes and rotations. Also, functional analysis, a branch of mathematical analysis, may be viewed as the application of linear algebra to spaces of functions.\nThe following topics of linear algebra have been presented in this video.\n\n⭐️  Table of Contents ⭐️  \n⌨️  (0:00:00) \n\n⭐ Credit ⭐\nThis great course was developed by : Professor Sean Fitzpatrick\nLicense: Creative Commons Attribution license (reuse allowed)\nYT: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCNTQSJzbc90IjFJjlCIQpGQ\n\n⭐ Join our community ⭐\nJoin our FB Group: https://www.facebook.com/groups/cslesson\nLike our FB Page: https://www.facebook.com/cslesson/\nWebsite: https://cslesson.org",
