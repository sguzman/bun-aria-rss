  "description": "Our audiobook this week is FIT TO BE STAPLED by Lauren Smith\n\nHe’s the CEO and she’s off limits…\n\nSpencer Howe can’t let anyone know what’s going on in his head, especially when he daydreams about bending his junior ad account manager over her desk and showing her what her sass does to him. Cate Cross isn’t just sassy though, she’s beautiful, brilliant, and perfect for the senior account manager position at his advertising firm.\n\nHe knows he gets under her skin when he calls her his assistant. He does it to get a rise out of her, and she throws it right back at him. There is so much chemistry between them, but he knows it won’t work. She can’t stand him most of the time. If he doesn’t get her to accept his company’s promotion soon, he’s afraid another company will take her away from him when she finishes her MBA. He’ll do anything to show her that she’s his, in the office and out, even if that means breaking a desk or two to prove his point.\n\nGET THE eBOOK NOW: https://bit.ly/3qPACzV\nLauren Smith: https://bit.ly/2KBrieX\nGiveaway: https://bit.ly/3qPACzV\nTempting Prince Charming: https://bit.ly/3Sh2msV\nThe Wartime Matchmakers: https://amzn.to/3BvLzeH\nFREE - Wicked Designs: https://bit.ly/3f7zHZa\nBrothers of Ash and Fire Complete Series: https://amzn.to/3Uz2syb\n\n♥ ♥ ♥\n\nBOUGHT BY THE COWBOY by Alexa Riley: https://bit.ly/3BX4v7J\nYOU DADDY LIKES IT by Alexa Riley: https://bit.ly/3dtbpZ8\n\n♥ ♥ ♥\n\nACE OF DIAMONDS by Alta Hensley\nAmazon:  https://amzn.to/3KHjHZ4\nAmazon INTL:  https://bit.ly/3IIrvIl\niBooks: https://apple.co/3uZF9Cy\nNook: https://bit.ly/3rAAMMv\nKobo: https://bit.ly/3jp3lYu\nGoogle Play: https://bit.ly/3jXyqD1\n\nThe Complete Wonderland Trilogy: https://bit.ly/3DA830U\n\n♥ ♥ ♥\n\nRMR Website: https://bit.ly/3ifFIyw\nRead Me Romance Merch: https://bit.ly/39JB8XG\nWeekly New Release: https://bit.ly/30iDete\nFollow Read Me Romance on Instagram: https://geni.us/uUVdVeY\nLatest Alexa Riley Releases: https://bit.ly/3qrQpVS\nJoin Read Me Romance Headquarters on FB: https://geni.us/IdL7B\nFind Alexa Riley on Instagram: https://bit.ly/2HGrxpQ\nAlexa Riley TikTok: https://vm.tiktok.com/TTPdUryXr9/\n\nRead Me Romance Theme Song by L.B.
