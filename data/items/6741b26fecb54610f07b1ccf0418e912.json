I'm going to create a state machine that looks for a specific entry sequence to \"unlock a safe\" (turn on an LED). Enjoy me thinking and writing code LIVE for you lovely people!\n\nGet yourself a Go Board: https://nandland.com/goboard/introduction.html\nThe Keypad: https://store.digilentinc.com/pmod-kypd-16-button-keypad/\n\nIf you like this video, please support me on Patreon!\nhttps://patreon.com/nandland",
