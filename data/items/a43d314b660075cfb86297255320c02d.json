  "description": "<p>We’re all looking to spend less money, especially during these difficult coronavirus days, and one of the best ways to accomplish this is by going with generic or private label brands. Name brands have worked their way into our lives but they come at a cost. And then there’s the big question of: what products or purchases should I go generic with and when should I just stick with the name brand that I know and am more familiar with? During this episode we talk about why we’re fans of generics as well as some categories where it makes sense to make the switch and how to go about making the switch. But we’ll also make an argument for choosing name brands over generics as well- there are some purchases where we can cross over into the territory of cheap in an attempt to become more frugal.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Spotted Cow by New Glarus- thanks to James for donating these beers to the show!
