    "media:description": "We look at the relationships between octaves (2:1), perfect fifths (3:2) and perfect fourths (4:3) as the Pythagoreans envisioned musical intervals, and demonstrate on the piano why there is a fundamental mathematical discrepancy here. Arithmetically it comes down to the fact that a power of three cannot equal a power of two. This investigation also allows us to meet two important sequences of notes: the cycle of fifths and the cycle of fourths.\n\nThis is one of a series of videos on the interplay between mathematics and music that we will see cuts both ways: each subject reveals structure and truths about the other.\n\nI also want to introduce you to my very modest TikTok channel: \n\nwww.tiktok.com/@njwildberger\n\nwhere I am posting some on-the-spot piano improvisations, and the occasional classical piece, some of them not by J. S. Bach.\n\n*******************************\nScreenshot PDFs for my videos are available at the website http://wildegg.com. These give you a concise overview of the contents of the lectures for various Playlists: great for review, study and summary.\n\nMy research papers can be found at my Research Gate page, at https://www.researchgate.net/profile/Norman_Wildberger\n\nMy blog is at http://njwildberger.com/, where I will discuss lots of foundational issues, along with other things.\n\nOnline courses will be developed at openlearning.com. The first one, already underway is Algebraic Calculus One at https://www.openlearning.com/courses/algebraic-calculus-one/ Please join us for an exciting new approach to one of mathematics' most important subjects!\n\nIf you would like to support these new initiatives for mathematics education and research, please consider becoming a Patron of this Channel at https://www.patreon.com/njwildberger Your support would be much appreciated! :)\n\n***********************\nHere are all the Insights into Mathematics Playlists:\n\nElementary Mathematics (K-6) Explained: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?\nlist=PL8403C2F0C89B1333\nYear 9 Maths:   https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85CcGpZpO542YLPeDIf1jqXK\nAncient Mathematics: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85Aqe2b4FBWUGJdYROT6-o4e\nWild West Banking: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85DB7CzoFWvA920NES3g8tJH\nSociology and Pure Mathematics: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85A-qCypcmZqRvaS1pGXpTua\nOld Babylonian Mathematics (with Daniel Mansfield): https://www.youtube.com/playlist?\nlist=PLIljB45xT85CdeBmQZ2QiCEnPQn5KQ6ov\nMath History: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL55C7C83781CF4316\nWild Trig: Intro to Rational Trigonometry: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3C58498718451C47\nMathFoundations: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5A714C94D40392AB\nWild Linear Algebra: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85BhzJ-oWNug1YtUjfWp1qAp\nFamous Math Problems: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85Bfc-S4WHvTIM7E-ir3nAOf\nProbability and Statistics: An Introduction: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85AMigTyprOuf__daeklnLse\nBoole's Logic and Circuit Analysis: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85CnIGIWb7tH1F_S2PyOC8rb\nUniversal Hyperbolic Geometry: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85CN9oJ4gYkuSQQhAtpIucuI\nDifferential Geometry: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85DWUiFYYGqJVtfnkUFWkKtP\nAlgebraic Topology: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6763F57A61FE6FE8\nMath Seminars: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBF39AFBBC3FB30AF\n************************\n\nAnd here are the Wild Egg Maths Playlists:\n\nTriangle Centres: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLBGXDSUohM&list=PLzdiPTrEWyz6VcJQ5xcuqY6g4DWjvpmjM\nSix: An elementary course in pure mathematics: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdiPTrEWyz4KD007Ge10dfrDVc4YwlYS\nAlgebraic Calculus One: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdiPTrEWyz4rKFN541wFKvKPSg5Ea6XB\nAlgebraic Calculus Two: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdiPTrEWyz5VLVr-0LPPgm4T1mtU_DG-\n–º",
