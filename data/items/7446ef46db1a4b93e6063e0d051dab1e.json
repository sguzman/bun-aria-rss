    "media:description": "What are the most extreme cases of human depopulation for a given region in history? Although it has long been thought by sociologists that the human population of the planet is in dire straits of growing exponentially to the point of mass overpopulation, demographic analysis has proven this beyond a shadow of a doubt to be false. Although many areas are still growing, other nations and regions have a depopulation crisis currently brewing and only expected to get worse in the future.\n\nToday, we will be looking at some cases of historic and future depopulation, wherein humans either stop having children, or participate in mass migration to a foreign land (either willingly or unwillingly). This video is not meant to offend anyone from any given country but simply to discuss the reality of the situation for many regions in the past, present and future. Thanks for watching!\n\nExplore the data for yourself: https://vizhub.healthdata.org/population-forecast/",
