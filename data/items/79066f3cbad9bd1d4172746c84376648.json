  "description": "<p>“I was very, very unintentionally smart in that I started it as a short story, I genuinely believed it was a short story, which was good, because if I hadn't sat down and said, I'm now going to write my first novel I'd probably still be working on it, but because it was a short story that got longer and became a long story, and then became a novella. And then like, Oh, I'm writing the book that I want in the world, both as a person and as an editor.” David Levithan’s <em>Boy Meets Boy</em> is one of the most charming rom-coms we’ve ever read, and David joins us on the show to talk about his development as a writer and editor, the power of story, his creative process, his writing partnerships with Rachel Cohn (<em>Dash and Lily’s Book of Dares</em>) and others, his literary influences, <em>Heartstopper</em>, what he’s learned from his readers and much more with Poured Over’s host, Miwa Messer. And we end the show with TBR Topoff book recommendations from Marc and his guest bookseller, Rhys.</p> <p>Featured Books:</p> <p><em>Boy Meets Boy</em> (B&N Exclusive Edition) by David Levithan<br /> <em>Every Day </em>by David Levithan<br /> <em>Answers in the Pages</em> by David Levithan</p> <p><br /> Poured Over is produced and hosted by Miwa Messer and mixed by Harry Liang.
