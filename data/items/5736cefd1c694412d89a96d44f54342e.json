Where do you even begin? What does it take to make that kind of change in your life? In this episode, Jay Samit reveals his latest book, Future Proofing You, and the experiment he ran with a young kid from the UK. He mentored this kid once a week and watched him go from nearly homeless to millionaire in his experiment to show this is possible for anyone regardless of your resources. In this interview, Jay uncovers his belief that you don’t need degrees, capital and major connections to become a successful millionaire. Starting your business by looking for the void to fill in a very specific area that allows you to be the best in the world with no competition is a possibility that is accessible to you right now.
