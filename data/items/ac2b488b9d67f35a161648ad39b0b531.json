  "description": "<p>Two people find themselves in the same room with Jesus: Simon, an intellectual and a religious man, and a woman, who we are told lived “a sinful life.” What happens with them? Why does one of them remain cool and detached, while the other one sees their life transformed and changed?</p>\n<p>In the parable of the two debtors, we see what happens when people come to Jesus with two different conditions, and how Jesus responds to each of them. </p>\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on August 16, 2008. Series: The Parables of Jesus (1992). Scripture: Luke 7:36-50.</p>\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.
