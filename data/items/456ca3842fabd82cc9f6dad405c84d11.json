  "description": "Today we have Cory as the MC and we’re going to be talking about “party fouls,” or common design mistakes. We start out talking about arch niches, which many home builders will install in homes, but they almost always do it wrong. Another thing people often get wrong is their window treatments, where they put one single curtain on either side of the window and end up just looking like a wall scarf. We want them to feel very full and cover your window with gusto and fullness. We talk about rugs and the sizes that people tend to get, such as 8x10, because they think it’ll be big enough, but rarely is that the right size for your main areas. You’ll want a 9x12 to go under your furniture and coffee table in the front room. Some other things to avoid are brass kitchen faucets and vessel sink faucets, which are just impractical because they make cleaning a little harder and are hard to reach for shorter people/kids. <br /><br />Grove 0:57<br />Weird arch niches 3:07<br />Awkward hardware 8:18<br />Window treatments 11:04<br />Scale 14:23<br />Don’t forget to edit 20:41<br />Reclaimed wood 23:26<br />Brass kitchen faucet, vessel sink faucet 25:50<br />Don’t just put color on a throw pillow 29:20<br />Quick fix 33:02<br /><br />“It’s a hard thing to get really right and I think that like reclaimed wood –not really like reclaimed wood, but like that I think it’s had its time in the sun and everybody’s done with that movement, and we're just integrating everything. Integrating the sinks under the surfaces, we’re integrating the hardware. That really beautiful, built-in, well made look is what everybody’s wanting right now.” 28:25<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
