Spoiler Alert: While we do reveal the entire Top 30, we ran out of time to have the necessary conversation about the Top 4 overall players, but that will happen next week. Today, we've got three TEs and the rest are RBs and WRs. Odell Beckham or Mike Evans? Nick Chubb or Todd Gurley? Can Travis Kelce and Zach Ertz get 150 targets again?
