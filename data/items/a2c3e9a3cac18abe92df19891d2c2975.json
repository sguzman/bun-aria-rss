  "description": "<p>Scott Soshnick, Eben Novy-Williams and Michael Barr discuss a host of issues related to the business of sports, including a recent New Jersey lawsuit in which a high school baseball coach was sued after one of his players was injured sliding into third base. The lawsuit, which took over seven years to resolve, has led to a wider discussion about youth sports and culpability of coaches when kids get hurt. Also discussed are new allegations that the Houston Astros were using outfield cameras to steal opposing teams's signs during their World Series title run in 2017. Though stealing signs isn't against MLB rules, it is considered cheating to use technology to do it. Also touched on is the surprise resignation of new Brooklyn Nets CEO David Levy. Levy's departure comes less than two months after he took the job at the Joe Tsai-owned club. He was also part of Tsai's family office.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
