  "description": "<p>In a recent editorial, Kevin DeYoung took aim at Christian commentators, including David French, for criticizing the social and political hypocrisies within white evangelicalism. DeYoung says these necessary corrections are better left to pastors rather than “professional writers, academics, and full-time commentators.” David and Skye respond to DeYoung’s editorial by explaining the good, and bad, reasons so few pastors are speaking prophetically in America today. Then, they turn their attention to the remarkable NY Times report about the U.S. military underreporting civilian casualties from drone attacks in Afghanistan, Iraq, and Syria. French explains why legally the terrorists, not the U.S. military, carry responsibility for these deaths, which leads to a wider discussion about the ethics of war in general, the way drones may change Americans’ view of war in the future, and whether the invasion of Iraq was justifiable to begin with.</p> <p>0:00 - Intro</p> <p>2:40 - Kevin DeYoung editorial on Christian commentators <a href=\"https://wng.org/opinions/deyoung-on-white-evangelicalism-1639659990\"> https://wng.org/opinions/deyoung-on-white-evangelicalism-1639659990</a></p> <p>29:54 - Drone attacks, civilian casualties, and ethics of war <a href= \"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/12/18/us/airstrikes-pentagon-records-civilian-deaths.html\"> https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2021/12/18/us/airstrikes-pentagon-records-civilian-deaths.html</a></p>",
