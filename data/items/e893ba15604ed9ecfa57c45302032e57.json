These include a high-sugar diet; impaired immunity; use of drugs, like antibiotics, birth control pills, estrogen, and steroids; and psychological stress.

In 2000, he founded Cornerstone Family Practice in Rowley, MA. He practiced with a philosophy centered on personal relationships and treating the whole person, not just not the disease. He called that philosophy “Whole Life Wellness”. Over time as the healthcare system made it harder for patients to receive this kind of personal care Dr. Papanicolaou decided a change was needed.
