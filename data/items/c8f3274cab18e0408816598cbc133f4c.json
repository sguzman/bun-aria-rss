  "description": "Today we have on author Kaitlyn Schiess, to discuss her new book ‘The Liturgy of Politics.’ Kaitlyn, a self described ‘Theology Nerd,’ has written for the New York Times, Relevant Magazine and Christianity Today. We have a great conversation about the tenuous relationship between faith and politics. What is liturgy? How do you define politics? How are we and the Church shaped by our habits and practices? We talk about recognizing how formative the political entities around us are, and how we may grow and reconcile them with who we are in the Kingdom.\n\nKaitlyn is currently finishing up her ThM at Dallas Theological Seminary. You can purchase Kaitlyn’s book here: https://www.ivpress.com/the-liturgy-of-politics\n\nAs always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
