  "description": "The Republican and Democratic parties are not the same. I’ll say it again: The Republican and Democratic parties are not the same.\nI don’t just mean they believe different things. I mean they’re composed in different ways, they argue from different premises, they’re structured in different ways. We treat them as mirror images of each other — the left and right hands of American politics — but they’re not. And the ways in which they’re different make it hard for them to understand each other, and hard for American politics to function.\nPolitical scientists Matt Grossmann and Dan Hopkins literally wrote the book on how the parties are different. In Asymmetric Politics: Ideological Republicans and Group Interest Democrats, they argue that the differences between the parties stem from a central and longstanding split in the country’s political personality: We are a country of philosophical conservatives, and policy liberals. We want a small government that does more of everything.\nI asked Grossmann on the show to walk me through the ways the parties are different, and how those differences explain everything from the GOP’s repeated shutdowns to asymmetric polarization to the rise of Fox News. This is a conversation about the fundamental structure of America’s parties, public opinion, and media institutions. It’s worth the time.\nBook Recommendations:\nRacial Realignment: The Transformation of American Liberalism, 1932-1965by Eric Schickler\nBefore the Storm: Barry Goldwater and the Unmaking of the American Consensusby Rick Perlstein\nLaw and Order: Street Crime, Civil Unrest, and the Crisis of Liberalism in the 1960's by Michael W.
