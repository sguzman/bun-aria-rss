  "description": "<p>John reacts to the Chiefs getting a lackluster MNF win over the Giants, if there's cause for panic over Patrick Mahomes continued poor play, and why it's clear Daniel Jones just isn't an NFL starter.

He also explains why UCLA's hesitancy to fire Chip Kelly shows how unserious the Pac-12 is about football, also answers listener questions in the Middlekauff Mailbag!</p><p><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/3-and-out-with-john-middlekauff/id1352730623\">Subscribe NOW</a>!
