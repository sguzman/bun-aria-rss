Your body handles long nights, limited sleep, and poor diets much easier. The problem is those choices have a cumulative effect. What you eat, how often you eat also impacts the health of your brain. There is a Chinese proverb that says, “the best time to plant a tree was 20 years ago, and the second best time is now.” It is easy to disregard neurodegenerative diseases as something for older people, but understanding how leaky brain and neurodegeneration begins to happen is better learned now, than waiting till later if you plan to age gracefully. Dr. Jay Lombard may be incognito but his depth of knowledge and expertise in degenerative neurological diseases is astonishing. He breaks down what misfolded proteins are, the relation of infection and immune system processes to neurodegenerative disease and reveals simple ways you can support your immune system on a cellular level.
