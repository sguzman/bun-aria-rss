  "description": "Daniel just returned from a trip to Arizona… and has some interesting observations about the labor shortage in airports. [0:35] While on his trip, Daniel was able to speak with business owners involved in construction and real estate… He shares some insight on these sectors… and explains why inflation will get much worse before it gets better. [5:30] Automakers continue to deal with semiconductor shortages and supply chain issues… but Tesla seems to be bucking this trend. Quite frankly, some of the bearish price targets on Tesla seem ridiculous. Daniel and I discuss whether sell-side analysis is meaningless in today’s investing world… and Daniel divulges which automaker he’d buy right now, and why (hint: it involves politics). [22:30] As bitcoin prices jumped over $50k, JPMorgan CEO and famous bitcoin skeptic Jamie Dimon took yet another dig at the asset’s “intrinsic value.” Daniel and I examine the “intrinsic value” argument… and highlight why you don’t need to worry about the U.S. banning crypto anytime soon—and why you need exposure to bitcoin… [25:25] And for an easy way to add crypto to your portfolio, make sure to check out my  advisory. We’ve got some massive winners in the portfolio—I’m talking in the triple and quadruple digits—with more room to run. [33:00] Enjoyed this episode?
