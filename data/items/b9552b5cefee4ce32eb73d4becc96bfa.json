    "media:description": "We were really excited to get a chance to talk with Dr. Tecumseh Fitch! Dr. Fitch is an evolutionary biologist and cognitive scientist who received his PhD from Brown University, and is now a professor in the Department of Cognitive Biology at the University of Vienna. Heâ€™s published extensively on the evolution of speech, language, and music, and is the author of the 2010 book The Evolution of Language.\n\nIn our interview, we discussed the following topics:\n- his recent research on whether it's anatomy or neurology holding back monkeys from speech\n- his thoughts on Darwin's hypotheses about how language may have evolved\n- how to come up with good hypotheses about how language evolved, given that it doesn't leave fossils\n- what he believes is different about humans that led to the development of language\n\n... and more! Thanks again to Dr. Fitch for speaking with us.\n\nHis book, The Evolution of Language, can be found here: http://www.indiebound.org/book/9780521677363\n\nYou can find links and PDFs to a lot of his work in the piece here on his website:\nhttp://homepage.univie.ac.at/tecumseh.fitch/publications/\n\nFitch's article on monkey vocal tracts:\nhttp://advances.sciencemag.org/content/2/12/e1600723\n\nThe Mark Liberman post on this topic: \nhttp://languagelog.ldc.upenn.edu/nll/?p=29735\n\nFitch on Darwin's musical proto-language hypothesis:\nhttp://homepage.univie.ac.at/tecumseh.fitch/2010/08/05/musical-protolanguage-darwins-theory-of-language-evolution-revisited/\n\nOur previous interviews:\nSali Tagliamonte: https://youtu.be/tapgQNcKuFo\nAnne Charity Hudley: https://youtu.be/xKjrnrsiKv4\nLisa Pearl: https://youtu.be/EOfGgqPeeC4\nDaniel Dennett: https://youtu.be/30eOI6pL-lU\nSteven Pinker: https://youtu.be/piJBmPh5jFU\n\nFind us on all the social media worlds:\nTumblr: http://thelingspace.tumblr.com/\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/TheLingSpace\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/thelingspace/\n\nAnd at our website, http://www.thelingspace.com/ !\nYou can also find our store at the website, http://thelingspace.storenvy.com/\n\nWe also have forums to discuss this interview, and linguistics more generally.\n\nLooking forward to next time!",
