  "description": "<p>Oh what a beautiful morning! Oh what a beautiful day! I got a beautiful feeling a long lost sister is coming Melissa Gorga's way! Yes, \"The Real Housewives of New Jersey\" have trotted off to OOOOOOKLAHOMA where the sprinkle cookies come sweeping down the plain. And even better: we finally get to see some real fractures in the Melissa/Teresa relationship, whose rosy future is as unlikely as a farmer and a cowman being friends. The real breakout of the episode, however, was Jennifer, who proved to be a girl who cain't say no... to being an ASSHOLE. Ben and special guest Danny Pellegrino (filling in for Ronnie) have some strong thoughts about The Chanel Queen of Paramus, and we suspect many a new day may have to come before we change our opinions on her. So jump on your horse and take a trip with us to O-K-L-A-H-O-M-A OKLAHOMA!!! Capiche??<br />\n<br /><hr /><p>See <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://acast.com/privacy\">acast.com/privacy</a> for privacy and opt-out information.</p><p><a href=\"https://patreon.com/watchwhatcrappens\">Our Patreon Extras: https://patreon.com/watchwhatcrappens</a></p></p>\n",
