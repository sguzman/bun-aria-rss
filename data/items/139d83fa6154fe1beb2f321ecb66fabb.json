  "description": "<p>Coming to us from a literal underground opal mine in Australia, it's actual icon and genuine world treasure Alan Cumming!!! What?! And! Anyone that thinks you can't pull together a top notch Las Culturistas episode with a guest on the other side of the damn globe?! Eat it! We talk the recent Eurovision victors, what Pride means lately, the need to choose fun over darkness in both life and work, highlights of working on Spice World, Spy Kids, X2, Cabaret and Josie and the Pussycats, how Americans really don't understand camp, directing the amazing new scripted podcast Hot White Heist starring one BOWEN YANG (heard of her?!), being a playable character in the Goldeneye video game on N64, creatively visualizing the upcoming Shmigadoon, going to a nude beach with Ian McKellen, how Los Angeles is sort of like Hershey, Pennsylvania if you think about it, how children's theater changed Alan's life, not wanting to talk about acting or hang out with actors, and the haven that is Club Cumming. Listen to Hot White Heist now!!!
