  "description": "Georgia got whooped. Notre Dame got whooped. Michigan State got whooped. Tennessee has given the reins to Whoopin Recipient Specialist Brady Hoke. The Playoff Committee might be in for a whoopin. Syracuse's defense got whooped. Oh, there's also some audio we left in here from when Spencer had to reset his whole computer so Jason and Ryan invent a movie about a man going back and re-making all of the same mistakes. Weirdly, this movie is not called \"What If Georgia Plays Auburn Again In The SEC Championship?\"\nLearn more about your ad choices.
