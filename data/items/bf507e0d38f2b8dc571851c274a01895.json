She opens up about her huge shootout goal, the endless tour after winning the gold, whether there was any fear that USA Hockey would challenge the Women's Team boycott threat, the sick OT save by Maddie Rooney that saved their bacon, and much more. RA and Whits open up with the crazy KHL thread that went viral overnightÂ on Wednesday, the David Backes suspension, Ron Francis getting kicked upstairs, and the NHLPA players poll. They finish up with #ARH questions and some Oscar talk.</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
