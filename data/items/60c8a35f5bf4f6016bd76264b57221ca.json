  "description": "<div>Hi Friends!<br>\n Hope you are having a wonderful day today so far. Today I wanted to talk about Tim Mclean and what in the world happened to him on the greyhound bus. The whole story is strange.<br>\n  I hope the family and passengers get the justice they deserve but most of all are able to heal and move forward. Love and appreciate you guys so much and I hope to be seeing you very soon<br>\nxo<br>\nBailey Sarian </div>\n",
