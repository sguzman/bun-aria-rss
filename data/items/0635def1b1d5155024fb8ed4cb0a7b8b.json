  "description": "<p><em><strong>Understanding the Bible: Part Ten. Genre</strong></em>. Today, we discuss genre and how it should inform our approach to the text. How is the Bible like a Barnes & Noble? And, therefore, how do we enter into it? How does cultural and time/era specific language direct our understanding?</p>\n<p>Mike walks us through the book of Revelation as an example of genre taken out of context.</p>\n<p>The complexity of the text is on display and it’s asking us to wrestle with it, to marinate in its mystery and wonder at God’s intentional back and forth with all of us. It’s beautiful in all of its chaos and intricacy.</p>\n<p>As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
