  "description": "It’s easy to go through life holding on to things that are weighing us down—guilt, resentment, worry and doubt. These things naturally come. The problem is that when we allow them in, they take up space for the good things that should be there.In this message, Joel will show you how your life is like a container that God created to be filled with joy, peace, confidence, creativity and much more! But if you allow worry in, it pushes out peace and all the good things God longs to deposit in you. Learn how to apply David’s prayer in Psalm 103:5 in your life—“God fills my life with good things. So that I stay young and strong.” Discover the condemnation and guilt tactics the enemy tries to launch at us and how to stay on the offense.As you empty out the negative in your life, God can fill your life with good things. He’ll give you beauty for ashes, joy for mourning, and you will have peace in the midst of any storm.<p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
