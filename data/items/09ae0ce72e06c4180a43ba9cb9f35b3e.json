In a ridiculous Marie Antoinette moment, Biden eats ice cream, says \"Our economy is strong as hell.\" Buttigieg gives totally out-of-touch answer on economy. Buck says, \"It's an upside-down world that Pete Buttigieg and they all live in.\" Dems heading for historic defeat. Red Tsunami warning! Herschel takes it to Warnock in debate. Clay warns \"sophisticated\" voters who like to vote-split for usually acceptable reasons that, in this case, \"A vote for Raphael Warnock is a vote for Joe Biden... the worst president of our lifetimes.\" Biden speaks nonsense about his sister's age, smells another woman's hair.<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
