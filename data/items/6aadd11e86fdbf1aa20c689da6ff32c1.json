  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, President Trump called the entire State of New Hampshire a \"drug-infested den\" in 2017 — a state that is 90% Caucasian.  The media is reluctant to report these facts because it rejects the idea of a utopian state. This ideology strips the individual of his individual identity and assigns people a new group identity, so as to put them into a group or class. But instead, what we saw in last night’s debate was history and liberty being diminished; there was once a time when candidates for President celebrated America instead of trashing her. \n\nThe diabolical genius of Marxism-Socialism is that it provides the emotional and intellectual roadmap for autocrats to persuade millions of people to support their own enslavement to government. Later, Rep. Tulsi Gabbard clashed with Sen. Kamala Harris claiming that President Trump is a de facto supporter of Al Qaeda.  After, the media is focusing on an indefensible statement by President Ronald Reagan. Despite the comment being appalling, one statement by someone who's actions and life clearly showed us that he was not a racist. In fact, Reagan signed Dr. Martin Luther King Jr.'s birthday into law as a federal holiday.  Finally, Bill Gertz calls in to discuss China trying to prevent Trump from being re-elected in 2020.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
