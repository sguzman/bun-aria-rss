The first is ‘Self-Directed Retail Investors,’ who has bootstrapped crypto from the ground up. The second is ‘Institutional Investors,’ including Venture Capital Firms, Endowments, Foundations, and other large funds. The third – and most neglected – is capital under the ‘Financial Advisor’ umbrella. This is where the 1%-er money is, and this bucket is just now gaining access to the crypto space.</p> <p>The Financial Advisor bucket holds $30-$40 Trillion in assets, and the minds in this space are changing as crypto is increasingly legitimized through improving infrastructure and the strong recovery from the 2017 cycle. Building efficient vehicles to bridge this wealth into crypto is critical for large-scale adoption.</p> <p>This is where Bitwise comes in. Bitwise manages around $1 Billion in assets and created the first Crypto Index Fund, offering a variety of products to retail investors, accredited investors, and financial advisors. Most recently, Bitwise launched its DeFi Crypto Index Fund, exposing financial advisors to the world of DeFi. Analogues to Legacy Finance like Price-to-Earnings Ratios and Cash Flows make DeFi compelling and understandable, but DeFi is showing itself to be “cheaper, more efficient, more open, more transparent, [and] more verifiable.”</p> <p>------<br /> RELEVANT LINKS:</p> <p>Matt on Twitter:<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/Matt_Hougan?s=20\">https://twitter.com/Matt_Hougan?s=20</a> </p> <p>Bitwise:<br /> <a href= \"https://www.bitwiseinvestments.com/\">https://www.bitwiseinvestments.com/</a> </p> <p>Matt's CFA Report on Cryptoassets:<br /> <a href= \"https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/article/rf-brief/rfbr-cryptoassets.ashx\"> https://www.cfainstitute.org/-/media/documents/article/rf-brief/rfbr-cryptoassets.ashx</a> </p> <p>Makerburn<br /> <a href= \"https://makerburn.com/#/\">https://makerburn.com/#/</a> </p> <p>------<br /> 📣REGISTER FOR COINDESK CONSENSUS 2021 AND SAVE $20 W/ BANKLESS<br /> <a href= \"http://bankless.cc/consensus2021\">http://bankless.cc/consensus2021</a> <br />  ------</p> <p>CATCH UP ON BANKLESS:</p> <p>🗞️ Weekly Rollup (2/26): <a href= \"https://shows.banklesshq.com/p/-rollup-big-dip-nft-culture-coinbase\"> https://shows.banklesshq.com/p/-rollup-big-dip-nft-culture-coinbase</a> <br />  🧢 Weekly Action Recap (2/28): <a href= \"https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/weekly-action-recap-f41\">https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/weekly-action-recap-f41</a> <br />  📈 Market Monday (3/1): <a href= \"https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/\">https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/</a> <br />  🎙️ Podcast with Mark Cuban (3/1): <a href= \"https://shows.banklesshq.com/p/-why-defi-is-the-future-mark-cuban\"> https://shows.banklesshq.com/p/-why-defi-is-the-future-mark-cuban</a> <br />  🐦 Follow Bankless on Twitter: <a href= \"https://twitter.com/BanklessHQ\">https://twitter.com/BanklessHQ</a> </p> <p>-----<br /> Not financial or tax advice.
