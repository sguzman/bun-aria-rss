  "title": "Cutting edge: Valuation of spread commodity structures",
  "description": "In this paper, Dan Mahoney and Krzysztof Wolyniec show that in co-integrated (mean-reverting) futures markets, active dynamic hedging is required to realise the quadratic variation of the underlying spread process. Using static hedges/portfolios yields significantly different values from those available with dynamic strategies no matter what risk adjustment/penalty is adopted. The implications for pricing, hedging and optimal trading strategies in commodity markets are discussed",
