  "title": "91 - The Ma Barker Gang! Ruthless 1930s Killers",
  "description": "<p>The Ma Barker gang robbed bank, after bank, after drugstore, after hardware store, clothing store, Chevy dealership, jewelry store, and still more banks in the early 1930s. They committed more robberies and took more lives than the much more famous Dillinger Gang. The Dillinger Gang was active for less than one year. The Barker-Karpis gang was active from 1931 to 1935. FDR called them out on national radio during one of his famous fireside chats, referring to them as “an attack on everything we hold dear”. FBI Director J Edgar Edgar Hoover described Ma as \"the most vicious, dangerous and resourceful criminal brain of the last decade\". But, was she really their leader? Or was she just along for the wild ride?
