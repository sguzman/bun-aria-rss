  "description": "Joe Weisberg and Joel Fields have spent five years at the helm of The Americans, the '80s-set spy series which many (Todd included) would call TV's best drama. And somewhat fittingly for a show about an arranged marriage made for business purposes, the two were pushed together in the early days of the show, when Weisberg (the show's creator) needed a steady hand to help him learn the ropes of running a big TV show. Usually, these sorts of creative marriages collapse quickly, but Weisberg and Fields have thrived. Todd talks with them about learning to work together, the rise of Russia in the headlines, and the show's most recent (and next-to-last) season.\n      \n      \n      \nLearn more about your ad choices.
