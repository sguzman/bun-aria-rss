  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, General Michael Flynn's Attorney Sidney Powell joins the program to discuss the breaking news that the DOJ has dropped their charges against Flynn after internal FBI memos showed a bias toward harming Flynn. In fact, there was never even a legally-sound reason to investigate Flynn, to begin with. This is evidence of a culture of corruption that has damaged the leadership level of the FBI during President Barack Obama's tenure. These bad actors must be pursued to make sure these kinds of political prosecutions and the soft coup against a duly elected President never happens again in the United States. Then, according to Byron York, newly declassified court papers show that during the Presidential transition, top Justice Department official Sally Yates learned about the Flynn-Kislyak phone call from President Obama himself. Former Attorney General Sally Yates, FBI Director James Comey, Director of National Intelligence James Clapper, and Vice President Joe Biden met in the White House with Susan Rice for a meeting of the National Security Council in January 2017. Yates and Comey stayed behind after this meeting to discuss how the Logan Act might be used on General Flynn. The meeting ended with President Obama allegedly saying \" don't tell me anymore\" suggesting Obama wanted to have plausible deniability.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
