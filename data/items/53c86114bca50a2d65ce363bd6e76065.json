  "description": "<p>We investigate what quantum advantages can be obtained in multipartite\nnon-cooperative games by studying how different types of quantum resources can\nimprove social welfare, a measure of the quality of a Nash equilibrium. We\nstudy how these advantages in quantum social welfare depend on the bias of the\ngame, and improve upon the separation that was previously obtained using\npseudo-telepathic strategies.\n</p>\n<p>Two different quantum settings are analysed: a first, in which players are\ngiven direct access to an entangled quantum state, and a second, which we\nintroduce here, in which they are only given classical advice obtained from\nquantum devices. For a given game $G$, these two settings give rise to\ndifferent equilibria characterised by the sets of equilibrium correlations\n$Q_\\textrm{corr}(G)$ and $Q(G)$, respectively. We show that $Q(G)\\subseteq\nQ_\\textrm{corr}(G)$ and, by considering explicit example games and exploiting\nSDP optimisation methods, provide indications of a strict separation between\nthe social welfare attainable in the two settings. This provides a new angle\ntowards understanding the limits and advantages of delegating quantum\nmeasurements.\n</p>",
