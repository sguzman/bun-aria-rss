  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Why does marriage feel so hard in the little years? After pouring your energy and brain power out for your kiddos, it’s easy to offer your spouse the leftovers. In this episode, Emily and Laura invite some very special guests on the show to talk about marriage with little ones: their husbands, Brad Jensen and Mike Wifler! Dates may look different, conversations may constantly be interrupted, and serving one another may look mundane, but the gospel can breathe new life into marriage. The gospel story reminds  us of God’s faithfulness as he works in our hearts—and the joy of partnering with others in the process.</span></p> <p id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1566331294262_1463\"><em><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">We’re grateful to Crossway for making this week’s show possible.
