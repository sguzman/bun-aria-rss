  "description": "Welcome back to another episode of Frankly Speaking! Today's first question covers stop-loss orders - an investment tool I will always strongly recommend. At times investments fall out-of-favor... and we are forced to sell. It happens to everyone. But what should investors look for when they want to re-enter? Then, after giving listeners a quick update on the uranium company - Cameco (CCJ)... I explain why dividend-cuts are not always necessarily a bad sign for shareholders. Switching gears, I then share some tips for listeners who are new to the world of investing. If you plan on being a \"day-trader,\" this is a must listen. And finally, to end the episode, I break-down another \"buy\" recommendation. And why investors should act now - before the storm. Special thanks to Kevin, Daniel, Thomas, Mike, and John. Keep the questions coming! Other stocks mentioned: GoldMining (BRI.V), Sandstorm Gold (SAND), Kinder Morgan (KMI), KKR & Co L.P. (KKR), Delta Airlines (DAL), and International Business Machines (IBM) Also, don't forget to tune-in next week! I'll be recapping everything I learned from the 2017 Consumer Electronic Show. Talk to you then and good investing! Frank Curzio",
