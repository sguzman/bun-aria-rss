  "description": "New York Attorney General Letitia James files a blatantly political, frivolous civil lawsuit against Trump. Buck says, \"I think Letitia James wants to be AG-AG. Just to be clear.\" Clay's analysis: \"As soon as I saw that this was civil and not criminal... I just immediately said this is a billion percent political designed to put Trump on the ballot in the midterms.\" Dems will stop at nothing to stop Trump from becoming president again. Will Merrick Garland bring criminal charges against Trump before the election, right after the election, or not at all? When will Trump announce he's running? C&B call him a \"scorned man\" with sights on Trump, who is the reason he's not on the Supreme Court. Are Democrats going to knock out Trump and get a potentially harder opponent to beat like DeSantis? Clay and Buck talk to an enthusiastic caller on their evolving Hunter Biden bet and ask for his input.<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
