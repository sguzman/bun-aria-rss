  "description": "In Just Around Midnight: Rock and Roll and the Racial Imagination (Harvard University Press, 2016), Jack Hamilton examines major American and British recording artists of the 1960s to explain what happened during the decade to turn rock-n-roll white. By pairing musicians such as Sam Cooke and Bob Dylan or The Beatles and Motown, Hamilton explores the connections among artists and how artists influenced each other across racial and musical distinctions. Hamilton’s well-researched text seeks to expand how we think about the rock and roll canon and challenge how we think about music during the time period. He explores the ways in which rock and roll critics rebranded rock and roll as white and promoted and sold it as authentic to fans. Hamilton’s book challenges the racial categories of authenticity in the 1960s, and challenges readers to hear music differently.\n\n\n\nRebekah Buchanan is an Assistant Professor of English at Western Illinois University.
