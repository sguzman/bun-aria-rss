  "description": "Today’s episode brings you a totally new set-up: Dr. Becky in the guest seat. In anticipation of something *very special* coming to your shelves this September, Dr. Becky’s book editor Julie Will steps into the role of host to share the full story behind “Good Inside: A Guide to Becoming the Parent You Want to Be.” As Julie asks what inspired the book, how it differs from other parenting resources, and where the “Good Inside” philosophy began, Dr. Becky’s passion for thinking about parents, kids, and family systems will light you up, too. You’ll learn the full story behind her journey from practicing “behavior-first” parent coaching to creating the Good Inside framework—including her “aha” moment in the middle of a session—and why she believes there’s no one “right” way to parent. Yes, this is an episode about Dr. Becky’s book… and it’s also so much more. It’s the story of a paradigm shift in how we understand ourselves and our kids. It’s the story of a growing movement.<p/>\n<p/>\nAvailable on September 13.
