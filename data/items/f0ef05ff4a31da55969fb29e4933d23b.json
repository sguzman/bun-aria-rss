  "description": "<p><p>Kirk Minihane has had it with the Minifans. In the middle of his Culture War, when they're supposed to be prank calling other radio shows, generating content, and embarrassing his enemies, they are instead obsessing like nerdy high school kids over Blind Mike's fake groupie. Enough. Also on today's show: Fox News apologizes after The Daily Wire's Michael Knowles calls Swedish environmentalist Greta Thunberg a \"mentally ill six-teen-year-old,\" the boys re-cap the premier of Bob Hearts Abishola, and The Emmys fall to the lowest rating ever recorded. </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
