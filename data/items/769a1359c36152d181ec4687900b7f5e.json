  "title": "Can't Help Falling in Lauv (the interview)",
  "description": "This week, Charlie talks to Lauv, the singer, songwriter and producer behind unfailingly catchy tracks such as “Mean It” and “I Like Me Better.” Lauv’s a master at making the sad feel fun—masking themes of anxiety and betrayal with upbeat, percussive production. He even does a bit of the opposite, too, by infusing his joyful songs with vulnerability and emotional complexity. You’ll soon be able to hear all of that and more on his debut studio album, ~how I’m feeling~, out later this week. Our conversation explores Lauv’s song-making process and touches on everything from T Swift (Lauv counts himself a fan), “mind” rhymes, and the particular nuances of loneliness in the internet age. Today’s episode also features the voices of some of our wonderful listeners--special thanks to Katy, Sadie, Robert, Genevieve, Keen and everyone else who wrote in with questions for Lauv.\nSongs Discussed:\n\nLauv with Anne-Marie - fuck, i'm lonely\n\nLauv & LANY - Mean It\n\nLauv - I Like Me Better\n\nLauv & Troye Sivan - i’m so tired...\n\nLauv - Changes\n\nLauv - Modern Loneliness\n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
