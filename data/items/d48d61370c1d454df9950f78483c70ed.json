  "description": "Thumbelina's life is already difficult. She lives in early modern Denmark and is no bigger than her mom's thumb. Oh, and also, everyone wants to marry her. And by everyone, I mean everyone. Frog moms want her to marry their sons and, somehow, the story gets stranger from there. In true Hans Christian Andersen fashion, this fairy tale for children about a girl being born from a flower and trying to find love contains kidnapping, death threats, crushing nihilism, and sleazy moles. Childhood was different back in the 1800s. The creature are shrimp fries! But you have to act now or they'll be gone...oh, wait...no. My bad. They died 200 years ago. --- Sponsor: The Great Courses Plus. I'm currently loving The Celtic World. Check it out...or check out ALL the courses for free for thirty days.
