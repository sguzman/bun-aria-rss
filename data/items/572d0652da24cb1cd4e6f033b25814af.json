  "description": "On Friday’s Mark Levin Show, Mr. Call Screener and ‘This Is America’ podcast host, Rich Valdes fills in for Mark Levin. Democrats have perfected being the loud, squeaky wheel and getting what they want even if it’s not what the majority wants. Most Americans aren’t radical Marxists like Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez or Bernie Sanders, most Democrats aren’t radical like them either and actually like America. When Kamala Harris takes international trips and fumbles like she did in Guatemala, we know we’re screwed. We have the Commander of weak in the White House, so Kamala has to lead and it’s not working out. Biden keeps giving us more reasons to laugh, first saying white supremacy is the greatest threat, only to change it to global warming. Also, Americans across the country are beginning to stand up to our kids from being indoctrinated by Critical Race Theory in schools. Mothers are speaking up and becoming champions for their communities, raising their voices against school boards pushing CRT. Moms are taking back America to defeat CRT and save the future of this republic.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
