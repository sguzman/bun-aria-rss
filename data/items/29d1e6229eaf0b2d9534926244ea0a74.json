  "description": "<p>Even though there are likely going to be fewer individuals actually going shopping in person the Friday after Thanksgiving this year, Black Friday is still a majorly important time for deals. These days Black Friday has transcended time and place- it includes multiple days and even an entire season of scoring really low prices on gifts. This can provide some relief to our bank accounts as we search for gifts for friends and family for less than we can normally get these things the rest of the year. But on the flip side of the coin, this time of year can really strain our personal finances. There’s the temptation to overspend and consume more than we need to and because of this, many American’s end up with boatloads of debt come January. There are a number of different problems that arise during this consumption-driven time of year. In this episode we highlight some of these ‘Black Friday Foibles’, why they’re a big deal, and then we discuss what to do about them.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Caliente Aqui by Tripping Animals!
