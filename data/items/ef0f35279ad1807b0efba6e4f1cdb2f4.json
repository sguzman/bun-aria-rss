  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">For <strong>Life on Purpose Episode #84</strong>, my guest is internet entrepreneur, coach, traveler, and financial freedom enthusiast <strong>Tal Gur</strong>. He joined me for a great and in-depth conversation on his new book \"<em><strong>The Art of Fully Living-1 Man. 10 Years. 100 Life Goals.</strong></em>\"</p> <p class=\"p1\">Shortly after turning 30, <strong>Tal</strong> himself these following questions: <em>\"Imagine knowing you had only 10 years to live - Would you change your life? How?\"</em></p> <p class=\"p1\">Inspired by a late-night conversation with friends, and disillusioned with the trappings of \"making it\", he then drafted a list of 100 goals to achieve in a decade.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Through relentless focus, he traded his daily grind for a life of his own daring design as a location-independent entrepreneur and coach.</p> <p class=\"p1\">He tackled financial, physical, and spiritual dreams one by one: mastering English in pulsing Melbourne, completing Ironman New Zealand, creating financial independence, surfing at the world’s most sought-after beaches, and rebuilding a Peruvian family’s flood-ravaged home, among other adventures.</p> <p class=\"p1\"><em>\"What makes a life fully lived? Comfort? Conventional success? For me, it’s all about the thrill and satisfaction that come from a continuous quest for adventure and self-discovery.\"</em></p> <p class=\"p1\"><strong>About Tal:</strong></p> <p class=\"p1\">My story has been written from many perspectives and been enriched by the people and places I've encountered along the way.</p> <p class=\"p1\">After leaving school, aged 21, I embarked on a long motorcycle trip in Australia & immediately fell in love with this remote, vast and spectacular corner of the world. I went back to my home country to pursue a bachelor's degree but the memory of that epic trip never left me.</p> <p class=\"p1\">In 2003, after several years working in the high-tech world and feeling there was something missing, I decided to change direction and follow a lifelong dream of mine: living and studying in Australia.</p> <p class=\"p1\">In late 2005, being inspired from the sheer enjoyment that came from pursuing my Australian dream, I made a conscious decision to pursue every big dream I have ever had. I started a long life goals list and gave myself 10 years to be completely finished with this project.</p> <p class=\"p1\">After a few blissful years in Melbourne, Australia, I sold everything I had, packed a small backpack, and left on a one way ticket to Nepal. This trip turned to be a fateful encounter, eventually leading me to leave my stable job, become an online entrepreneur, and travel and live abroad in various countries for more than than 6 years.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Ever since I remember myself I was intrigued with the endless possibilities of self-expression. I simply see life as a playground to express our deepest desires and experiment with the perceived limits of the physical world.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Looking at my life, I have come to realize that my life is not just one linear continuous journey but more as a recollection of different journeys and experiences.</p> <p class=\"p1\">I've learnt that it is definitely not all about the destination, but more about the journey. And the greater the challenge, the more satisfying it is.</p> <p class=\"p1\">Since my move to Australia, being inspired from the satisfaction and sense of achievement that came from pursing my Australian dream, I found myself constantly seeking new challenges, overextending myself in all aspects of life, ultimately resulting in very happy and fulfilling journeys.</p> <p class=\"p1\">To learn more about <strong>Tal</strong>, visit: <a href=\"https://fullylived.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">https://fullylived.com/</a>.</p>",
