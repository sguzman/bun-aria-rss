  "description": "<p>On this Very Special Episode Recorded LIVE at The House of Blues Houston, The 85 South Show’s Karlous Miller, D.C. Young Fly, and Chico Bean deliver a improv comedy show with a live band that will go down in history. These incredibly talented stand-up comedians combine forces to roast everybody in the audience including the lady who works at IHOP, the truck driver with the cowboy boots, the lesbian in the durag with the missing teeth and especially the two women in the diamonds and the hats. From Oprah’s OWN Network and The Steve Harvey Morning Show, Nephew Tommy pops the show off with a New Year’s celebration and brings that OG funk the 85SouthShow is known to embrace.
