  "title": "Ep. 868 - The BLM Riots Were A Million Times Worse Than January 6th",
  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Carcast, yesterday’s January 6th festivities were as insufferable as expected. We’ll take a look at some of the lowlights. Also, we'll compare January 6th to the BLM riots of 2020 to see if we can determine which was worse. It’s not hard to determine because the competition isn’t close. Also, Nancy Pelosi told one of the most egregious lies we’ve heard from a politician in quite some time, which is saying something. And Russia has a plan to ship pedophiles off to penal colonies in the Arctic. Plus, Morgan Wallen survived his cancellation and went on to have the number one best selling album of the year. So why am I canceling him anyway today? We’ll talk about all of that and much more on the Matt Walsh Show. \nSign the petition to stop Biden’s vaccine mandate.
