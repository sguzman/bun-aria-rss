Statham plays a bank truck driver who may be more than he appears.  Expect lots of bodies, blood, and nastiness.  But is it a fun watch?  Then it’s the Russell Crowe led thriller, ‘Unhinged’.  Crowe does his version of the Michael Douglas/’Falling Down’ thing.  But is the cranked-up-to-11 nastiness rob of the film of its potentially pulpy charms?  There’s the always riveting rundown of the big releases on Physical Media, featuring the Straight to DVD and Streaming Picks of the Week.  Then the show closes with The Lady Wan and Chris sharing some of their favorite Action Films Currently Streaming.
