  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">Christianity Today editor, Mark Galli, has taken a shot at Donald Trump and his evangelical supporters heard around the world. He’s called for Trump’s removal and for evangelicals who continue to defend the president’s immorality and corruption to consider the damage they are doing to the reputation of the church and its mission. Holy Post listeners asked for our perspective and we’ve heard your cries. Phil, Skye, and Christian are here to discuss the fallout of Galli’s editorial, media coverage of the event, and to help put it all in context.</p>",
