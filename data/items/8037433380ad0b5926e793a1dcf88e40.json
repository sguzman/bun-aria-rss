  "description": "<p>The Therapy for Black Girls Podcast is a weekly conversation with Dr. Joy Harden Bradford, a licensed Psychologist in Atlanta, Georgia, about all things mental health, personal development, and all the small decisions we can make to become the best possible versions of ourselves.</p>\n<p>Are you looking for something new and insightful to add to your bookshelf? The Therapy for Black Girls Library has got you covered. Since so many of our community members love a good book, we'll be sharing interviews with the authors of some books we think you'll enjoy in these TBG Library episodes.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This week we&rsquo;re reading <em>Truth's Table: Black Women&rsquo;s Musings on Life, Love, and Liberation</em>. Truth&rsquo;s Table is a collection of essays and stories documenting the lived theology and spirituality we need to hear in order to lean into a more freeing, loving, and liberating faith&mdash;from the hosts of the beloved Truth&rsquo;s Table podcast. For this conversation I was joined by co-authors Dr. Christina Edmondson and Ms. Ekemini Uwan. We chatted about the creation story behind the book, how they managed the vulnerability required to write, their expansive ideas about faith and sprituality, and how they want this book to impact readers.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Where to Find Truth's Table</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://bookshop.org/a/20534/9780593239735\">Grab your copy of Truth's Table</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://truthstable.com/\">Website</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/truthstable\">Facebook</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/truthstable/\">Instagram</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/truthstable\">Twitter</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Stay Connected</strong></p>\n<p>Is there a topic you'd like covered on the podcast?
