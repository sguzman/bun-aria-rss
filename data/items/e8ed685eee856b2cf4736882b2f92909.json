How do you even <strong>get to 100 units </strong>when it’s already challenging enough to get one? That answer is simple: <strong>stack them slowly over time</strong>. That’s exactly what today’s guest, <strong>Erika Sleger</strong>, did. Erika heard about <strong>house hacking </strong>from a lecture in college, so once she graduated she decided to <strong>buy a fourplex, live in one unit, and rent out the others</strong>.</p><p>She learnt some valuable skills from that first fourplex and later sold it for a nice profit, <strong>1031 exchanged it into an 18 unit</strong>, and started collecting rent. From there, she <strong>used her equity on the 18 unit to buy a 64 unit</strong>.
