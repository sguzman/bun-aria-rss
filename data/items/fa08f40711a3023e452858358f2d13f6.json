  "description": "Nick Kostos, Pete Prisco, Will Brinson and Jason La Canfora break down everything that happened in Week 7 across the NFL, including a dominating effort from Ezekiel Elliott and the Dallas Cowboys (3:59), the Saints winning their fourth straight against the Aaron Rodgers-less Packers (9:44), the Panthers struggling offense (13:17), and the Jaguars imposing defense (19:37). The guys continue their recap, discussing if the Steelers are the best team in the NFL (24:51), where the Seahawks fit in that conversation (27:20), and if the Chargers can actually make noise in the AFC West (30:36). Of course the guys hit on the suffering Browns (37:48), the coaching effort in Buffalo (47:08), and a not-so-good 4-2 Dolphins team.\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
