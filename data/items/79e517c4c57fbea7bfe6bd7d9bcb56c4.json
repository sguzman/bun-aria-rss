  "description": "<p>Julie Carr married my dad, Frank Ryan in 1960, and had me two years later. My sister, Beth, was born four years after that. While raising us, she worked as a teacher in Middle and High Schools and in various administrative positions. She's smart, sweet, and a hell of a mom. She doesn't do social media, bless her heart, but you can leave her messages when you order swag from \"the cottage,\" as many of you have done over the years -- much to her delight.</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find me on</span> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thatchrisryan/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instagram</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or</span> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThatChrisRyan\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twitter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p> <p><a href=\"http://chrisryanphd.com/support\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Please consider supporting this podcast.</span></a></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/site-directory/ref=as_at/?imprToken=L0dx1bytKTIFKxXSPyxqDw&slotNum=0&imprToken=9z4hfRiNxmPSo-xbL1UP9w&slotNum=23&&_encoding=UTF8&tag=seatda-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=f16530c77f77aa7b0fbec39c58a049a1&camp=1789&creative=9325\"> This Amazon affiliate link kicks a few bucks back my way.</a></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intro music: “Brightside of the Sun,” by <a href=\"https://basinandrange.bandcamp.com/track/brightside-of-the-sun\">Basin and Range</a>; \"All Along the Watchtower,\" by Bob Dylan; \"Smoke Alarm,\" by <a href=\"https://www.carsieblanton.com/\">Carsie Blanton</a>.</span></p> <br/><br/>This is a public episode.
