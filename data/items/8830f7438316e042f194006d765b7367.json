Unlocking and even mining that negative cycle, though, was the key to her turnaround.</p><p>She started down a path of discovery that would lead to a series of serendipitous adventures, eventually becoming a leading voice in the world of design, branding and media, and co-founding and chairing the Masters in Branding Program at the School of Visual Arts in New York.
