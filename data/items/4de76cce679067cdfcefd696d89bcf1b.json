  "description": "Whenever you’re having a bad day, I want to think of this number…the probability of you existing—that you’re this sentient being, alive in this vast universe—is exceedingly small…in fact, it’s about zero…\n\nYour mom and dad have to meet…they have to stay together long enough to have kids…then that egg and that sperm have to connect, and so on…\n\nA guy by the name of Dr. Ali Binazir has calculated the odds of you being you…by that number is 1 followed by 2,685,000 zeroes…\n\nBy way of analogy, here’s how he describes it…\n\nImagine there was one life preserver thrown somewhere in some ocean and there is exactly one turtle in all of these oceans, swimming underwater somewhere. \n\n The probability that you came about and exist today is the same as that turtle sticking its head out of the water — in the middle of that life preserver. On one try.\n\nMind-boggling, right?...now let’s get even weirder…add in the chances of you getting into a band that becomes successful…and not just successful, but a group that becomes world-changing…add another six zeroes to that last number…\n\nNow consider this: what if you got into a second successful band that stays together for decades and also becomes one of the biggest things rock has ever seen…that’s good for, what, three more zeroes?...\n\nSo in this completely unscientific extrapolation of Dr. Binazir’s estimation of the uniqueness of existence, the chances of Dave Grohl being Dave Grohl is approximately one in two quadrillion, 685 trillion…give or take…\n\n \n\nThis is the third and final part of our ultra-deep look at the guy…\nLearn more about your ad choices.
