  "description": "This week, I sat down with legendary Texas wildcatter and president of Chisholm Exploration, Cactus Schroeder. If you’re not familiar, Cactus is one of the smartest men you’ll find in the oil business. For 40 years, he’s drilled around the most prominent basins of North America... including involvement in over 1,000 drilling projects. In this episode, Cactus and I discuss the hardships going on in the oil industry right now... And why there’s more short-term pain ahead. We also take a look at oil prices and talk about what needs to happen before drillers become profitable again. [22:16] Regular listeners know I’ve been bearish on Disney for a few months now. In my educational segment, I break down why I’m still bearish on this massive media company, and why I believe it could fall hard from current levels.
