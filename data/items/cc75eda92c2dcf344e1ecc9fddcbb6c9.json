  "title": "Ep 209 | Phil Robertson's '15-Year Jail Sentence,' Social Media Lies, and Why Judas Sold Out Jesus",
  "description": "Phil still isn't a CBD oil exec, but is he serving 15 years in prison? Facebook hasn't fact-checked it yet, so it must be true. Jase has a theory about why the scam artists picked Phil's face for the CBD hoax. Phil considers the influence of the Father of Lies, Al talks about the Parler shutdown and where we're headed, and Zach points out the kingdom work being done online. Jase has been censored for \"sensitive\" content before, but he's pumped about his Jesus ground game. And the guys discuss the Holy Spirit as the ultimate ace card, why Judas betrayed Jesus, and why seeing miracles isn't enough to save someone.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
