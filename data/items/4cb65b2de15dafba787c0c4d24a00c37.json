A story that lays bare the indelible power of the human spirit to face and transcend unimaginable, seemingly insurmountable obstacles and ultimately transform one's life wholesale.</p><p>If you're a longtime listener, Johnny Bloodclot&nbsp;needs no introduction. For the uninitiated, John is a sui generis American original. The very definition of hardcore. A survivor. A spiritual warrior spouting straight talk directly from the streets of the Lower East Side with one singular, driving purpose:</p><p>getting people to wake the f&*k up.</p><br><p>Conceived and raised in abuse, deprived of opportunity and left to his own devices, John turned to violence and drugs on the rough and tumble streets of New York's Lower East Side in the 1970’s. It's a path that predictably led to violence, crime, addiction and incarceration. Spending his teens as a drug mule led to a series of unsavory foster care homes, culminating in unimaginably horrific stints in juvenile detention.</p><p>Then things went downhill.</p><p>To avoid long-term incarceration, he enlisted in the Navy, only to go AWOL after a fight. Fleeing the law and rudderless, John found redemption in the hardcore punk rock scene flourishing on Manhattan's Lower East Side in the early 1980's. Taken in by the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bad_Brains\" target=\"_blank\">Bad Brains'</a> frontman H.R., John began to explore not just his musicianship, but his spirituality.&nbsp;It's a journey that birthed the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cro-Mags\" target=\"_blank\">Cro-Mags</a>&nbsp;– one of the era's most iconic and influential hardcore punk bands. Later, he found his spiritual salvation living in a Hare Krishna monastery, birthing a life-long love of meditation, yoga, the vegan lifestyle, racing Ironman triathlons, and most importantly, his profound devotion to service.</p><p>Renown for his straight talk, no BS approach to living and the power of PMA —&nbsp;positive mental attitude — John continues to tour as frontman for both Cro-Mags&nbsp;and his new band&nbsp;Bloodclot.&nbsp;He also just released a 2nd edition of his memoir&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0998344702/ref=as_li_qf_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ricroloffweb-20&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0998344702&linkId=30392e046e187aac5187d3df7725a288\" target=\"_blank\">Evolution of a Cro-Magnon*</a>&nbsp;and is the author of nutrition primer&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0062320327/ref=as_li_qf_sp_asin_il_tl?ie=UTF8&tag=ricroloffweb-20&camp=1789&creative=9325&linkCode=as2&creativeASIN=0062320327&linkId=d3b6254d347a242f049a9897c5d4a1a7\" target=\"_blank\">Meat Is For Pussies*,</a>&nbsp;with a foreword by yours truly.</p><p>A man who truly walks his talk, every conversation with John leaves me better than before.
