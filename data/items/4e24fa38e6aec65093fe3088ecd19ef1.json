The gang also goes deep into nostalgia with classic consumer electronics.\nBut we couldn’t leave it at that. Paul interviews our own senior reporter Bryan Bishop, who calls in live from San Diego Comic-Con to tell us what he’s seen so far at the convention. To top it all off, we go into the nerdiest part of the celebrity feud between Kayne West and Taylor Swift, which leads to the cast going through their own note-taking apps.\n08:20 – Softbank buys ARM\n24:45 – Paul’s \"Gadget shhecrets\"\n29:20 – EFF copyright lawsuit\n37:40 – Nostalgia note\n44:24 – SDCC interview with Bryan Bishop\n56:26 – Taylor Swift / Kanye West / Kim Kardashian feud\n1:02:57 – Note app game\nLearn more about your ad choices.
