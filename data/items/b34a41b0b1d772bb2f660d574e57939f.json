  "description": "Lala had a weekend and is still recovering! But luckily she’s spilling a bit of tea about her travels to Mexico to see Scheana & Brock tie the knot, what she really thinks about her own social media game, and why honesty is so important when it comes to pictures and image! She shares stories about her beach baby, Ocean, and how she plans to raise her when it comes to alcohol, drugs, sex, and religion. And Lala’s back to re-watching Housewives and has some thoughts on the badass but classy Garcelle Beauvais and a few words to those trashing Lisa Rinna.\nSTAY CONNECTED\nCall Lala at 424-255-9131\nInstagram: @givethemlalapodcast\nLearn more about your ad choices.
