They were demanding political freedoms and calling for an end to what they said was years of discrimination by the Sunni monarchy that rules the country. Rob Walker spoke to Asma Darwish, a 20 year old student who joined the protests.\n\nPhoto: Demonstrators in Manama. Credit: Reuters/Caren Firouz.",
