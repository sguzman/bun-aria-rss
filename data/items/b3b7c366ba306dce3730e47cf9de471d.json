  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, former Ambassador Marie Yovanovitch testified in secret, behind closed doors, today that she was asked to leave by the Trump administration. What the reports leave out is that she was recalled by the President because she was an Obama-era holdover. It is the President's prerogative to hire and fire ambassadors just like they do with U.S Attorney's. What's more problematic is that the media did not object to her secret testimony or the fact that President Trump's counsel was not able to interview her in public or in private, despite her being a disgruntled former diplomat that was fired by Trump and she never once filed a whistleblower complaint. Similarly, Ambassador Kurt Volker was questioned in secret and no one seems to bat an eye. Yet, just three months ago these same Democrats were trying to declassify secret grand jury information and now they are trying to impeach the President in secret. Then, the so-called whistleblower who had a professional relationship with VP Joe Biden also served as a source leaking information to two aides on Chair Adam Schiff’s staff. This is a Soviet-style railroad operation behind closed doors that won't allow the president to defend himself or face his accuser in public. Later, Turkey claims to inadvertently have fired on U.S Special Operations troops despite their knowledge of our troops' location along the Syrian border. The U.S Military on the ground responded that US troops unambiguously retain the right to defend themselves in situations like this. Afterward, Fox News legal analyst, Gregg Jarrett, joins the show to discuss his new book, \"Witch Hunt: The Story of the Greatest Mass Delusion in American Political History.\"\nLearn more about your ad choices.
