  "title": "#75: Stop Disrupting Childhood (Bret Weinstein & Heather Heying DarkHorse Livestream)",
  "description": "<p>In this 75th in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens.  In this episode we discuss privacy, and the amazing things that we (and you) can see with game cameras: beaver, river otters, nutria, coyotes. Then: should children be allowed to medically and surgically transition? One approach to understanding our answer is to consider type-I vs type-II errors in statistics. And: shall we drug children to get them to fit with modernity (specifically, a new ADHD drug)? What helps breed “persistence” in children? On a different topic: on the villainification of Jordan Peterson by Ta-Nehisi Coates. Finally: sunlight really is the best disinfectant (of SARS-CoV2). <br/><br/>Our book, A Hunter-Gatherer’s Guide to the 21st Century, is now available for pre-sale at amazon.
