  "description": "Rotten Tomatoes gives \"National Lampoon's European Vacation\" a score of 39 percent.  But if they had rated \"Donald Trump's European Vacation\" the score would have been a lot lower--especially if they were listening to our panel.  Rosa Brooks of Georgetown, Kori Schake of Stanford, Susan Hennessey of Lawfare and David Rothkopf of somewhere in New Jersey, join for a play-by-play breakdown of the president's trip, gaffes, missteps, and outrages.  Suffice it to say Chevy Chase would have done better...even the old, cranky, not-funny-anymore Chevy Chase of today.  Also explored on this episode: the very big idea of a Kori Schake-Graham Allison cage match over the use of the term \"Thucydides Trap.\"  Deep State Radio Nerd heaven!
