  "description": "<p>Using a shortcut way we have derived the Fokker-Planck equation for the\nLangevin dynamics with a generalized frictional memory kernel and\ntime-dependent force field. Then we have shown that this method is applicable\nfor the non-Markovian dynamics with additional force from harmonic potential or\nmagnetic field or both of them. The simplicity of the method in these complex\ncases is highly noticeable and it is applicable to derive the Fokker-Planck\nequation for any kind of linear Langevin equation of motion which describes\nadditive colored noise driven non Markovian dynamics with or without frictional\nmemory kernel. For example, one may apply the method even for the linear system\nwith an additional colored Gaussian noise which is not related to the damping\nstrength. With these the present study may get strong attention in the field of\nstochastic thermodynamics which is now at early stage to consider the\nnon-Markovian dynamics.\n</p>",
