  "description": "<p><p>The best way to cap off 2018 is a jam-packed episode with two interviews, and live reaction to massive military news. General Mattis is no longer on the president's staff, so we give you our rapid reaction live from our radio show. Chaps and Kate interview Dr. Janette Nesheiwat about the best things to send in a care package, and Cons interviews college basketball announcer Chris Spatola about going from West Point to the basketball court. We also introduce a new format with quick fire topics that you won't want to miss!!! </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
