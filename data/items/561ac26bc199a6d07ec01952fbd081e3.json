  "description": "<p>This week we're breaking down The Return. This is the second episode in the two episode arc with Traveling Salesmen, and you know we have more memories from Greg Daniels for you. We're also joined by the hilarious Ed Helms, who shares his memories of this episode, including Andy's ringtone and punching that wall. Then, we talk about Oscar's return to Dunder Mifflin, Dwight working at Staples, and we get another fan rendition of Heartbreak In The Breakroom by Carmen and Camille. Finally, we get a good Homer Simpson background catch, chat about Jim and Pam’s prank on Andy, and dig into the Micheal-Dwight bromance moment of this episode. Rit dit dit dit doo! </p>\n",
