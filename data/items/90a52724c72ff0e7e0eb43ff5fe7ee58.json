They also go through the Folder of Death and chat about whether or not Hamilton on Disney+ is any good, the difference between Sandhill Cranes and Loons, a couple of board games that didn't make the cut from last episode, one of the greatest tv game shows of all time, SuperMarket Sweep, and what one dish they would make for Guy Fieri if they were trying to get him to tell them the food was gangster. Keep sending in your questions to&nbsp;@ThePodPMI on Twitter and Instagram. Enjoy.</p>\n",
