  "description": "On Friday’s Mark Levin Show, Nancy Pelosi enlisted Democrats and Liz Cheney to form a committee to investigate facts around the so-called insurrection of January 6th. They will not investigate what Nancy Pelosi and Mitch McConnell knew and when they knew it and what the FBI knew and when they knew it and why they didn't inform the White House of the intel they had ahead of January 6th. Former Dept. of Defense Chief of Staff, Kash Patel, asks why DC Mayor Bowser rejected thousands of troops when Trump offered them. Meanwhile, to investigate threats to members of Congress the Capitol Police is opening field offices in Florida and California. Interestingly, this is the only police force in America that is getting more funding, not being defunded. This federal police force is allowed to keep its qualified immunity. Congress now has a national police force that no one has voted on. Later, some critics will say that being a patriotic activist is violent, but this program has never called for violence - we condemn it! Yet, the left never repudiated the violent riots of 2020, the arson on federal buildings, and criminality plaguing Democrat-run cities. Not a single Constitutional conservative has supported the January 6th riots or any other form of violence, unlike the Marxists. Then, there is no guarantee that we can save America even if we're all united but we won't know until we try. The Democrats despise a free America and it's our job to expose the American Marxists. Just like in the days of the American Revolution there's a third of the country that wants to restore freedom, a third that wants to change it, and a third that just doesn't care. Americans must use politics to achieve their goal. Afterward, Democrats continue to spread the lie that Republicans are suppressing the votes of minorities. They spread the lie that they want all to vote but it's really all about a quest for power. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
