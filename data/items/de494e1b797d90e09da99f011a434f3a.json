  "description": "Donate to St. Jude as part of our Draft-A-Thon! Bid on pre-draft calls with our experts, a spot in our Podcast League, a guest spot on our show and more! https://ebay.to/3p4Dc3Z\nIf young quarterbacks like Justin Fields, Trey Lance, Tua Tagovailoa and Trevor Lawrence make big leaps in 2022, this could be the deepest QB season we've had in a while. But even if they don't, you'll have plenty of great options at the position. We start with an overview of the position and then some fun stats (4:26) about recent QB history and where the Top 2 finishers at the position are usually drafted. Then we get into your news and notes (7:30) with an update on Deshaun Watson and Matthew Stafford ... Let's talk strategy (14:00)! The guys give their basic strategies and tell us which tier they usually draft from. We also cover how strategies change in different formats (25:30) including Superflex (33:00). Then it's time for sleepers (36:10), breakouts (41:00) and busts (44:00). We love Lance this year. Don't overlook Jameis Winston in deeper leagues. Beware of Joe Burrow at his average draft position ... Running through ADP and discussing all of the relevant QBs (51:00). We debate Jalen Hurts vs. Kyler Murray. We wonder why people are concerned about Tom Brady. We discuss the upside for Tua and Lawrence. And we end the show talking about Mac Jones and Davis Mills! They were better in 2021 than people realize ...
