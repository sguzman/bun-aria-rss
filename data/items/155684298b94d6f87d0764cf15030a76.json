  "description": "He’s not punching in at the DMV or collecting litter on a roadside. He’s helping the U.S. to develop responsible technology that can both ensure equitable access to the tools that will enable our future and win our government rulemaking rights over high tech like artificial intelligence and facial recognition.\nIf that sounds a little intense, that’s because it is. But if anyone’s up for the job…?\nIt’s Eric Schmidt, former CEO and executive chairman of Google. He’s seen the best and worst of both the public and private sectors. Now, he’s talking about the intersection of the two—how they improve one another, accelerate one another...and occasionally butt heads with one another.\nThere are countless reasons why we’re having this conversation right now, but to name a few:\n\nThe 2020 presidential election is a few short weeks away, and it’s a huge test for Big Tech’s supposed efforts to protect our democratic process. \n\nOur economy is getting more automated each day—who gets to make the calls as the robots roll out?\n\nChina. Tech war. Enough said.\n\nSeems like everyone, from Big Tech in Silicon Valley to lawmakers in D.C., has an interest in owning the tools of the next generation.
