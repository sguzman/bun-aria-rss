  "description": "If you've found yourself confused by the twists, turns and competing narratives around the Committee on the Scottish Government Handling of Harassment Complaints then firstly, you are not alone and secondly, this is the briefing you've been after. Mandy Rhodes is the Managing Editor of the brilliant Holyrood Magazine, the fortnightly trade paper for Scottish politics. Mandy takes through the details step-by-step and explains all the different elements: the remit of the committee, the issues the committee has faced, the context of The Crown Office intervention and the dynamic between the current First Minister and her predecessor. It's also an honest account on the pressures journalists face in getting to the truth, especially in an environment where power and friendships overlap.
