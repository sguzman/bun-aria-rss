  "description": "<p>Spoke to the eyewitness and he said “I live in Tennessee near the Smoky Mountains. A good friend of mine lived out in the country and asked me to come over because he was sure there was howler monkeys in the woods behind his home.</p> <p>I was curious so I went to see if I could hear these “howler monkeys” that he was talking about. After several nights of being out there we heard strange vocalizations but never saw anything until the last couple of nights. We have rocks thrown at us and we saw two of them. One of them was huge, biggest thing I have ever seen and it reminded me of a human covered in hair but it was a really big human. There was one night we saw something, I think unrelated and it was so strange I don’t know what to think. It is so odd I am not sure if I want to discuss it, stranger than Bigfoot.”</p> <p>The eyewitness has agreed to come on the show and share his encounter.</p>",
