  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, an innocent man in Minnesota was killed by a bad cop. Ninety-nine percent of cops, of all races in all communities, are great patriots and many of them are disgusted by this terrible killing. George Floyd has a knee on the back of his neck with the full weight of the officer upon his throat. It’s important to note that, the full strength and resources of the county prosecutor, the police, the DOJ, the FBI, the AG, and the President all took immediate steps to address this incident without delay. This case is indefensible, it’s open and shut and should be handled meticulously so that it doesn't get botched and that Floyd gets justice. Then, is Twitter prevented from posting what it wants or from allowing its users to post what they want? No. However, Twitter has moved from its mission as a neutral community platform for user-generated content to a curator of political content. Per Congress' Communications and Decency Act of 1996 protects Twitter as a platform under section 230 of that bill, but now they are changing. Of course, Twitter is free to do what it wants, it’s a private corporation, so, the 1996 law no longer applies to Twitter since they changed their mission and are no longer an open platform. Finally, Pete Hegseth calls in to discuss his new book: American Crusade: Our Fight to Stay Free.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
