  "description": "<p><p>Fastest 2 Minutes for NFL Week 8. We recap every single game on Sunday. Pete Carroll mercy kills Dan Quinn, Matt Nagy is a buffoon, Matt Stafford is on the MVP list, Drew Brees is back, Andy Reid vs clock management, the Patriots D is incredible, the Niners are a wagon, Jon Gruden is negging Derek Carr, and Gregg Williams is  the most relatable idiot in the world. Who's back of the week including Halloween and Tiger. Football guy of the week. PFT cursed the Nats and we got to see Tits on the screen in the World Series plus a special Monday Reading of the PMT group text and the case of the drunk tweet. </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
