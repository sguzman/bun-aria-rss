  "description": "The beginning of the story of Jason and his legendary Argonauts doesn't start with Jason, but with Zeus being...well, Zeus, and kidnapping an unsuspecting woman. There is a dragon, a giant bronze robot, and court intrigue, leading to some familiar names coming back to help Jason travel to a faraway land and obtain the golden fleece. Those names include Hercules, Theseus, Laertes (father of Odysseus), Autolycus, Peleus (the father of Achilles), Augeus (with the legendarily dirty stables), and more. It's the biggest meetup of everyone we've met so far...well, everyone that isn't in Hades (Sisyphus) tied to a rock (Prometheus) or wandering blind through a plain (Bellerophon). The creature looks so much like a normal person it's uncanny. I mean, he looks like a normal person once you get past his humorously big ears, nose, and hands. And his gray skin...that sometimes glows. Ok, he looks nothing like a normal person.
