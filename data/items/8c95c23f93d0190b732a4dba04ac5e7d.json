What better time to discuss abusive nephews and ham slapping? The Real Housewives of Atlanta in Miami was a doozy this week. Fights, social commentary, and super bitchy remarks by Tootie’s mom Docker wearing husband. Then we head over to Vanderpump Rules, where people finally learn to be nice to LaLa after they realize they’re boyfriends will be leaving them for Vegas trips until the end of time.
