  "description": "<p>How comfortable are you sharing your art? Are you one of those people who shares regular videos or blog posts? Or do you tend to shy away from being public about your work? Alice is preparing to launch an exciting new visibility challenge and that sparked a discussion about the importance of this facet of our art careers. It's simply not enough to just make wonderful art - we also have to put it out into the world and that means putting ourselves out there too. The truth is that people buy art from artists they can connect with and they can't connect with you if they've never seen you. In this episode we discuss some of the blocks to visibility and share our own thoughts on the importance of making ourselves visible.</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>Find out about Alice's Time to Shine Alice's challenge :<a href=\"https://www.soulrocketstudio.com/shine\" target=\"_blank\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.soulrocketstudio.com/shine\" target=\"_blank\">www.soulrocketstudio.com/shine</a></p>\n<p>or on her website here: &nbsp;<a href=\"\">https://alicesheridan.com</a><br>\n</p>\n<p>This is my House <a href=\"\">https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m000tjfz/this-is-my-house</a></p>\n<p>The Cleaner <a href=\"\">https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episode/p09pm3dv/the-cleaner-series-1-1-the-widow</a></p>\n<p>Find our websites and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/\">www.alicesheridan.com&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p>@alicesheridanstudio</p>\n<p>@louisefletcher_art</p>\n<p>Credits: \"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n",
