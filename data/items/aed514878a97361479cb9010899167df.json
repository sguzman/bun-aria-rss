  "title": "A Pediatric Neurosurgeon Shares Stories From The O.R.",
  "description": "Dr. Jay Wellons regularly feels the exhilaration of saving a child from near certain death — and sometimes the anguish of failing to prevent it. He's operated on various parts of the pediatric central nervous system, including performing spine surgery on an in-utero fetus to correct spina bifida. He says he has a big book of photos and mementos from his patients that he pulls out whenever he needs to be lifted up or grounded. \"I will always pull that file out and just flip through it and just think, 'This is why we do what we do,'\" he says. He also talks about how the overturning of <em>Roe v. Wade</em> will impact pregnant women whose fetuses have neurological defects. His new memoir is <em>All That Moves Us</em>.<br/><br/>Also, rock critic Ken Tucker reviews the new album from Bartees Strange.",
