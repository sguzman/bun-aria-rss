  "title": "The Martian by Andy Weir",
  "description": "The Martian follows the main character Mark Watney, as a space accident leaves him stranded on Mars, while his crew members escape. The book details his impending doom as Mark tries to find the best method for his survival, with the story, following his trials and tribulations along the way. What I liked about this book was the author's use of Mark's first-person perspective. Chapters in the book were broken down into log's which followed Mark's journey and survival efforts during his time on Mars. The humour that the author puts into the characterisation of Mark makes the story compelling as the reader is surprised by the optimism that he shows in the face of adversity. The author's use of technical knowledge regarding equipment used in space travel elevates the narrative as well as the storyline. I enjoyed reading this book as it had a right mix of humour, optimism and hope. I rate this book four stars. \n\nOMBR\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
