  "description": "It’s comforting to imagine killers behind bars. But what if they get loose? Some could be lurking around your neighborhood, or even be that dark shadow outside your window. Today’s stories are all about killers… close to home. First, join Markeia as we watch some live coverage of a murderer gone loose. Next, we’ll order some odd-tasting ice cream from a disgruntled employee. After that, we’ll take a dip in the pool at a road-side bed and breakfast. And finally, we’ll visit a small town and get in deep with some bad kids. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
