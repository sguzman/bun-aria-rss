  "description": "God has a great purpose for your life! He has marked you as a person of influence on this earth. Just by you being the best you can be, you are making an eternal difference. You are part of God’s plan and you are helping to move the kingdom of God forward.At times, we can’t necessarily see our gifts and talents. We don’t understand how we can be used to influence others. I think about Moses in the wilderness for 40 years. He was raised as Egyptian but as a young man he made some mistakes and acted out of anger. He ended up fleeing to the wilderness where God appeared to him as a burning bush and said, “I have an assignment for you.” Moses was afraid and felt unworthy but God knew exactly who Moses was. He said, “I’m doing a work and I want you to lead it. I choose you to lead my people.” Moses literally pleaded with God. He didn’t think he could carry out the assignment. He was thinking about his past. He focused on the fact that he stuttered. He didn’t feel equipped at all. But God said, “I’ve been shaping you from the beginning.” Moses ultimately surrendered to God and God used Moses in a powerful way.Even though Moses couldn’t see what God had placed in His life, Hundreds of years later after Moses died they said, “Moses was educated in all the wisdom of the Egyptians and was powerful in speech and action” (Acts 7:22, NIV). That was a far cry from the way he saw himself!This is an excellent reminder to us that it’s up to us to mix our ability with faith and let God have His way even when we don’t understand how He can use us. We have to put one foot in front of the other and let Him lead us into His plans and purposes. You may not see what’s in you right now, but just like Moses, God does. He is at work in you! Remember, you are a person of purpose and influence and God is using you in powerful ways in the earth!<p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
