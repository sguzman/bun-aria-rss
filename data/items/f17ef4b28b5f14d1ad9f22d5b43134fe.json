  "description": "Our audiobook this week is HIS MIMOSA by Jamie Schlosser! \n\nNarrated by Mackenzie Cartwright & Matthew Maddux\n\nCarter doesn’t believe in love at first sight or happily ever after. When he goes to Vegas for his brother’s bachelor party, the last thing he expects is Brynne, the beautiful cocktail waitress who nurses his hangover with a drink just as bubbly and sweet as she is. Brynne’s optimism and unfailing faith in love is a breath of fresh air, and it makes him think maybe he’s had it wrong all along. They say what happens in Vegas stays in Vegas. And Carter’s heart? It might be taking up permanent residence there.\n\nMAGIC MAN by Jamie Schlosser (Kindle Unlimited): https://amzn.to/2JEXKvS\n\nOUTCAST by Jamie Schlosser (Kindle Unlimited): https://amzn.to/2WBY2Jg\n\nJamie Schlosser Giveaway!: http://readmeromance.com/books/jamieschlosser/\n\nFollow Read Me Romance on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/readmeromance/?hl=en\n\nJoin Read Me Romance Headquarters on FB: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1681258945313004/\n\nFind Alexa Riley on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/authoralexariley/\n\nFind Tessa Bailey on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/tessabaileyisanauthor/\n\nPodcast Credits\nRead Me Romance Theme Song by L.B.
