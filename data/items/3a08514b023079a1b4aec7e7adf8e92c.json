  "description": "2011-10-19 - Divine Abodes: Compassion - We cultivate compassion by letting ourselves be touched by the suffering within and around us.  Because our conditioning is to avoid vulnerability, the path of compassion requires courage and purposefulness.  As we awaken to the truth of our connectedness, our hearts become increasingly tender and our actions serve the healing of our world.
