  "description": "<p>In this 80th episode of Philosophy Bakes Bread and our 14th \"breadcrumb\" episode, Eric Thomas Weber and Anthony Cashio invite Dr. Erin Tarver back on the show to talk with us about a great listener voicemail that we received from Julia from New Hampshire. We call this breadcrumb episode \"The Good, the Bad, and the Ugly of Sports Fandom.\" </p> <p>Erin was our guest in episode 31 of the show, titled \"<a href= \"https://www.philosophersinamerica.com/2017/07/31/035-ep31-sports-fan-i-am/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Sports Fan I Am</a>.\" She is the author of <em><a href=\"http://amzn.to/2ucP4C8\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The I in Team: Sports Fandom and the Reproduction of Identity</a>. </em>In that episode, she raised the following question for our listeners near the end of the episode: “Should colleges and universities even be in the business of organizing ‘minor league’ sports teams?” In her voicemail, Julia responded that although she is a sports fan and was an athlete in college, her feminism raises concerns for her about the adversarial quality of sports competitions, among other concerns. Erin offers us a rich response.</p> <p>Listen for our “You Tell Me!” questions and for some jokes in one of our concluding segments, called “Philosophunnies.” Reach out to us on Facebook <a href= \"https://www.facebook.com/philosophybakesbread/\">@PhilosophyBakesBread</a> and on Twitter <a href= \"http://twitter.com/PhilosophyBB\">@PhilosophyBB</a>; email us at philosophybakesbread@gmail.com; or call and record a voicemail that we play on the show, at 859.257.1849.
