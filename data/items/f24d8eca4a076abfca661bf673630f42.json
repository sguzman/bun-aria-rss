For good reason. It&#8217;s stunning.</p>\n\n<p>Well, now there are multiple competitors. I just spent some time messing with the latest one that has a ton of hype, called <a href=\"https://www.midjourney.com/showcase/\">Midjourney</a>.</p>\n\n<p class=\"callout\">Midjourney is macOS and DALL-E is the Linux CLI.</p>\n\n<p>The obvious question for both beginners and experts is, &#8220;What&#8217;s the difference?&#8221;</p>\n\n<p>The easiest way to answer that is to say that Midjourney is like using a Mac. And DALL-E is like using the Linux command line. This is true in three main dimensions:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>Ease of Use: Midjourney does better with simpler prompts.</li>\n<li>Weaker But Safer: Midjourney is less powerful, but does better if you are lazy.</li>\n<li>A Bias Towards Beauty: Midjourney produces better-looking output with very little effort</li>\n</ol>\n\n<div id=\"attachment_138156\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-138156\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://danielmiessler.com/images/midjourney-showcase.png\" alt=\"midjourney-showcase\" width=\"650\" height=\"629\" class=\"size-full wp-image-138156\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-138156\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Some samples from the Midjourney Showcase</p></div>\n\n<h2>Examples</h2>\n\n<p>I just wrote another post for the site about censorship vs. company autonomy, and I wanted to use Midjourney to make the blog header image. I used the prompt:</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=0></div>\n\n<blockquote>\n  <p>An art piece showing the violence between internet censorship vs. free speech.</p>\n</blockquote>\n\n<p>Here&#8217;s what DALL-E gave me:</p>\n\n<div id=\"attachment_138160\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-138160\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://danielmiessler.com/images/dalle-censorship.png\" alt=\"dalle-censorship\" width=\"650\" height=\"157\" class=\"size-full wp-image-138160\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-138160\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Interesting but not immediately compelling</p></div>\n\n<p>And after only a few minutes from research to creating, I got this from Midjourney:</p>\n\n<div id=\"attachment_138162\" style=\"width: 660px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><img aria-describedby=\"caption-attachment-138162\" decoding=\"async\" loading=\"lazy\" src=\"https://danielmiessler.com/images/midjourney-censorship.png\" alt=\"midjourney-censorship\" width=\"650\" height=\"353\" class=\"size-full wp-image-138162\" /><p id=\"caption-attachment-138162\" class=\"wp-caption-text\">Midjourney&#8217;s attempts at the same prompt</p></div>\n\n<p>I have tried some other queries where I went from basic to extremely nuanced DALL-E queries (vs. Midjourney), and I was able to get DALL-E to win. But it took a lot of time. A lot of trial and error. Midjourney gets to something very cool with very little prompt engineering.</p>\n\n<p class=\"callout\">It&#8217;s like DALL-E was trained off of all art, and Midjourney was trained off of <em>Deviant Art</em>.</p>\n\n<p>It&#8217;s almost like Midjourney was trained off of images that people already love, whereas DALL-E can generate much more, but with a correspondingly larger Margin for Meh. To say that another way, I&#8217;ve made a million DALL-E images that were total throwaway misses. With Midjourney, almost everything you make is at least a little bit cool.</p><div data-inline-related-post data-inline-related-post-index=1></div>\n\n<h2>Interface differences</h2>\n\n<p>The other big difference is that DALL-E is run from a full website or via API. Midjourney on the other hand is run via Discord bot. It&#8217;s an interesting choice, and likely a brilliant one. It&#8217;s basically taken over the mindshare within the gaming world very quickly, with so many people there being 1) inclined towards pretty looking DeviantArt-like images, 2) not super interested in reading a 75-page prompt engineering book, and 3) already highly familiar with Discord.</p>\n\n<p>Bottom line: you <strong>have</strong> to go play with this thing. So:</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li>If you&#8217;re a hardcore AI and/or Art person, you should be messing with DALL-E first and Midjourney second.</li>\n<li>If you&#8217;re light on the AI stuff and more interested in gaming or NFTs or just having cool art for various purposes, start with Midjourney.</li>\n</ol>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://midjourney.com/showcase/\">>> View the Showcase</a>\n<br />\n<a href=\"https://midjourney.gitbook.io/docs/\">>> Get Started with Midjourney</a></p>\n</p>"
