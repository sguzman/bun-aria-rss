  "title": "Super Bowl LV Preview & Bold Predictions: Could Chiefs vs. Bucs be highest-scoring matchup ever? (Football 2/4)",
  "description": "The Pick Six Superfriends have been making bold predictions all postseason, and that doesn't stop on this episode. But Will Brinson, Ryan Wilson and John Breech also layer in some relatively normal predictions for Super Bowl LV. Of course, Breech first targets a kicking prop & prediction. Wilson shows love for an old Pick Six centerpiece, Sammy Watkins. And Brinson thinks the Honey Badger (or Tyrann Muh-thigh-eww as John would say) is poised for a big night. The most points ever scored in a Super Bowl is 75, and one of our guys think that record is in jeopardy. They also think one of Jerry Rice's longstanding records could fall on Sunday.
