  "description": "In A. K. Sandoval-Strausz’s recent work, Barrio America: How Latino Immigrants Saved the American City (Basic Books, 2019), ties together a magnificent story of Latinos migrating to Chicago and Dallas, and the positive effect immigration and cultural heritage has on urban America. Latinos are often viewed on the sidelines of societal transformation; however, Sandoval-Strausz situates the Latino experience at the center of national discussions taking place with white flight, 1965 Immigration Act, Immigration Reform and Control Act of 1986, and the 2016 Presidential Election. Sandoval-Strausz finds that throughout the twentieth century, Latinos rise to middle and professional classes, become homeowners, and own businesses. More than that, Sandoval-Strausz dives into a discussion of political coalition-building, transitional cities, and the ingenious ways a Latino urbanism developed in the late twentieth and twenty-first century. By incorporating oral histories, photographs, and archival research, Sandoval-Strausz’s discussion of Latino contributions will change the way people view the Windy City and the Big D. Take a seat and turn the volume up, Tiffany speaks with Andrew Sandoval-Strausz about his new work that combines Latino Studies and Urban History in this episode. You don’t want to miss this.\nTiffany Jasmin González is an American Association of University Women Fellow and Ph.D. candidate of History at Texas A&M University. Her dissertation, Representation for a Change: Women in Government and the Chicana/o Civil Rights Movement showcases the political labor that Latinas conducted to shape American government in the late twentieth century and twenty-first century.  You can follow Tiffany on Twitter @T_J_Gonzalez.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
