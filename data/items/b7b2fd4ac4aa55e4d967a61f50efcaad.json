  "description": "In today's podcast, we hear that the SEC was hacked, and someone might have made a lot of money from the incident. Equifax tweets send inquirers to a phishing site. Investigation into the Avast caper suggests a state intelligence service's hand. The Department of Homeland Security clarifies its ban on Kaspersky products. Emily Wilson from Terbium Labs, cautioning us to not be so distracted by big shiny objects like \"taking down the power grid\" that we forget the basics, like enabling two-factor authentication. Richard Henderson, global security strategist at Absolute, commenting on the Equifax breach and the challenges of keeping up with patching. And chatbots turn spiritual. \n    Thanks for listening to the CyberWire. One of the ways you can support what we do is by visiting our sponsors. Recorded Future's user conference RFUN 2017 comes to Washington, D.C. , October 4th and 5th, 2017, bringing together the people who put the act in actionable intelligence.
