  "description": "<p>Episode 30 doesn’t disappoint. It’s quite a doozy, so don’t say we didn’t warn you. Christine shows off her (very limited) knowledge of the steel industry when Em tells her about the Sloss Furnaces, an extremely terrifying and haunted landmark in Birmingham, AL. Meanwhile, Em is haunted by more disembodied feet and Christine’s lame dad jokes.<br />Then, Christine finally bites the bullet and tells the tragic tale of Sylvia Liken’s death. (Don’t blame me - you guys asked for it!) All we can say is, you think it can’t get any worse, and then it does.<br />This episode is sponsored by Coke/Dope.*<br />*Not really.
