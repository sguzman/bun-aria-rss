  "description": "<p>Shocking footage of a so-called \"comfort zone\" in downtown Boston (brought to you exclusively by the Kirk Minihane Show) reveals the sordid conditions that political leaders in Massachusetts have created for the most vulnerable members of society. Will any one ask Gov. Charlie Baker and Mayor Marty Walsh how this fits with their coronavirus strategies? Blind Mike has led the Gearheads to war against radio host Thom Hartmann, an old rival of S.E. Robinson (0:29:00). A new shake up in the wacky world of Boston radio doesn't inspire (0:59:00). Saturday night is trivia night and Minihane will be pitted against a Minifan who kind of looks like Matt Damon from Team America.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
