Now you're applying to a job and notice one of your obscure connections is VP of the company. <strong>Is it tacky to contact them?</strong></li>\n<li>If you genuinely love networking and meeting new people, you might feel bad about having to turn down lunch with some of them because you just don't have as much time as you used to (especially when they turn into sales pitches in disguise). <strong>How do you retreat from these invitations politely?</strong></li>\n<li>If you're <strong>proud of your political activism in college</strong>, does it do any harm to bring it up when you're looking for a new job?</li>\n<li>Should you <strong>give up all the guaranteed benefits of your long-term government job to pursue a shaky future in the private sector</strong> that could result in more money and reemergence of happiness from that fire and drive you once had, but at a time cost and a possibility of being released or fired and losing those needed benefits for your family?</li>\n<li>Since returning to your hometown as a successful attorney making the big bucks, <strong>one of your friends seems to think you should pay for everything you do together</strong> because you make more money.
