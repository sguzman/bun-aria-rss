  "description": "<p>Conventionally the mobility edge (ME) separating extended states from\nlocalized ones is a central concept in understanding Anderson localization\ntransition. The critical state, being delocalized and non-ergodic, is a third\ntype of fundamental state that is different from both the extended and\nlocalized states. Here we study the localization phenomena in a one dimensional\nperiodically kicked quasiperiodic optical Raman lattice by using fractal\ndimensions. We show a rich phase diagram including the pure extended, critical\nand localized phases in the high frequency regime, the MEs separating the\ncritical regions from the extended (localized) regions, and the coexisting\nphase of extended, critical and localized regions with increasing the kicked\nperiod. We also find the fragility of phase boundaries, which are more\nsusceptible to the dynamical kick, and the phenomenon of the reentrant\nlocalization transition. Finally, we demonstrate how the studied model can be\nrealized based on current cold atom experiments and how to detect the rich\nphysics by the expansion dynamics. Our results provide insight into studying\nand detecting the novel critical phases, MEs, coexisting quantum phases, and\nsome other physics phenomena in the periodically kicked systems.\n</p>",
