  "description": "<p>Between you and this podcast, we are recording at an ungodly hour in the morning which makes things a little extra silly. Nikki begins with realizing that she was a scared child and explains what happened on a haunted hayride. She also figured out how to become a kid whisperer, literally. Andrew has his dad's gamer podcasting set and joins from South Caroline with some disappointing news. On a positive note, he had a great trout salad. You Heard It Here First, Nikki needs that \"shred lett\" from Subway, ancient terms for our private parts, what men are insecure about most and we care about Howie Mandel fainting because somehow it turned to a conversation about ball play. They go around the horn discussing Top1 Bottom1 sodas and in the Final Thought, Luigi is getting a therapist today.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
