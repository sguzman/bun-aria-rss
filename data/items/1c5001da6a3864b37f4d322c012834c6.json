  "description": "Comedian, author and TV host W. Kamau Bell talks with Recode's Peter Kafka about the second season of his podcast, \"Politically Re-Active,\" and his CNN show, \"United Shades of America.\" Bell explains why his podcast persona is seemingly different from the Kamau that people see on TV, and how both of those things compare to being a stand-up comic. He also talks about the misconceptions that follow him as a comedian who is \"always talking about racism\" and why he doesn't mind too much if he bombs at a big, broad comedy club.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
