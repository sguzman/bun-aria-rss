  "description": "Harvard University is located in Cambridge, Massachusetts. This is America's oldest university and was established in 1636. This was meant for the education of clerics, but moved on to becoming an Ivy League College of higher learning. Presidents, esteemed authors and pioneers in medicine and engineering have all been educated here. This is a place of science. And yet, many students and staff have come away with tales of ghostly experiences. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of Harvard University! The Moment in Oddity features a refrigerator-sized asteroid being only the fifth one detected in history and This Month in History features an oxygen tank exploding on Apollo 13. <p>This episode sponsored by Best Fiends!
