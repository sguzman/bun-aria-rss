  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, President Biden and the democrats are promoting massive changes to the culture and our society with no scrutiny from the media. People claim to be tired of the news about the British monarchy, yet no one is discussing the American monarchy that's hard at work right in front of us. Biden has signed one executive order after the next. Then, Biden tries to include the vaccines as part of his American Rescue Plan when the whole world knows that it was President Trump's Operation Warp Speed that produced these vaccines. What's been developed under Biden is an immigration crisis and a national security crisis with China. Later, Donald Trump Jr joins the show and says that the teacher's unions are now what drives 'science.' He added that illegal immigrants have more rights in this country than citizens. Trump Jr. blasted Biden for signing more executive orders in his first year than Trump or any other President thus far. He also noted that he isn't ruling out a future run for office. Afterward, a seventh woman has now accused NY Governor Andrew Cuomo of aggressively groping her under her blouse after luring her to his office under the pretext of claiming he needed assistance with his mobile phone. Cuomo denies any wrongdoing. Finally, the President of Mexico has called Biden the \"migrant President\" blaming him for the increases at the border which provide opportunities for cartels and human traffickers. \n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
