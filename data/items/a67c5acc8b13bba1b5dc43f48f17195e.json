In a pig’s arse, friend.   \nDay comes to an end.\nThe gas fire breathes, the trees are darkly swayed.   \nAnd so Dear Warlock-Williams: I’m afraid—\n\nFunny how hard it is to be alone.\nI could spend half my evenings, if I wanted,   \nHolding a glass of washing sherry, canted   \nOver to catch the drivel of some bitch   \nWho’s read nothing but Which;\nJust think of all the spare time that has flown\n\nStraight into nothingness by being filled   \nWith forks and faces, rather than repaid   \nUnder a lamp, hearing the noise of wind,   \nAnd looking out to see the moon thinned   \nTo an air-sharpened blade.\nA life, and yet how sternly it’s instilled\n\nAll solitude is selfish. No one now\nBelieves the hermit with his gown and dish   \nTalking to God (who’s gone too); the big wish   \nIs to have people nice to you, which means   \nDoing it back somehow.\nVirtue is social. Are, then, these routines\n\nPlaying at goodness, like going to church?\nSomething that bores us, something we don’t do well   \n(Asking that ass about his fool research)   \nBut try to feel, because, however crudely,   \nIt shows us what should be?\nToo subtle, that. Too decent, too. Oh hell,\n\nOnly the young can be alone freely.\nThe time is shorter now for company,\nAnd sitting by a lamp more often brings\nNot peace, but other things.\nBeyond the light stand failure and remorse   \nWhispering Dear Warlock-Williams: Why, of course—\n\n\nPhilip Larkin, \"Vers de Société\" from Collected Poems.
