  "description": "<p>Recent efforts have been very successful in accurately mapping welfare in\ndatasparse regions of the world using satellite imagery and other\nnon-traditional data sources. However, the literature to date has focused on\npredicting a particular class of welfare measures, asset indices, which are\nrelatively insensitive to short term fluctuations in well-being. We suggest\nthat predicting more volatile welfare measures, such as consumption\nexpenditure, substantially benefits from the incorporation of data sources with\nhigh temporal resolution. By incorporating daily weather data into training and\nprediction, we improve consumption prediction accuracy significantly compared\nto models that only utilize satellite imagery.\n</p>",
