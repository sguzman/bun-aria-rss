  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, there's no proof of systemic racism, yet there is proof that the justice system reacted very quickly in response to George Floyd's murder. This tragedy has been hijacked from the mourning of a loss to a political attack on America's society, police, and President. Then, Lebron James says that our economic system, our cops, and our voting system are systemically racist. What we're witnessing is a communist-styled purging of police stations, professors, and administrators that dare to disagree. It's the end of free thought. Later, the Black Lives Matters movement has wrongly accused the Israeli Defense Forces of training American police to be systemically racist. This is becoming more and more like the French Revolution and the armed ANTIFA militants receive no criticism. Afterward, Rep. Mike Johnson joins the show to discuss a solutions-oriented plan for preserving American leadership around the globe and promoting a U.S. foreign policy that advances the interests of the American people at home and abroad.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
