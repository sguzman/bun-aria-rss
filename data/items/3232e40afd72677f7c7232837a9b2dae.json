  "description": "DAMN GRAVY U SO VICIOUSSSS\n\nYou know the rest. Today Sofia is joined by the one and only Yung Gravy! The rapper and MILF-matician himself graces the Sloot airwaves to discuss challenging topics, starting with the differentiation between the Gluck Gluck 3000 and 9000 (he came in with pressing questions for Sofia, obviously). Because of his love for MILF’s, Sofia surprises Gravy (and the Sloots) with a FaceTime from the woman of his dreams…Kendra Lust! Kendra is then put on the spot with the life or death decision of who she’d rather sleep with, Sofia or Gravy. Finally, Gravy lets us in on his love life, the dynamics of being a rappers “lady friend” and the latest on his recent TikTok beef and fling with Sherri Nicole, Addison Rae’s mom. This duo is EXACTLY what you would imagine Sloots, chaotic mixed with extreme sexual tension. Stay tuned for where Sofia’s *ride* on the Gravy Train takes her next.\n\n\nFollow Sofia on Instagram and Twitter @SofiaFranklyn\nFind merch HERE: https://sofiafranklyn.com/ \n\nVegamour: http://www.vegamour.com/SOFIA and use code SOFIA to save 20%\nAway: http://www.awaytravel.com/SOFIA to start your 100-day trial \nCerebral: http://www.cerebral.com/SOFIA for 65% off your first month\nUpside: Download the FREE Upside App and use promo code SOFIAF to get $5 or more cash back on your first purchase of 10$ or more\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
