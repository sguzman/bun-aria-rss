  "description": "<p>Hi, last week I fell down a flight of stairs. Then I went to the hospital. Then I emailed Dr. Mary Alexis Iaccarino, a Harvard Medical School professor and specialist in rehabilitation from traumatic brain injuries. I asked her all about what happens during a concussion, when to be worried, how long it takes to heal, when a person should get their ass to a hospital, what a brain scan can tell us about a head injury, what it CAN’T tell us about a head injury, if you can fall asleep after a head injury, and the differences between mTBI, TBI, SRC, CTE and even ATGATT. Plus, bike helmets, Natasha Richardson, fruit fly role models and some truly infuriating statistics on who gets mTBI treatment and who doesn’t. And stay tuned later this week for a bonus episode on what happens when bighorn sheep bash their skulls together. </p><p>Follow Dr. Mary Alexis Iaccarino on <a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/IaccarinoMD\">Twitter</a></p><p>A donation was made to <a href=\"https://homebase.org/\">HomeBase.org</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.alieward.com/ologies/neuropathology\">More episode info and links</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.alieward.com/ologies-sponsors\" target=\"_blank\">Sponsors of Ologies</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.alieward.com/ologies-extras\" target=\"_blank\">Transcripts & bleeped episodes</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/ologies\" target=\"_blank\">Become a patron of Ologies</a> for as little as a buck a month</p><p><a href=\"https://www.ologiesmerch.com\" target=\"_blank\">OlogiesMerch.com</a> has hats, shirts, totes, masks… </p><p>Follow @ologies on <a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/ologies\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ologies\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></p><p>Follow @alieward on <a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/AlieWard\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/AlieWard\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></p><p>Sound editing by Jarrett Sleeper of MindJam Media & Steven Ray Morris</p><p>Theme song by Nick Thorburn</p><p>Transcripts by Emily White of <a href=\"https://www.thewordary.com\" target=\"_blank\">The Wordary</a></p><p>Website by <a href=\"https://www.kellyrdwyer.com/photo\" target=\"_blank\">Kelly R.
