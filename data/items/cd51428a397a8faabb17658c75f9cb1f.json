  "description": "<p>On April 11, 1981, a 15-year-old girl named Barbara Cotton disappeared from Williston, North Dakota. Barbara's mother, Louise, called around to her friends to see if they had seen her, but no one said they had. Louise reported her daughter missing to the Williston Police Department and sent any tips she heard their way. The weeks and months passed with no sign of Barbara, and her case went ice cold. It didn't seem like much was being done to find Barb, at least to her loved ones; that is how it appeared. Perhaps she had run away? As with many missing teens in that era, that was often the assumption. Decades later, there is now a renewed effort to find Barbara Cotton and answer the many questions that linger today.</p><p>If you have any information regarding the disappearance of Barbara Cotton, please contact the Williston Police Department at 701-577-1212.</p><p>You can follow Barb’s story on social media at Find Barb Cotton.
