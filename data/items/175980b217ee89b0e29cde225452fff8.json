  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, the news media is ignorant and constitutionally illiterate. Executive privilege is a function of our separation of powers, part of our system of checks and balances. The president should and must use executive privilege to protect the office of the presidency. President Trump waived that privilege in the criminal investigation conducted with the executive branch but has no responsibility to do so with other branches of government. The White House Counsel, Don McGhann, sat for 30 hours of interviews with the Special Counsel, if Congress wants his testimony they should subpoena Robert Mueller's interview. The House Judiciary committee may ask, but has no inherent mandate to an audience with the White House attorney or any other member of the President's staff. Chairmen Jerry Nadler and Elijah Cummings are wrong. These subpoenas are political theater to continue sabotaging Trump's presidency. Then, freedom of the press originated as the printers right to use their printing press freely when publishing pamphlets during the revolution. Today this freedom is contorted to pump out propaganda. Later, a handful of leftwing politicians undermine our Constitutional structure for their own political benefit with this relentless pursuit for impeachment. Meanwhile the vast majority of them have profited from public service more than Enron and other Ponzi schemes; however, their weapon of choice is a TV camera and a subpoena.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
