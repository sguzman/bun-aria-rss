  "description": "On Mondy's Mark Levin Show, Democrats have spread their big lies and conspiracy theories since the attack on Paul Pelosi, which have turned out to be false. The same way they lie about Republicans cutting social security. It's false just like the stories about the mentally ill man, David DePape, being a MAGA Republican when he's spent most of his life as a leftwing activist. San Francisco District Attorney Brooke Jenkins held a press conference to detail the charges which include attempted murder, and kidnapping, and commented that she believes the attack was politically motivated, but interestingly gave no details on who the other targets on the attacker's hit list were. Will the media take any accountability for how they stoke the flames of divisive rhetoric and make it look like it’s the fault of the Republicans? Later, NY State Assemblyman Michael Lawler joins the show to discuss his campaign against the head of the Democrat's Congressional Campaign Committee (DCCC). Lawler says that the district doesn't even know his opponent. Lawler added that crime, inflation, and domestic energy production are the top issues facing the country and he supports making America safer and more energy independent both locally and nationally. Afterward, MI State Senator Tom Barrett calls in to discuss his race against Rep. Slotkin who was endorsed by Rep. Liz Cheney. Barrett says that the Democrats have already spent 30 million dollars against him in Michigan's 7th District. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
