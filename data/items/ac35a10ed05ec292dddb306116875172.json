  "description": "<p>Sisters provide each other with support in this episode of Las Culturistas that explores so much and yet so little. The ladies discuss watching themselves on camera after Matt's recent good news. Bowen questions whether or not it is ethical to wave your finger and scream \"yaz\" at a woman who is a billionaire from arms deals on <em>Bling Empire</em>. Matt, for some reason, watched <em>Love Life</em> and actually really enjoyed it! And... the culture of the moment <em>Promising Young Woman </em>gets discussed in such detail that we have to warn you repeatedly that there are <strong>SPOILERS</strong> (17:10 to 27:22 will discuss and spoil Promising Young Woman, so watch it first! Or skip that section!) Readers, the movie has us thinking! Also, Oscar and awards season at large, Gaga's anthem (with a special close-read of the performance by Hot Engineer Doug), Matt and Bowen reveal what they're listening to lately, opinionssssss on the Sex and the City reboot, Cookie Monster, Disneyland making changs to their fiully racist attractions and some good olf fashioned Wendy Williams appreciation.
