Fantasy Phillyboys goes off the rails (00:50:08-00:57:37). Dan Haren joins the show to talk playoff baseball, rocking the baby on the bases, toughest guys to pitch to and who he has winning it all (00:57:37-01:25:25). Sergio Perez and Max Verstappen join the show ahead of the Austin Grand Prix as Red Bull Racing is about to clinch the constructors cup (01:25:25-01:44:28). We finish with Fyre fest of the week and Hank trying to guess the lottery ball (01:44:28-01:57:27)</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
