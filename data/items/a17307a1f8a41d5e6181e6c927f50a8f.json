  "description": "<p><p>Kirk Minihane hops into the studio for a late night taping. Because it's the Kirk Minihane Show, we're recording while not one but two churches in our building have loud charismatic worship sessions. Minihane and Blind Mike react to Friday's raucous episode of Barstool Radio where Mike's job was on the line. Fortunately, Mike agreed to kiss Portnoy's feet in NYC, so we're all still Barstool employees. The fallout from Trenni Kusnierek smearing West Point cadets continues, even as the Boston media complex ignores it (0:51:00). Matt from Providence forces the issue onto WGBH, and Jim Braude ain't happy. Ricky Gervais does his best anti-PC routine at the Golden Globes, but is anyone watching? (1:18:00). A film critic for the Hollywood Reporter has identified insidious racism in... Toy Story 4 (1:26:00). WBZ's Jon Keller tells us what he's looking for in a big time newspaper columnist (1:59:00). </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
