  "description": "<p>Clay, Misty, Josh, Brent, Isaac, and Gary talk about Clay's pawn shop of an office and his stack of most influential books before&nbsp;diving into Charlie, Louie Dale and Russ Arthur, the agent who went undercover with Louie Dale. They spend more time with the tension of liking someone (except Brent) while rejecting some of their actions as well as parsing out the nuanced differences between Poachers and Outlaws.
