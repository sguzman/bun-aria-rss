She shares how she started in college and how different paths in life got her to be on the target of success where she is today. She says \" you build out that kind of target of where you want to be, and understand that getting to that point might mean doing things you don't enjoy for a number of years, but figuring that out is another way to get to that target without having like a clear bullseye\" She goes on to explain how this target map is helping her to create real change and ultimately makes an impact.
