  "description": "<p>Now I was scared for him. “Dobbs!” I yelled. “Dobbs!”</p> <p>My voice echoed through the woods. I scanned the area with my light but didn’t see anything else. Keep steady, I thought to myself. He could have just dropped it. Or maybe the other Ranger, what’s-his-name. They were likely at the tower together. Or maybe scouting the fire they had spotted. </p> <p>“Dobbs!” I screamed this time. The sky now was now a little illuminated by the tell-tale orange glow of fire. “Dobbs, can you hear me?”</p> <p>​Then I heard a man’s voice say, “Shut up!” </p> <p>His sudden voice surprised the tar out of me. If hadn’t been so exhausted I’d have jumped up a tree right then and there.</p> <p>“Where are you?” he was close but I couldn’t see him.</p> <p>“Shhh! Keep quiet! It’ll hear us!” he said to me.</p> <p>I located where the voice was coming from, about 10 feet away and a little behind me, then swung the light at him. I saw Dobbs under a thick patch of cedars up against a big rock, huddled on the ground.</p> <p> “Turn the light off and get over here,” he whispered.</p> <p>I was moving to where he was and clicked off my flashlight when it occurred to me what he’d said. ‘It’ would hear us.</p> <p>He had his big revolver in his hand so I raised my carbine and crouched beside him. That’s when I saw ‘it.’ </p> <p>We were right at the bottom edge of a roughly oval clearing, sloping steeply uphill toward more deep woods. The fire light from above and to our right was brighter, so I figured the fire must be just over the ridge, maybe a quarter mile ahead. </p> <p>At the far edge of the woods, maybe 30 yards away I saw a tall (can’t guess but easily over 6 to 7 feet tall) outline of an upright figure backlit by the glow from the fire. As if it knew where we were it was turned slightly towards us.</p> <p>I could not make out facial features but I could see it had large eyes that were reflecting the dim light. If I had thought of it I would have made a mental note of how tall it was in relation to the nearest tree, but all I was thinking was that this time, this was no bear.</p> <p> </p> <p>For information about the Live Show go to: https://sasquatchchronicles.com/live-podcast-show/</p> <p> </p>",
