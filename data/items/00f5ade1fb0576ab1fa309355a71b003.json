To provide a counterpoint to <a href= \"https://winefornormalpeople.libsyn.com/ep-350-alsaces-famed-domaine-paul-blanck-with-phillippe-blanck\"> Phillippe Blanck of Domaine Paul Blanck (Ep 250)</a>, the Schlumberger family is more devoutly French in attitude and Séverine tells us a different story of her family’s heritage, attitudes, and how <a href= \"https://www.domaines-schlumberger.com\">Domaine Schlumberger</a> developed and grew to become one of the largest family-owned domaines in Alsace.</p> <p><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/vokGKIDn_400x400.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"201\" height=\"201\" /></p> <p>Founded by Nicolas Schlumberger in 1810, <a href= \"https://www.domaines-schlumberger.com\">Domaine Schlumberger</a> produces all estate-bottled wines from southern Alsace. The Schlumberger vineyards are among the largest in Alsace, and one of the largest blocks of contiguous vineyards in all of France. The Schlumberger domains operate and vinify 140 ha/346 acres of vines, half of which are spread over 4 Grands Crus, which have been in the family since 1810 -- Kitterlé, Kessler, Saering and Spiegel. The vineyard is sustainably managed, 30 ha is biodynamically farmed, and the <a href=\"https://www.domaines-schlumberger.com\">Domaine</a> is working on organic certification for the whole property.</p> <p> </p> <p>Séverine Schlumberger, co-owner of the <a href= \"https://www.domaines-schlumberger.com\">Domaine</a>, is part of the 7th generation running the estate. Here are the show notes:</p> <p> </p> <p>First we tackle history, as it is so essential in Alsace…</p> <ul> <li>Séverine tells us about her family history in Alsace. She discusses how her family came from Germany to Guebwiller and how their family grew in size and diversified from wine to textiles, finance and oil in a network that stretched from Alsace, to Paris, to the United States. Séverine paints a picture of a family who very much considered themselves French and defied German occupation each time it occurred in the 19th and 20th</li> </ul> <p><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/dscn1963-1920x1440.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"191\" height=\"143\" /></p> <ul> <li>I ask Séverine if she finds that her family was particularly egalitarian because the prestige cuvées are named after the women: Christine, Anne, and Clarisse. In her very matter-of-fact, brass tacks style, Séverine tells us that her family was actually quite sexist, and that the women either needed to die or become very old to even be considered important in the domaine! I love the honesty!</li> </ul> <p><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/9cba5ad4e839382ac60191a1d87b53a9.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"159\" height=\"185\" /></p> <p> </p> <ul> <li>We speak briefly about Michel Schlumberger in Sonoma, which a distant relative of Séverine’s established and then sold. In case you were wondering, there is no close tie between the wineries and wasn’t even before the sale to a holding company.</li> </ul> <p><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/img_4351-1920x1280.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"200\" /></p> <p> </p> <p>Next we address the estate:</p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://www.domaines-schlumberger.com\">The Domaine</a> is located on steep, dry, infertile hills with slopes of up to 50% gradient and at an altitude ranging from 820- 1280 ft/250 - 390 meters.
