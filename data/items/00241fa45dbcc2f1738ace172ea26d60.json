  "description": "<p>Meet<strong>&nbsp;Adam Grant</strong>,&nbsp;an organizational psychologist who specializes in how we can find motivation and meaning in work, and live more generous and creative lives.</p><p>After graduating from Harvard magna cum laude, Adam&nbsp;completed his master’s degree and Ph.D. at the University of Michigan&nbsp;<em>in just three years.</em>&nbsp;At 28 he became Wharton’s youngest-ever tenured professor, where he has been recognized as the top-rated professor for&nbsp;seven straight years, named&nbsp;one of the world’s&nbsp;10 most influential management thinkers&nbsp;and listed among&nbsp;Fortune‘s 40 under 40.</p><p>One of the world’s most-cited, prolific and significant researchers in business and economics, Adam is the author of several&nbsp;<em>New York Times</em>&nbsp;bestselling books that have sold millions of copies and been translated into 35 languages, including&nbsp;Give and Take,&nbsp;Originals,&nbsp;and&nbsp;Option B.&nbsp;His books have been named among the year’s best by Amazon, Apple, the&nbsp;<em>Financial Times,</em>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<em>The Wall Street Journal</em>&nbsp;and praised by J.J. Abrams, Richard Branson, Bill and Melinda Gates, Malcolm Gladwell, Daniel Kahneman, and Malala Yousafzai.&nbsp;</p><p>Certain to be another culture-tilting bestseller, Adam’s new book, and the focus of today’s conversation, is&nbsp;&nbsp;Think Again: The Power of Knowing What You Don’t Know.</p><p>In addition, Adam’s&nbsp;TED Talks&nbsp;on original thinkers and givers and takers have garnered over 20 million views. And when he’s not writing, teaching, parenting, or consulting on behalf of organizations like Google, the NBA, or the Gates Foundation, he hosts&nbsp;WorkLife, a chart-topping TED original podcast.</p><p>Equal parts fun and powerful, this conversation is about the importance and power of interpersonal and collective rethinking.&nbsp;</p><p>We discuss strategies for engaging with others who see the world differently. And what we can learn when we lead not with argumentation but rather with curiosity and humility.</p><p>In a time of entrenched polarization, Adam creates space for nuance. He teaches us to think critically and carefully. To ask questions. And to hold our views flexibly.&nbsp;</p><p>He also offers sage advice on work in the time of COVID, when so many people’s professional ecosystems have been turned upside down.&nbsp;</p><p>My hope is that this exchange encourages you to identify your own biases. Emboldens you to connect more meaningfully with those who see things differently.
