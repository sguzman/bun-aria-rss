  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, the main issue of the Roger Stone trial is the matter of the jury foreperson, Tamika Hart, concealed her partiality and celebrated the guilty verdict on social media. Hart, the jury foreperson on the Stone case has been proven to be a partisan attorney that worked in the Obama Administration and made disparaging comments of Stone and President Trump. These actions are wildly inappropriate, she should have recused herself from serving on that jury, and as an attorney, she knows it — this was not a fair trial. Then, Trump sees the injustice on Stone and makes a comment; Attorney General Barr has already acted on these injustices and would prefer to do so without commentary from the White House, this is understandable from both perspectives. Later, World War II didn't happen because we were globalists, it happened because we weren't prepared. Today's actions by Congress to limit the President's war powers will make our country less prepared and will hurt the office of the presidency. Simply put, Congress controls the funding and the President is the Commander in Chief.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
