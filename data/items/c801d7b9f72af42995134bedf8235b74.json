  "description": "<p>This is the story of an&nbsp;athletic prodigy. It’s also the story of heartbreak. And a hero&nbsp;that became a&nbsp;friend.</p><p>Meet&nbsp;<strong>John Moffet</strong>.</p><p>His journey begins at 11. To keep him out of trouble, John’s&nbsp;parents enroll him in swim lessons. Mere weeks later, it was clear he was&nbsp;special.</p><p>Within a year, John was obliterating national age group records.&nbsp;By 16 he made his first Olympic Team, becoming the youngest male&nbsp;athlete on the&nbsp;entire U.S.A. squad. But America would boycott the&nbsp;1980 Moscow Games, robbing&nbsp;John and so many athletes of the&nbsp;opportunity to share their gifts on the&nbsp;world’s largest stage.</p><p>Four years later, John ascended the starting blocks at 1984 Los&nbsp;Angeles Olympic Games as the world record holder and gold medal&nbsp;favorite in his&nbsp;specialty — the 100m breastroke. But a severe&nbsp;groin injury suffered in a&nbsp;preliminary heat would once again crush his dreams&nbsp;of Olympic glory.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s a story well told in Bud Greenspan’s Olympic documentary&nbsp;16 Days of Glory&nbsp;— a legendary filmmaker who would later become John’s&nbsp;mentor&nbsp;in his subsequent career as a storyteller. It’s a career&nbsp;that began humbly in&nbsp;the pioneering days of reality television and would&nbsp;ultimately lead to John&nbsp;taking home three 3 Emmys as an executive producer of&nbsp;The Amazing Race.</p><p>John’s latest creative pursuit is&nbsp;Sports, Life, Balance&nbsp;—&nbsp;&nbsp;a new podcast about the many timeless lessons learned through&nbsp;sport and their&nbsp;transformative application to all areas of life. Launching&nbsp;around Thanksgiving, be sure to check it out and subscribe — this one’s worth&nbsp;it.</p><p>As a daydreaming adolescent swimmer, god-like photos of John ripped from the pages of&nbsp;Swimming World&nbsp;magazine adorned my bedroom wall. So it was utterly surreal when my path delivered me&nbsp;to Stanford. The opportunity for this bright-eyed, 17-year old freshman to call John my teammate was a dream come true.</p><p>And such began a friendship we have maintained for the last thirty-five years.</p><p>This is a conversation about what happens when desire meets deeds. It’s about determination and perseverance. The power of storytelling. The&nbsp;importance of reinvention. And the courage to blaze&nbsp;your own unique path.</p><p>It’s also a rundown of Olympic trials and tribulations — and the conglomerate of raw and historic athleticism that was the hallmark of Stanford in the&nbsp;mid-1980s.</p><p>Packed with life lessons acquired by dint of John’s extraordinary athletic and professional career, it’s a master class on how to keep pushing when it&nbsp;matters most.
