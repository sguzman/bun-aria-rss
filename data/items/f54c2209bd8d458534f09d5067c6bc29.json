  "description": "Political scientists have argued that Donald Trump exacerbated long-simmering changes in polarization, populism, and other aspects of politics. In their book News After Trump: Journalism's Crisis of Relevance in a Changed Media Culture (Oxford University Press, 2021), Matt Carlson, Seth C. Lewis, and Sue Robinson, argue that Trump's candidacy and presidency did the same in journalism. The question now is, how do news organizations move forward and continue to deliver informational value to the public at a time when they're just one of many information sources people see?\nTaking an expansive view of the contemporary media and political environment during the Trump years, News After Trump portrays a media culture in transition. As journalism's very relevance comes to be increasingly questioned, the authors focus on how different actors — from Trump to small-town newspaper editors — use their cultural power to define journalism, assess its value, and question what the news should look like. This conversation is especially important as news organizations continue to grapple with their role in standing up for democratic norms and values.\nMatt Carlson is associate professor at the Hubbard School of Journalism and Mass Communication at the University of Minnesota. \nSeth C. Lewis is founding holder of the Shirley Papé Chair in Emerging Media in the School of Journalism and Communication at the University of Oregon.\nJenna Spinelle is a journalism instructor at Penn State's Donald P. Bellisario College of Communications. She's also the communications specialist for the university's McCourtney Institute for Democracy, where she hosts and produces the Democracy Works podcast.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
