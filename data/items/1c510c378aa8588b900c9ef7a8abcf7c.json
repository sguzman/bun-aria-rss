  "title": "Ep. 575 - Biden Is The One Who Needs To Condemn Violent Extremists",
  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the media is breathlessly reporting that Trump refused to condemn white supremacists in last night’s debate. It’s a lie. He did condemn them. He’s already condemned them. He’s condemned them many times. Meanwhile, Joe Biden and the rest of the Democrats have actually never condemned the violent extremists in the midst, like BLM and Antifa. That’s the real outrage, considering those groups are currently burning down our cities. Also Five Headlines including an unintentionally hilarious “fact check” on a Babylon Bee article. And in our Daily Cancellation, we’ll cancel the Atlantic for trying to make a scandal out of the fact that Trump allegedly makes fun of televangelists.
