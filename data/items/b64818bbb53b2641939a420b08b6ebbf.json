  "description": "Joe Biden is off to Europe. He will meet with Allies and with Vladimir Putin. Under Trump, that was a formula for headlines and disaster. Under all presidents such trips produce fraught analyses seeking to identify presidential doctrines and historic deliverables. But most of diplomacy is blocking and tackling. And much of it best done out of sight of the public. We discuss the upcoming trip with Atlantic columnist Tom Nichols, AEI's Kori Schake and Georgetown Law's Rosa Brooks and we come to the conclusion that \"Biden Returns Home After Uneventful Trip\" might be the best outcome of all. We also discuss what might be the tougher upcoming diplomatic trip in the next few days, that of Kamala Harris to Mexico and Central America. Don't miss it. \nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
