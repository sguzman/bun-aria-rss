  "description": "<p>I don't know anyone who openly admits to loving the Kardashians. If everyone hates them, who in the hell is watching all their shows? In this episode we discuss fame and celebrity. Who deserves to be celebrated? Why do we hate certain celebrities? Is it possible that famous people serve a function in society other than just annoying the hell out of us? Why can't I stop watching (and being on) reality shows? My buddy Nick Youssef and I get into all of it. </p>\n",
