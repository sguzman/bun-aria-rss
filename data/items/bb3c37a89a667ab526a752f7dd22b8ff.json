  "description": "Evidence is mounting that Putin’s invasion of Ukraine is not going as smoothly as he’d planned, with Russian troops undersupplied and looting groceries for food. In Ukraine, the postal service is honoring the brave soldiers of Snake Island with a stamp commemorating their infamous retort to a Russian warship. Meanwhile, there’s a cursed painting available for only $50 on eBay, and a man in Florida did one of the most Florida things imaginable: called the police because his meth wasn’t working. Academy Award winner Sandra Bullock returns to The Late Show with stories from the set of her new film, “The Lost City,” in which she spends a significant amount of time acting in front of a naked Channing Tatum. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
