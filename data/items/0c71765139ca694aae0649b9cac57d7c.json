  "description": "<p>In the first part of the show, the guys quickly review some common metaphors used in our everyday language. “Time is money,” “life is a journey,” etc. Tim quotes again from George Lakoff saying that in every metaphor, there are elements contained within a metaphor. For example, in the “life is a journey” metaphor, there is embedded vocabulary like viewing people as “companions” and viewing obstacles as “bumps in the road.”</p>\n<p>Tim posits four main metaphors in the Bible:<br />\nGod is a dryland/mountain/rock.<br />\nWaters are danger/evil/chaos.<br />\nHumans are either at peace or at war with animals.<br />\nThe Garden of Eden river and the Tree of Life.</p>\n<p>In part two, the guys begin to break down the first metaphor listed above. Why is God thought of as “dryland?” To find out, Tim and Jon dive into Genesis 1 and 2, outlining creation.</p>\n<p>Tim says the imagery found later in the Old Testament is rooted in imagery in Genesis 1 and 2. For example, in Genesis 15, “you plant them in the mountain of your inheritance” shows that the Hebrews viewed their cosmic mountain Garden of Eden as paradise, and the Jewish temple is considered the symbol of paradise, which is man in communion with God.</p>\n<p>Jon makes a comment about a Fuller Projection map.
