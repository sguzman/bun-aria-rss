  "description": "<p>If you’ve spent any time in South Florida, you’re likely already familiar with <strong>Marc Thee</strong>’s work. Over the past 35 years the co-founder of Marc-Michaels has become one of the region’s most celebrated interior designers, and in an industry where most firms stop growing at a staff of ten, he oversees seventy, taking on projects all over the world. On this episode of the Business of Home podcast, Thee speaks with host Dennis Scully about why he tells his staff not to think like designers, how mentorship means letting go, and why the client’s perception is the only thing that matters. A special thank you to Dedon for hosting the conversation in front of a live audience at the Design Center of the Americas. This episode is sponsored by High Point Market and Buildlane.</p>\n",
