He is currently 19 years old and he is a single child. Though, he considers his closest female cousin as his sister since they grew up very closely together. His immediate family consists of himself, his mother, aunt, sister, grandmother and grandpa. Most of his family lives in <a title=\"City of Brampton\" href=\"http://www.brampton.ca/en/pages/welcome.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">Brampton</a>; however he has had to move to <a title=\"City of Toronto\" href=\"http://www.toronto.ca\" target=\"_blank\">Toronto</a> in order to go into grade nine at <a title=\"Jarvis Collegiate Institute\" href=\"http://schools.tdsb.on.ca/jarvisci/\" target=\"_blank\">Jarvis Collegiate Institute</a>.</p>\n<p>When he was 12 years old his mother signed him up in the <a title=\"Army Cadets\" href=\"http://www.cadets.ca/en\" target=\"_blank\">Army Cadet</a> program because she thought he could use more discipline. Throughout his cadet career, he transferred from two different cadet units before his found his home at the <a title=\"48th Highlanders of Canada\" href=\"http://www.48highlanders.com/\" target=\"_blank\">48<sup>th</sup> Highlanders of Canada</a>. There he achieved the Cadet rank of Master Warrant Officer and held the position of Drill Sergeant Major and the highest award in the Canadian Cadet program: the <a title=\"Lord Strathcona Medal\" href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Lord_Strathcona_Medal\" target=\"_blank\">Lord Strathcona Medal</a>. Before aging out of the Cadet program, he received the <a title=\"Royal Canadian Legion\" href=\"http://www.legion.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Royal Canadian Legion</a> <a title=\"Cadet Medal of Excellence\" href=\"http://www.on.legion.ca/youth/lcme.asp\" target=\"_blank\">Cadet Medal of Excellence</a> and a scholarship from law firm for college.</p>\n<p>In September of 2014, he’ll be starting his second year of the Police Foundations Program at <a title=\"Humber College\" href=\"http://www.humber.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Humber College</a>. In April 2015, he’ll be graduating with his diploma and has the intention to transfer his credits to <a title=\"Ryerson University\" href=\"http://www.ryerson.ca/index.html\" target=\"_blank\">Ryerson University</a> for Criminology. The lawyer who presented him the scholarship saw his interests in becoming a police officer with the <a title=\"Toronto Police Service\" href=\"http://www.torontopolice.on.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Toronto Police Service</a> and a soldier with the <a title=\"Canadian Army\" href=\"http://www.army-armee.forces.gc.ca/en/index.page\" target=\"_blank\">Canadian Army</a>. He has helped Pte Rigg enlist as a Private in the 48<sup>th</sup> Highlanders of Canada. Today, he is one of his mentors and is a Major with the <a title=\"Queen's Own Rifles of Canada\" href=\"http://www.qor.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Queen&#8217;s Own Rifles of Canada</a>.</p>\n<p>Pte Rigg was sworn into the Canadian Army in October 2013 and started his Basic Military Qualification course a week later. The course was 13 weekends long and was very memorable. He learned a lot of new things, gained new skills and made new friends. He also earned the distinction of being named the course top candidate. That is his biggest accomplishment to date, but after completing his infantry trade courses by the end of the summer of 2014, he expects that that would likely be his biggest accomplishment.</p>\n<p>Before entering the Canadian Army he took a year off after graduating high school in the summer of 2012. Before entering college, he worked security at different sites around downtown Toronto. He has worked at <a title=\"Scotiabank Plaza\" href=\"http://www.scotiaplaza.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Scotiabank Plaza</a>, <a title=\"Bell Media\" href=\"http://www.bellmedia.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Bell Media</a>/<a title=\"CP24\" href=\"http://www.cp24.com/\" target=\"_blank\">CP24</a> Building and a mall across <a title=\"Dundas Square\" href=\"http://www.ydsquare.ca/\" target=\"_blank\">Dundas Square</a>. Pte Rigg has also had the opportunity to work with the <a title=\"Toronto Police Service as Youth in Policing Initiative\" href=\"http://www.torontopolice.on.ca/yipi/\" target=\"_blank\">Toronto Police Service as Youth in Policing Initiative</a> summer student and spoke at their media launch in front of <a title=\"Police Chief William Blair\" href=\"http://www.torontopolice.on.ca/bios/blair.php\" target=\"_blank\">Police Chief Bill Blair</a>.</p>\n<p>Pte Rigg continues to progress towards his goal to become a police constable with the Toronto Police Service and progressing through the ranks as a Canadian Soldier. He says “Without the help of many people in what I’ve done so far, I wouldn’t be anywhere as close to my dreams as I have expected.”</p>\n<p>During the intro to this episode, I mentioned the Bunker Military Museum in Cobalt, Ontario.  Please check them out if ever you find yourself between North Bay and New Liskeard.  The museum can also be found at <a title=\"The Bunker Military Museum\" href=\"www.bunkermilitarymuseum.ca\" target=\"_blank\">this link</a>.</p>\n<p>Follow me on Twitter @MikeLacroix32</p>\n<p>You can support this site by shopping on <a title=\"Amazon.ca\" href=\"http://www.amazon.ca?_encoding=UTF8&tag=thecanamilihi-20\" target=\"_blank\">Amazon</a>.  You still enjoy Amazon&#8217;s great prices, but a portion of your purchase goes to supporting the show.</p>\n<audio class=\"wp-audio-shortcode\" id=\"audio-716-28\" preload=\"none\" style=\"width: 100%;\" controls=\"controls\"><source type=\"audio/mpeg\" src=\"http://podcast.canadianmilitaryhistorypodcast.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/CMHP-Episode-031-Pte-Joshua-Rigg.mp3?_=28\" /><a href=\"http://podcast.canadianmilitaryhistorypodcast.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/CMHP-Episode-031-Pte-Joshua-Rigg.mp3\">http://podcast.canadianmilitaryhistorypodcast.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/CMHP-Episode-031-Pte-Joshua-Rigg.mp3</a></audio>\n<p><a href=\"http://podcast.canadianmilitaryhistorypodcast.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/24.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-718\" src=\"http://podcast.canadianmilitaryhistorypodcast.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/24-300x224.jpg\" alt=\"24\" width=\"300\" height=\"224\" srcset=\"http://podcast.canadianmilitaryhistorypodcast.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/24-300x224.jpg 300w, http://podcast.canadianmilitaryhistorypodcast.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/24-1024x764.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Pte Rigg participated in the Toronto Police Service Youth in Policing Initiative</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://podcast.canadianmilitaryhistorypodcast.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/25.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-719\" src=\"http://podcast.canadianmilitaryhistorypodcast.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/25-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"25\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"http://podcast.canadianmilitaryhistorypodcast.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/25-300x225.jpg 300w, http://podcast.canadianmilitaryhistorypodcast.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/25.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Cadet MWO Rigg visits Toronto Police HQ</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://podcast.canadianmilitaryhistorypodcast.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/26.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-720\" src=\"http://podcast.canadianmilitaryhistorypodcast.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/26-300x240.jpg\" alt=\"26\" width=\"300\" height=\"240\" srcset=\"http://podcast.canadianmilitaryhistorypodcast.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/26-300x240.jpg 300w, http://podcast.canadianmilitaryhistorypodcast.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/26.jpg 800w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Cadet MWO Rigg is awarded the Royal Canadian Legion Cadet Medal of Excellence by MWO Pat Love of the 4th Canadian Division HQ.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://podcast.canadianmilitaryhistorypodcast.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/109.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-722\" src=\"http://podcast.canadianmilitaryhistorypodcast.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/109-300x225.jpg\" alt=\"109\" width=\"300\" height=\"225\" srcset=\"http://podcast.canadianmilitaryhistorypodcast.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/109-300x225.jpg 300w, http://podcast.canadianmilitaryhistorypodcast.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/109-1024x768.jpg 1024w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 300px) 100vw, 300px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Pte Rigg on his Basic Military Qualification course at Fort York Armoury.</p>\n<p><a href=\"http://podcast.canadianmilitaryhistorypodcast.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/003.jpg\"><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"alignnone size-medium wp-image-717\" src=\"http://podcast.canadianmilitaryhistorypodcast.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/003-225x300.jpg\" alt=\"003\" width=\"225\" height=\"300\" srcset=\"http://podcast.canadianmilitaryhistorypodcast.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/003-225x300.jpg 225w, http://podcast.canadianmilitaryhistorypodcast.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/003-768x1024.jpg 768w, http://podcast.canadianmilitaryhistorypodcast.ca/wp-content/uploads/2014/09/003.jpg 960w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 225px) 100vw, 225px\" /></a></p>\n<p>Pte Rigg poses for a &#8216;selfie&#8217;
