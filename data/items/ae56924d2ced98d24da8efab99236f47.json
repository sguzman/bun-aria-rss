  "description": "Our college campuses have become breeding grounds for woke cults, former Portland State University professor Peter Boghossian argues, and the rest of society has suffered because of it. But what can we do about it? Peter, who escaped the cult of academia, joins Glenn to discuss his latest solution: He's helping to start the University of Austin, where students will be taught HOW to think, not WHAT to think. But the dangerous ideologies that started in our schools have now spread nationwide as people abandon reality for \"anti-civics,\" and global elites work to transform our lives without inviting us to the table. Glenn and Peter discuss what we must start valuing again to turn things around.\n\nSponsors:\n\nIf you want 100% quality American meat at a great price, Good Ranchers has got you covered!
