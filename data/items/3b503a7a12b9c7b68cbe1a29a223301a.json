  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, millions of Americans fought for this country and didn't do it so that some ivy-league educated liberal could piss it away. Every American must do their part to save this nation, or we will lose it. The greatest threat we face is American Marxism, which has lamentably found a home in the Democrat Party. Then, abortion is much more aggressive than the Democrats who wrote Roe v Wade ever envisioned. Roe describes viability and breaks up the pregnancy into trimesters based on 'the science.' The new anti-science abortion-on-demand movement ignores the very science that Roe was based on. Later, Sen. Raphael Warnock's Ebenezer Baptist Church is a slumlord. Residents complain that elevators are not working for handicapped residents and the Church recently received federal grants from the American Rescue Plan to make repairs. Warnock voted on this bill that he directly benefitted from. Afterward, Rep. Lee Zeldin joins the show with an update on his race for Governor of New York. Zeldin reminds us that Gov. Kathy Hochul is soft on crime and all New Yorkers, irrespective of political party affiliation, are tired of it.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
