  "content": "Let \\(\\left(1+\\sqrt{2}\\right)^{2012}=a+b\\sqrt{2}\\), where \\(a\\) and \\(b\\) are integers. What is the greatest common divisor of \\(b\\) and \\(81\\)?<br />Source: 2011-2012 SDML High School 2a, problem 15.<br /><br />Let \\((1+\\sqrt{2})^n = a_n + b_n \\sqrt{2}\\). I've thought about this some more, and there's a nice way to describe the highest power of \\(3\\) that divides \\(b_n\\). This is probably outside of the scope of the intended solution, however.<br /><br />First note that \\((1-\\sqrt{2})^n = a_n - b_n \\sqrt{2}\\), and so from \\((1+\\sqrt{2})(1-\\sqrt{2})=-1\\) we get \\((1+\\sqrt{2})^n (1-\\sqrt{2})^n = {(-1)}^n\\). This gives \\[{a_n}^2 - 2 {b_n}^2 = {(-1)}^n.\\] Now define the highest power of a prime \\(p\\) that divides \\(n\\) to be \\(\\operatorname{\\nu}_p(n)\\).<br />From cubing and using the above result it's straightforward to prove that if \\(\\operatorname{\\nu}_3(b_n) = k > 0\\) then \\(\\operatorname{\\nu}_3(b_{3n}) = k+1\\).<br />Note \\((1+\\sqrt{2})^4 = 17 + 12\\sqrt{2} \\equiv -1+3\\sqrt{2} \\pmod{3^2}\\). Cubing and using the first formula as before, we can in fact show that \\[(1+\\sqrt{2})^{4\\cdot 3^n} \\equiv -1 + 3^{n+1}\\sqrt{2} \\pmod{3^{n+2}},\\] and squaring we also have \\[(1+\\sqrt{2})^{8\\cdot 3^n} \\equiv 1 + 3^{n+1}\\sqrt{2} \\pmod{3^{n+2}}.\\] Now assume \\(\\operatorname{\\nu}_3(b_m) = k, \\operatorname{\\nu}_3(b_n) = l\\) and \\(k\\neq l\\). From the top formula if \\(3 | b_i\\) then \\(3 \\not{|} a_i\\), and it follows that \\[\\operatorname{\\nu}_3(b_{m+n}) = \\min(k,l).\\]Putting this all together, write \\(n = 4\\cdot m +k\\), where \\(0\\leq k <4\\). If \\(k\\neq 0\\), then \\(\\operatorname{\\nu}_3(b_{n}) = 0\\). If \\(k=0\\), let the base-3 expansion of \\(m\\) be \\(a_i \\cdot 3^i + \\ldots + a_0\\). Then \\[\\operatorname{\\nu}_3(b_{n}) = \\min_{a_j \\neq 0} j+1 .\\]<br />For \\(n=2012\\), we have \\(2012 = 4\\cdot 503 = 4\\cdot(2\\cdot 3^5 + 3^2 + 2\\cdot 3 + 2)\\) and so \\(\\operatorname{\\nu}_3(b_{2012})=1\\). We don't actually need to compute the entire base-3 expansion for 503, of course; we only need to observe that it's not divisible by 3.<br /><br />For \\(n=2016\\), we have \\(2016 = 4\\cdot 504 = 4\\cdot(2\\cdot 3^5 + 2\\cdot 3^2)\\) and so \\(\\operatorname{\\nu}_3(b_{2016})=3\\).<br />",
