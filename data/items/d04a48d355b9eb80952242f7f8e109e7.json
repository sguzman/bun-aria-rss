  "description": "Adam and Dr. Drew open the show talking about the recent news story concerning a Canadian shop teacher who has been gaining notoriety as a result of some parents having concerns about her over exaggerated appearance. They go on to have a discussion about fetishes and how it's possible that the fetish of reaction is a new component that isn't being explored. Adam also explains why the school defending the actions of that teacher is a dangerous road to venture down. Drew then turns the conversation to the recent trend of (largely) red states transporting migrants to blue cities and they juxtapose the answer that Jen Psaki gave a year ago to what is going on today. \n\nPlease Support Our Sponsors:\nCon-Cret.com/Podcast\nThe Jordan Harbinger Show\nDownload InvestAll and use promo code Adam",
