  "description": "On Thursday’s Mark Levin show, if the president had complied with every demand and subpoena for witnesses, classified information, and grand jury information, as the Democrat managers have insisted for days he was required to do, the president would’ve destroyed the office of the presidency, crippled the executive branch, effectively eviscerated separation of powers, and helped establish an extraordinarily powerful and tyrannical House. It’s the president who’s defending and protecting the Constitution, for which the radical and rogue House Democrats have impeached him and demand his removal. The Democrats’ purpose here is to prevent the President from even running for re-election. We must treat this campaign and this election like we are way behind, because everything is at stake. Also, John Roberts was out of line when he refused to read Sen Rand Paul’s question at the impeachment trial about Eric Ciaramella. Roberts is in effect doing the work of the democrats. There was nothing wrong with Rand’s question. Finally, Rabbi Shmuley calls in to discuss Trump’s middle east peace plan.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
