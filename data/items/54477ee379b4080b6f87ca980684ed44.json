  "description": "On Wednesday’s Mark Levin Show, President Trump is both the president as well as a citizen, but the media and democrats want to make the case that Trump isn’t free to control the executive branch. They’re calling Trump’s tweet saying Jeff Sessions should stop the rigged witch hunt an obstruction of justice – do they even know what obstruction is? Over 60 million people voted for Donald Trump, and now a small group of establishment elites are trying to undo the entire election. Also, Robert Mueller and his attorneys are trying to create the narrative against Paul Manafort, but the judge in the case isn’t having it. The prosecution kept using the word “oligarch” when describing Manafort and tried to use his expensive suits as proof he was evading his taxes – and the judge threw it out. The early skepticism could spell trouble for Mueller. Later, Iran is threatening to shut down the Strait of Hormuz, a move that would have major impact on international shipping. When the U.S. slashes military spending and lets its guard down, we tend to have wars. The media continues to ignore real issues like Iranian aggression while obsessing over Trump tweets in an effort to push their ideological agenda. Finally, Mark speaks with David Harsanyi of The Federalist about the panic over 3-D printed guns.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
