  "description": "<p>Real-time systems are a set of programs, a scheduling policy and a system\narchitecture, constrained by timing requirements. Most of daily embedded\ndevices are real-time systems, e.g. airplanes, cars, trains, spatial probes,\netc. The time required by a program for its end-to-end execution is called its\nresponse time. Usually, upper-bounds of response times are computed in order to\nprovide safe deadline miss probabilities. In this paper, we propose a suited\nre-parametrization of the inverse Gaussian mixture distribution adapted to\nresponse times of real-time systems and the estimation of deadline miss\nprobabilities. The parameters and their associated deadline miss probabilities\nare estimated with an adapted Expectation-Maximization algorithm.\n</p>",
