  "description": "<p>Happy New Year! 2020 is almost here and we do a little a summary of what went on with Timesuck in 2019. It was the best of years. Hail Nimrod! Also, for a little inspiration, we cover the life and heroic times of Colonel Robert L. Howard - one of the most highly decorated US Special Forces officers in United States military history. His bravery in battle in Vietnam reads like the script for an over-the-top Rambo-type Hollywood film. His courage under fire is so inspiring. Let his life fire you up to take on the new decade!
