  "title": "Ep. 909 - The Never Ending Cycle Of Mass Hysteria",
  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, mass hysteria has gripped our nation. People are so hysterical that many are now begging for nuclear war. But closer to home, on a smaller scale, we see the hysteria in the proliferation of racism hoaxes, especially in our schools. Speaking of which, there have been three in our schools in just the past week or two. We’ll talk about it. Also, Ukrainian President Zelensky addresses congress and asks for a No Fly Zone, which would lead directly to World War 3. And a funny thing: when most Americans are told what’s actually in the so-called “don’t say gay bill,” they support it. Plus,  lawmakers want to hold social media companies responsible for making our children addicted to the internet. And, in our daily cancellation, lawmakers also now plan to make Daylight Savings permanent. I’ll explain why that’s a bad idea, and might in fact bring about the end of human civilization. All of that and more today on the Matt Walsh Show. \nI am now a self-acclaimed beloved children’s author.
