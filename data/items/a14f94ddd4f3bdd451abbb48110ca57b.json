  "description": "Last week we learned about using the four different styles of humor to your advantage, and who makes a good target for a joke. But what if you read the room wrong and absolutely bomb? On this episode of How To!, the second in a two-part series, we resume our conversation with Naomi Bagdonas, co-author of Humor, Seriously!, and Michael Terry, the most hilarious hedge fund guy we’ve ever met. They swap stories about office jokes that fell flat, how to navigate a suddenly tense situation and what to do if your humor accidentally offends someone (especially your boss). \nIf you liked this episode, check out “How To Be Funny” with comedian Gary Gulman. \nIf you want to discover your own humor style, take the test on Naomi and Jennifer’s website. \nDo you have a joke that killed at the office, or totally bombed?
