  "description": "<p>The expansion law proposed by Padmanabhan suggests that the evolution of the\nvolume of the horizon is due to the difference between the degrees of freedom\non the horizon and the degrees of freedom in the bulk enclosed by the horizon.\nIn formulating this law, Padmanabhan used the temperature, $T=H/2\\pi$, for a\ndynamical expansion. In this work, we modified the expansion law using\nKodama-Hayward temperature, the dynamical temperature, for the horizon, first\nin (3+1) Einstein's gravity and extended it to higher order gravity theories\nsuch as (n+1) Einstein gravity, Gauss-Bonnet gravity, and more general Lovelock\ngravity. Contrary to the conventional approach, we expressed degrees of freedom\nof the horizon in terms of the surface energy of the horizon. Also, we have\nexpressed modified expansion law in terms of cosmic components. It then turns\nout that it is possible to express the modified expansion law in a form as if\n$T=H/2\\pi$ is the temperature of the dynamical horizon.\n</p>",
