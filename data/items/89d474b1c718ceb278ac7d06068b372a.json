  "description": "The history of humanity is intertwined with that of the horse to such a degree that it is no exaggeration to say that the existence of either species as we know it today is a product of its relationship with the other. In The Age of the Horse: An Equine Journey Through Human History (Atlantic Monthly Press, 2017), Susanna Forrest looks at the various roles horses have played in the development of human civilization and how, in turn, these roles have shaped and determined the lives of horses. Beginning with the evolutionary journey of horses, she describes how the widespread impact of their domestication has virtually eliminated truly wild horses from existence. This domestication was driven by the enormous utility of horses for humans, who used them as a source of energy, as a means of transportation, as tools of war, and as food. In the process they became a unit of measure, a source of wealth, and a symbol for writers and artists of aspects of humanity itself. As Forrest demonstrates through her own investigative travels, the roles of humans and horses in each others’ lives remains visible today, from American farms to Chinese polo clubs.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
