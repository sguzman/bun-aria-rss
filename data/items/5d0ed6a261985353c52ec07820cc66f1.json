  "description": "This week Alaina covers a tale as old as time but with a modern MySpace twist. Two girls fighting over one dingus of a boy. Rachel Wade was living her best Bad Girls Club life, dating the quintessential bad boy, Josh Camacho. Josh Camacho was dating many other girls that Rachel didn’t know about though, specifically Sarah Ludemann. Instead of blaming Josh for being a two timer when they both found out about each other, the girls took out their anger on each other by fighting on myspace, through text messages and eventually voicemails. The tension between them kept getting higher and higher, and would eventually end in an explosive fight that would take one of their lives, far too soon.\n<br>\n\nAs always, thank you to our sponsors!\n<br>\n\nPretty Litter: Do what I did and make the switch to PrettyLitter TODAY!
