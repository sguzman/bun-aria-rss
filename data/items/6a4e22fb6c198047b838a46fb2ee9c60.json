  "description": "<p>When someone asks you how your weekend was, you don&rsquo;t start off by (potentially) boring them with the unnecessary details of how your Aunt Sally&rsquo;s train was late and you wasted your afternoon waiting &ndash; no! \n<br/><br/>\nGenerally speaking, you&rsquo;ll say &ldquo;it was great&rdquo; or &ldquo;it wasn&rsquo;t so good,&rdquo; and then go into more detail if the asker inquires further.\n<br/><br/>\nWe dare you to take this seemingly unrelated piece of advice and apply it to your blog posts and articles. \n<br/><br/></p><div><center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/vdY29Xe.png\" alt=\"get_to_the_point\"/></center></div>\n<br/><br/>\nInstead of creating a vertical &ldquo;freight train&rdquo; of graphs and content in your next blog post, consolidate the most important bits and get to the point faster using <a href=\"https://plot.ly/dashboards/\" target=\"_blank\">Plotly dashboards</a> and <a href=\"https://plot.ly/powerpoint-online/\" target=\"_blank\">presentations</a>.\n<br/><br/>\nIn this post, we demonstrate how a <a href=\"http://pitchbook.com/news/articles/a-snapshot-of-the-us-pe-middle-market-in-11-charts\" target=\"_blank\">PitchBook article</a>, chock-full of cool graphs and informative text, can easily be spun into a <a href=\"https://plot.ly/dashboard/Dreamshot:8424\" target=\"_blank\">Plotly dashboard</a> and <a href=\"https://plot.ly/~Dreamshot/8423/pitchbook-1/\" target=\"_blank\">presentation</a>.\n<br/><br/>\nThe resulting content is: \n<br/><br/>\n1. In One Place: It is <a href=\"https://www.nngroup.com/articles/scrolling-and-attention/\" target=\"_blank\">reported</a> that web users spend 80% of their time looking at information above the page fold. That should be incentive enough to produce a compact article and reduce the scrolling that is necessary. Plotly embeddable dashboards &amp; presentations can help you accomplish this!\n<br/><br/>\n2. Social Media Gold: Set your data into action and make an <a href=\"https://twitter.com/plotlygraphs/status/816851871600099328\" target=\"_blank\">animated GIF of your dashboard</a> for Twitter. \n<br/><br/>\n3. Downright Stylish: Plotly graphs and dashboards use D3.js, the gold standard of interactive web graphics. See for yourself, below!\n<br/><br/><b>Dashboard:</b> <a href=\"https://plot.ly/dashboard/Dreamshot:8424\" target=\"_blank\">https://plot.ly/dashboard/Dreamshot:8424</a>\n<br/><br/><b>Presentation:</b> <a href=\"https://plot.ly/~Dreamshot/8423/pitchbook-1/#/?_k=tu4ldl\" target=\"_blank\">https://plot.ly/~Dreamshot/8423/pitchbook-1/#/?_k=tu4ldl</a>\n<!-- more -->\n<br/><br/><br/><h2>1.

Turn Scroll-Fest into No-Mess</h2>\n<br/>\nInstead of forcing readers to scroll and view individual graphs, a dashboard can help you to maximize your space. \n<br/><br/><br/><h2>3. Cleverly Customizable</h2>\n<br/>\nYou can re-size, re-shape, and re-style the dashboard to match that of your organization. We did just that in our <a href=\"http://pitchbook.com/news/articles/a-snapshot-of-the-us-pe-middle-market-in-11-charts\" target=\"_blank\">PitchBook example</a>.\n<br/><br/><div>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/BfUOJie.gif\" alt=\"Customize_Dashboard\"/></center></div>\n<br/><br/><br/><h2>4. Content that is Perfect for Presentations</h2>\n<br/>\nAlternatively, you could embed a presentation in your article to truly eliminate the length and make the read completely undaunting to your readers. Plotly and Formidable&rsquo;s <a href=\"https://plot.ly/powerpoint-online/\" target=\"_blank\">Spectacle Editor</a> allows you to do just that. <br/><br/>\nSimply create your graphs on Plotly, download <a href=\"https://images.plot.ly/spectacle-editor/Spectacle.Editor-0.1.3.dmg\" target=\"_blank\">Spectacle Editor</a>, and bring your presentation to life.\n<br/><br/>\nFor more details on best Spectacle Editor practices, check out <a href=\"https://medium.com/@plotlygraphs/make-your-next-presentation-pop-8ff6e2371886#.aemumw3rp\" target=\"_blank\">our guide</a>.\n<br/><br/><div>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/jINq60S.gif\" alt=\"Powerpoint_Online\"/></center></div>\n<br/><br/><br/><h2>5. Presentations that Define Utility</h2>\n<br/>\nNot really digging the presentation-embed in your article? Cool, when you share the link to your post on social media, include include an animated GIF of your presentation with it! Or, use it to build the best talk during your company&rsquo;s next seminar and come away looking like the smartest person in the room. No more blurry, detail-lacking graphs &ndash; easy pan and zoom functions make it so even the person sitting in the way back can see exactly the moment that business was booming the most.\n<br/><br/><div>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/1jlD6hl.png\" alt=\"Graph_Zoom\"/></center></div>\n<br/><br/><br/><h2>6. Gamechanging for Social Media</h2>\n<br/>\nIf you article has 15 images, which are you going to use? It can be a tough decision. We want the decision to be easier and to boost engagement across your social media platforms. Quite easily take a screenshot (or two) of your Plotly dashboard and share that with your Tweet. GIFs are in, so if you have the technical know-how, pop one of those babies in and watch the retweets roll in.\n<br/><br/><div>\n<center><img src=\"http://i.imgur.com/CmoaG15.png\" alt=\"Social_Media_Graph\"/></center></div>\n<br/><br/><br/>  \nIf you liked this post, please consider sharing.
