  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, President Biden has announced a cancer ‘moonshot.’ However, he should focus on the lack of proficiency in American students due to the interruption caused by the COVID lockdowns. Unionization in public schools has been a tremendous disservice to students in our country and Biden isn't helping this one bit. The teacher’s union mob is the bought-and-paid-for militia of the Democrat Party. Then, Biden has destroyed medical innovation with his new price control plan starting in 2026. The United States will not be able to be the global leader in pharmaceutical research once its earning potential is capped by socialist price controls. Later, Debra Burlingame, sister of 9/11 pilot Chip Burlingame, calls in to discuss why it's wrong to negotiate with terrorists and eliminate the death penalty for Khalid Sheikh Mohammed and other Guantanamo Bay detainees. Burlingame added that too many have died for poor decisions like this to be tolerated. Afterward, Arizona Senate candidate Blake Masters joins the show with an update on his campaign. Masters highlighted why his opponent Mark Kelly will be a rubber-stamp for Joe Biden. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
