When we're not charging it on the card or spread paper thin desperately trying to fulfill all the heightened expectations this time of year presents, we find ourselves weathering an unnatural battery of social engagements and the emotionally hyper-charged land mines presented by extended family get togethers.</p><p>The result?&nbsp;A massive and unnatural outpouring of energy that leaves us not just out of balance, but utterly depleted — spit out the other side physically and emotionally exhausted to the core, all too often overweight and riddled with unnecessary debt.</p><p>Then what? We awake on New Year's Day committed to do and be better next time — the annual renewal ritual that inevitably falls short. A slow burn leading up to next November to repeat the cycle.</p><p>The standard American approach to the holidays is unhealthy, out of balance, verging on lunacy.</p><p>Let's have a different experience. Let's relax. Let's make sure we're exercising self-care. Let's focus on the giving part. And let's not over extend ourselves financially, emotionally or physically so we can emerge in January not just intact but truly enriched — optimistic, feeling great and energized for all the challenges and adventures presented with the birth of a new year.</p><p>As we did last November ( <a href=\"http://bit.ly/richroll60\" target=\"_blank\">RRP 60</a> ), this week Julie and I once again sit down to hash out all things holiday season with a focus on providing helpful, experience-based strategies to assist in managing the financial pitfalls, dietary challenges, precarious social environments and heightened emotional states presented by this unique time of year. In my experience, these are issues common to us all. And yet issues we go to great lengths to avoid dealing with internally, let alone discussing outwardly — typically out of fear, shame or simply a profound need to keep up appearances — all of which ultimately leaves us feeling alone and isolated in what for many can become a state of true emotional crisis. In truth, the exact opposite of what the holidays should be all about.</p><p>So rather than deny or repress, let's talk about it. Let's get it all out in the open. And let's work on a strategy for a better, more positive and uplifting experience. On today's agenda:</p><br><p>* How to avoid spending money you don't have;</p><p>* How to maintain a healthy diet throughout the season;</p><p>* How to experience gift giving with children in a different way;</p><p>* How to navigate and avoid emotional land mines with extended family;</p><p>* How to say “No” to certain social obligations; and</p><p>* How to nurture and preserve your physical, emotional & spiritual well being under pressure.</p><br><p>Many of the topics raised and discussed in this conversation are beautifully and concretely laid out in this very helpful companion piece by Julie entitled <a href=\"http://www.richroll.com/spirituality/how-to-maintain-emotional-financial-sanity-during-the-holidays/\" target=\"_blank\">“How To Maintain Emotional & Financial Sanity During the Holidays”</a>- well worth checking out.</p><p>It's about self-care people.
