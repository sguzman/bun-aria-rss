  "description": "<p>It’s time to party! During this episode we’re going to hear how many of y’all were able to get ahead with your personal finances this year. The ability for us to slow down and take the time to celebrate our money wins is going to have a lot of positive effects on all of us. Not only does it motivate you personally, but it gets others pumped who might be in a similar situation! And this is even more important after a rough 2020- considering that over 68% of Americans have reported experiencing financial setbacks this year, we need to hear some uplifting personal finance stories! Often we don’t celebrate after we’ve worked hard to achieve something. Sometimes there’s a tendency to have that onward and upward mentality, looking for that next best thing, but not today. Today on the show, we share our money wins for the year and we’re going to feature some of the awesome moves from the How to Money community as well. Thanks to all of you for being a part of this super fun episode!</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we both enjoyed a Winter Welcome Ale 2020-2021 by Samuel Smith. And as we’re looking forward to kicking things off with a bang in 2021, we could really use your help to spread the word- let friends and family know about How to Money!
