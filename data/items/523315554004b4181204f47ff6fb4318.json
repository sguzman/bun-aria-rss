Humphrey School and the Department of Political Science at the University of Minnesota. King is the Andrew W.

Despite its power and considerable resources, Jacobs and King claim that the Fed was asleep at the wheel when the recent economic crisis hit.

The authors dissect how the Fed’s programs during the Great Recession funneled enormous sums to a select few in the finance industry while leaving Main Street businesses adrift and millions of homeowners underwater.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
