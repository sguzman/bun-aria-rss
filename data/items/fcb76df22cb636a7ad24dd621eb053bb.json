  "itunes:summary": "God designed you with a purpose in mind. God loves you. He has a specific, unique and glorious destiny for you. He promises to guide you.\nGod’s purpose for you is bigger than your mistakes. I have made many mistakes in my life, but God has not stopped guiding me.\nWhen we go on a journey by car we use a GPS. When we take a wrong turn, it reroutes us. But it never gives up until we reach our destination. You can ignore it or switch it off but if you follow it, it makes your journey more enjoyable and peaceful. Eventually, it will say ‘You have reached your destination.’\nOf course, this is not a perfect analogy. God is not a machine but a person who is with us on the journey. God wants to communicate with you and has promised to guide you.\nThere are five main ways in which God guides us (the five CSs):\n\n\nCommanding Scripture (the Bible)\n\nCompelling Spirit (the Holy Spirit)\n\nCounsel of the Saints (the church)\n\nCommon Sense (reason)\n\nCircumstantial Signs (providence).\n\nIn each of today’s passages, we see first something general about the way in which God guides us, and then specific examples of each of these ‘five CSs’.",
