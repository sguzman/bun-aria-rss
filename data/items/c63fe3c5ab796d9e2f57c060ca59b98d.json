  "description": "<p>In this episode, John fires through a bunch of NFL headlines, including the Jags embarrassing week of cutting Leonard Fournette and trading Yanick Ngakoue, more evidence of Le'Veon Bell's decline, Mike McCarthy's paranoia on display in the recent Cowboys scrimmage without player names or numbers, more indecision from the B1G regarding playing a season, LSU wide receiver - and #1 WR prospect - Ja'Mar Chase deciding to skip the college season, the devastating loss of Derwin James and a rash of other impact injuries across the league, and why the Bears need to start Foles over Trubisky. He also answers listener questions in the Middlekauff Mailbag.
