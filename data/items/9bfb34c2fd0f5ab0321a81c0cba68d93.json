  "description": "<p>In the early 2000s, Clive Bates was one of Britain's foremost advocates against cigarette smoking and Big Tobacco. Today he is one of the world's foremost proponents of e-cigarettes as a way to help people quit smoking and reduce the harms caused by combustible cigarettes.</p><p>There's no better teacher about tobacco harm reduction than Clive, which is why I pressed him on the toughest questions: Aren't the risks of e-cigarettes still unknown? Shouldn't we be concerned about people developing a lifelong addiction to vaping nicotine? Isn't Big Tobacco just trying to hook a new generation of nicotine users just as the demand for cigarettes is declining? Is Britain's successful experience with tobacco harm reduction really a model for other countries. And, of course: what about the kids?</p><p>Listen to this episode and let me know what you think.
