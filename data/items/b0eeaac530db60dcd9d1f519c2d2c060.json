  "description": "<p>How do you forgive someone while still holding them accountable? What if that person is yourself? This week, our guest tries a practice in forgiving herself and someone else.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Episode summary</strong>:</p>\n\n<p>Anoosha Syed appreciates her name now, but as a kid, she struggled with feeling different from everyone else. She had friends call her “Annie” and even dyed her hair blonde in an effort to look less Pakistani. Anoosha joins us after trying a practice in forgiveness. Anoosha explores the complexities of forgiving someone who’s in a position of power and privilege and should know better, like the teacher who always mispronounced her name. Then, Anoosha took the practice a step further and directed it inward. She shares what it was like to forgive her younger self for not being as proud of her culture as she is today.  Later, we hear from psychologist Dr. Lydia Woodyatt about the power of self-compassion and affirming our important values to release us from destructive self-blame while still holding ourselves accountable when we need to.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Practice:</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Make sure you know how you feel about what is going on and be able to articulate it. Then, tell someone you can trust about your experience.</p></li>\n<li><p>Tell yourself <em>you</em> will feel better because of this forgiveness. Forgiveness is for you, not for others.</p></li>\n<li><p>Remember, forgiveness does not necessarily mean reconciling with the person who upsets you or condoning the behavior.</p></li>\n<li><p>Recognize that your primary pain comes from hurt feelings, thoughts, and physical discomfort you are experiencing now, not from the thing that offended or hurt in the past.</p></li>\n<li><p>Practice stress management to soothe yourself when you're feeling overwhelmed.
