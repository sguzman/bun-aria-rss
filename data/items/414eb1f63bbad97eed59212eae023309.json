  "title": "Top Chef’s Padma Lakshmi Serves It Up Tangy, Tart, Hot, and Sweet",
  "description": "From her Top Chef debut in 2006 to today, Padma Lakshmi has never wavered on the things that matter to her: women’s issues, immigrants’ rights, and global food and flavors. That’s why her cookbook, Tangy, Tart, Hot & Sweet, reissued last week in paperback, feels as relevant today as it did in 2007. The book is a celebration of Padma’s love for all cuisines and the people behind them, shaped by her travels around the world. Padma talks with host Kerry Diamond about favorite recipes from the book, her Hulu series Taste The Nation and what it took to get the show made, and the upcoming season of Top Chef. \n\nThank you to Crate & Barrel and Sitka Salmon Shares for supporting this episode.
