  "description": "<p>The Cigar Authority is the longest current cigar podcast on the internet today. 9 Years in and we’ve asked the listeners for some show ideas and today’s show is one of them. Almost 2 months ago Mr. Jonathan read the email suggestion and quickly went off on how bad of an idea it was. Well, that was enough for us to use the idea.</p>\n<p>Today we will share some of the movies we enjoy and what we feel is the right cigar to pair with them.</p>\n<p>During the course of the show we will light up two cigars with the first from The Cigar Authority Care Package being the La Aurora ADN Dominicano, better known as La Aurora DNA. In the second hour we will light up the King’s Treasure from the Contender’s Pack.</p>\n<p>We will have the usual suspects such as Versus, Offer Of The Day, Asylum, Classic 3-Way and Cigar News on the number one downloaded cigar podcast in the world.</p>\n<p>The Cigar Authority is a member of the United Podcast Network and is recorded live in front of a studio audience at Studio 21 Podcast Cafe upstairs at Two Guys Smoke Shop in Salem, NH and as always you can find many of the cigars we discuss at <a href='http://www.2guyscigars.com/'>http://www.2GuysCigars.com/</a>.</p>\n",
