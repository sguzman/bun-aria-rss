They’re also designed to last, with automatic updates for up to eight years that keep it running fast and secure. And all the Google apps that run on it — like Drive, Photos and Gmail — operate on Google Cloud, the cleanest cloud in the industry.</p><p data-block-key=\"5mse9\">It’s also easy to share a Chromebook with multiple family members so you can limit the number of devices in your household. You can add multiple profiles on one Chromebook — which keeps each person’s files, apps and settings separate — to personalize your device the way you like it, even when it’s shared.</p><p data-block-key=\"4n25c\">Don’t have a Chromebook yet? Modernize your existing device with <a href=\"https://edu.google.com/chromebooks/chrome-os-flex/\">ChromeOS Flex</a>. The cloud-first, fast and secure operating system for PCs and Macs gives you the sustainability-focused benefits of ChromeOS at no cost.</p><p data-block-key=\"5k6qd\">And when you’re ready to let go of your old Chromebook, we’ve made it easier to safely recycle them. Simply search for “electronics recycling near me” on Google to find verified services that can recycle your laptop for you.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"h-c-page\"><div class=\"article-image__is-caption h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3 h-c-grid__col--offset-2\"><a class=\"article-image--link\"><img alt=\"GIF showing a Google search for “electronics recycling near me” and a result in Google Maps.\" class=\"article-image--large\" src=\" https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_images/Recycling-near-me_02.gif \" tabindex=\"0\"/></a></div><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption article-image__is-caption-image h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"auk43\">Google Search can help you find electronics recycling locations near you.</p></div></figcaption></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"z17ii\">From launching sustainable devices with our partners to helping <a href=\"https://edu.google.com/intl/ALL_us/chromebooks/chromebook-repairability/?topic=acer\">educational institutions repair their old Chromebooks</a> (from Lenovo, Acer, and now, CTL), we’ll continue working toward a more sustainable future.</p></div></div></body></html>",
