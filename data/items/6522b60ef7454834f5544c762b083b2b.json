  "description": "The Good Morning Football Crew starts up the show with a recap of the best moments from Championship Weekend (:51) including the Patriots' epic battle over the Chiefs, and the Rams' controversial but well deserved victory over the Saints (5:55). The gang then gets into what they learned from the weekend, such as Kyle Brandt's discovery that this will actually be the rubber match between Sean McVay and Julian Edelman, who previously met in a couple MAC Conference games over 10 years ago (24:35),, and Nate Burleson explains why the Patriots' 4-running back backfield are the '4 Horseman' leading the charge to another Tom Brady Super Bowl (32:47). Lastly, Mike Garafolo joins the crew to teach some 'Journalism 101' to answer some of the tough questions that need answering heading into Super Bowl LIII, such as what will be the greatest weakness for the two remaining teams battling for the Lombardi Trophy?  (38:51). Be sure to check in every Wednesday to the GMFB podcast!
