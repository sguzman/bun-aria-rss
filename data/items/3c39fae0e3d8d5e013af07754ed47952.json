I know that there exists something, but I have no idea as to what this thing is. As Brian Davies points out in his book <a href= \"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Philosophy-Religion-Anthology-Brian-Davies/dp/019875194X\"> <em>Philosophy of Religion: A Guide and Anthology</em></a>, this not such an odd statement after all. Suppose I attempt to open a door, and something stops it from opening. I might say, ‘well something is certainly in the way’. If it makes sense to make this statement, it also makes sense to ask, 'what is it'?</p>",
