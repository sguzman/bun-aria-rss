  "description": "The \"official\" report from the Warren Commission states Lee Harvey Oswald acted alone in the assassination of President Kennedy. However over 60% of Americans believe otherwise. Could Oswald have been working with the CIA, KGB, or both? Did LBJ's desire to be President cause him to orchestrate the unthinkable? Was the mafia sending a message to Bobby Kennedy by killing his brother? With a laundry list of people that would have benefitted from Kennedy being out of the picture it's difficult to know who really was the mastermind behind the events of November 22, 1963. Of course it was probably Rafael Cruz and a poison shrimp dart.\nSupport Sinisterhood\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
