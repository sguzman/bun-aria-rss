Since there are a couple of problems with using GitHub profiles as a data source like this, I wanted to first\nlist out some of the issues I have with trying to assess developers by looking only at their GitHub contributions.</p>\n\n<p>One common misuse of GitHub profile data is in trying to filter out job candidates.\nPeople still seem to think that you can figure out how talented a developer is merely by looking at their open source contributions. As an example in the latest <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16492994\">Hacker News’ Who is Hiring thread</a>, there are a <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16493838\">bunch</a>\n<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16500583\">of</a> <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16493640\">different</a> <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16524380\">job</a>\n<a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16495405\">ads</a> <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16493780\">asking for</a> <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16495923\">a Github profile</a> <a href=\"https://news.ycombinator.com/item?id=16495273\">as part of the job application</a>.</p>\n\n<p>There are already a bunch of great posts arguing against requiring GitHub contributions as part of the hiring process. I particularly recommend\n<a href=\"https://www.ashedryden.com/blog/the-ethics-of-unpaid-labor-and-the-oss-community\">The Ethics of Unpaid Labor and the OSS Community</a>\nand <a href=\"https://blog.jcoglan.com/2013/11/15/why-github-is-not-your-cv/\">Why GitHub is Not Your CV</a>. While both of those posts give excellent reasons to\nreconsider asking for open source contributions when hiring, my take here isn’t about why it is ethically dubious to require open source contributions or why GitHub isn’t great for showcasing your projects.</p>\n\n<p>Instead, this post is about why GitHub profiles just aren’t all that useful when looking to hire developers.</p>\n\n<p class='more'><a href='http://www.benfrederickson.com/github-wont-help-with-hiring/'>Read more ...</a></p>\n     "
