  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, if the media believed in America and gave President Trump a chance we’d all be celebrating tonight. There is a coronavirus vaccine under phase three trial in just six months, this is an unheard of achievement. Anthony Fauci who has had nothing to do with the vaccine, says the vaccine will be available soon. The United States has tested more people than any other country in the world. All of this was done under Operation Warp Speed to accelerate the development and distribution of a COVID-19 vaccine led by the HHS, FDA, DOD, and other federal agencies and private labs. Somehow the President's critics in the media missed all of this. Then, the President's decision to nominate Col. Douglas Macgregor (Ret.) is disappointing. Macgregor has been soft on Iran in the past; he's no Richard Grenell. Iran is now negotiating with China for inter-continental ballistic missiles (ICBM's). Later, there isn't a single Democrat that has condemned the riots and anarchy. Not Nancy Pelosi, not Joe Biden, nobody. Afterward, the Affirmatively Furthering Fair Housing (AFFH) is becoming part of the national dialogue as it should. If Americans are unaware of this attack on suburbs that this is occurring they will be caught by surprise once it's too late.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
