  "description": "<p>First of all... HAPPY BIRTHDAY JOE!! Thanks for your podcast and all the hours of interesting shit you've provided.</p>\n <p>Â </p>\n <p>This partial week we're reviewing Jean Jacques Machado the legend of jujitsu and Bernie Sanders the presidential candidate. Luckily for you Adam loves jujitsu, trains with some greats and had a lot to add. Then as a suprise to Adam it turns out Mark knows a shit ton about politics and had some great things to say about what Joe and Bernie got in to. So enjoy people!!!</p>\n <p>Enjoy my review folks!</p>\n <p>Follow me on Instagram at <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/joeroganexperiencereview\">www.instagram.com/joeroganexperiencereview</a></p>\n <p>Youtube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6ilK4Zrqk2ZeowbOo7pXgw\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC6ilK4Zrqk2ZeowbOo7pXgw?</a></p>\n <p>Please email me <a href=\"mailto:Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com\">here</a> with any suggestions and questions for future shows..</p>\n",
