Every brand is looking for ways to flex their creative muscles via video marketing in engaging with their online customers. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Since more and more consumers spend a quarter or more of their time watching videos, businesses are using video marketing. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I’ve rounded up five video marketing trends I believe we’ll see in video marketing this year.</span></p>\n<h1>The explosion of short-form videos</h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The information age has changed the general attention span. With shorter attention spans,</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">less is more. People can consume the short-form video content quickly and capture the audience&#8217;s attention easily. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We also observed that brands have a strong preference in leaning toward short-form video content,</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> ranging from 20 seconds to two minutes. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">According to a study by Wootag, the audience overall prefers content between 15-30s with a minimum average view time of 11s which translates to a minimum reach of 50 per cent of the video watched. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Brands are also adopting innovative ways to increase completion for videos that are 30 seconds or more. In videos created by brands that are 30 seconds or more, we have seen brands adopting innovative ways to increase completion such as letting users watch more at the end of their 30s or enabling an interactive means to watch the remaining or building sequences.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Also Read: <a rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://e27.co/diversity-and-inclusion-marketing-campaigns-everyone-everyday-forever-20220312/\">Diversity and inclusion marketing campaigns: Everyone, everyday, forever</a></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you want to capture the audience’s attention easily, a short video across 15 to 30 seconds is your choice.</span></p>\n<h2>Live video drives far more engagement, the demand is increasing</h2>\n<p>A <a rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://www.grandviewresearch.com/press-release/global-video-streaming-market\">recent study projects</a> that the global video streaming market will reach US$184.27 billion by 2027. With 5G technology, it will open up even more new opportunities. Live video is a way to expand your digital presence and potential customer bases by attracting thousands of viewers on social channels.</p>\n<p>Moreover, live streaming leads to discussion amongst viewers. In general, it drives six times more interactions over regularly posted videos.  The raw footage with “no-retakes” creates a sense of intensity that isn’t as mimicked in pre-recorded videos and facilitates two-way communication.</p>\n<p>It helps customers know brands up close and allows brands to showcase their products or services in an authentic manner. Thanks to the direct interaction with audiences via live comments and Q&A, brands provide audience engagement to viewers which makes them feel like VIPs.</p>\n<h2>Interactive videos are booming</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interactive videos enable the audience to interact with the video content itself in a variety of ways (including branches, data inputs, quizzes). With interactivity, on average seven seconds are spent interacting with the elements of the video that promotes consideration of the product and/or brand itself.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through the branches, data inputs, surveys and quizzes, brands can understand the users who they are and what they are interested in. It can be an effective way for marketers to build their target segment.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Customised solutions and services can help business and finance brands to engage with their customers according to the needs of their audience. In the automotive industry, where promotions involve a more lean-forward experience with booking test drives, sign-ups for the latest deals and first come first serve services. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We have seen a jump in conversions through sign ups, product sales, and a minimum 4X uplift of awareness from the campaigns with the interactivity on our platform last year. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Men’s health company, </span><a rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://www.facebook.com/business/success/roman\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Roman, ran a very successful campaign</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> to educate users about their products using instant experience and doubled their CTR and sales with a 45 per cent higher conversion rate.</span></p>\n<h2>Shoppable videos will make a big splash</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We are entering the era of always-on shopping as we can window shop throughout the day digitally. According to Google research, 63 per cent of YouTube viewers in the UK say that they bought from a brand as a result of seeing it on YouTube. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Bridging the gap between discovery and purchase to deliver a seamless and personalised experience that exceeds customer expectations is critical.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interactive shoppable videos can simplify the purchase and allow customers directly experience the brand and shop within videos. It reduced customer frustration of constantly redirecting between advertisement pop-ups and websites.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Also Read: <a rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://e27.co/3-stages-of-marketing-for-your-startup-that-can-drive-effective-results-20220419/\">3 stages of marketing for your startup that can drive effective results</a></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Interaction in video improved overall customer experience, conversion and loyalty to the brand. On average, interactive shoppable video drove uplifted four times the traffic to the brand’s e-commerce site.</span></p>\n<h2>Data-led video marketing campaign will drive the success</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In the digital era, indicators like impressions, completion rates and clickthrough rates will allow marketers to quantify overall campaign performance. Beyond this, there are some ways to gain specific insights and measure them like other digital marketing campaigns to make your future campaign successful.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Through creating multiple segments and running individual tags per segment, you can build audiences based on various engagement parameters and personalise the video content. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Planning a device wise campaign is also a way to understand more the behaviour of your target audience and optimise your strategy based on the data.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Each of the campaigns has its uniqueness, utilising data to analyse and decide the time of interaction in the duration of the video, and real-world signals such as time, weather, sports, etc to create dynamic interactions are both vital to make the campaigns more effective.</span></p>\n<h2>In conclusion</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://e27.co/the-key-digital-marketing-tips-to-help-small-businesses-thrive-20210714/\">Video marketing has never been more important for brands</a> to connect with their audience, capture their behaviour and eventually nurture them to a purchase or conversion. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Under the new normal, marketers have to </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">integrate Video Marketing into their digital marketing and content strategy to reach and engage with audiences. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">You will capitalise on this growing segment to increase conversion rate, superior reach and deliver a personalised experience to audiences. </span></p>\n<p>&#8211;</p>\n<p>Editor’s note: <b >e27</b> aims to foster thought leadership by publishing views from the community.
