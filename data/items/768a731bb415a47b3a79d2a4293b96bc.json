  "description": "On today's show, Pat and the boys react to the news that covid is making waves in the NFL more as positive tests start to pop up throughout the league as Stephon Gilmore has now tested positive and the Titans held practices when they weren't allowed into the facility. Also joining the show is Super Bowl Champion, Pro Bowler, All-Pro, Pat's former teammate, legendary Indianapolis Colts and Iowa Hawkeyes Tight End Dallas Clark joins the show to chat about how difficult playing in the NFL under these conditions would be. Pat and Dallas also reminisce about old times, and much more (22:32-49:57). Later, CBS NFL color commentator, one of the voices of the Madden franchise, and friend of the program, Charles Davis joins the show. Pat and Charles discuss the covid outbreaks in the NFL and how they're going to adapt to everything, his thoughts on the Bucs/Chargers game which he called, and why he's very impressed with Justin Herbert, and everything else around the NFL (51:46-1:16:10). Last is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk where Pat and AJ react and discuss everything going on with the the outbreaks in the NFL, their Aaron Rodgers conversation from yesterday, and everything else going on around the league (1:17:51-1:36:37).
