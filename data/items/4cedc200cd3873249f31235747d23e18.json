  "title": "#242: Siriusly, Y’all! With Katie Cazorla and Julia Cunningham",
  "description": "<p>Ben is still out, so Ronnie called a couple more hilarious chicas to laugh our butts off at the ole Bravs this holiday season. Julia Cunningham from Entertaiment Weekly’s Sirius XM Channel comes on a blind date to talk Vanderpump Rules, and Katie Cazorla of The Nail Files and E!’s upcoming Second Wives stops by to talk about The Real Housewives of Beverly Hills: Uncensored. This is almost three hours long, and I’m grateful for these birds.</p>\n<h2>If you’re wondering where our Below Deck recap is this week, worry not! HUGE episode coming up with Kate Chastain and Nadine Rajabi to talk both parts of the reunion. Meanwhile, there are TWO bonuses this week (a trip through Housewives Instas with Angie Thomas and a trip through the brain of file master Katie Cazorla), so find them on Patreon!</h2>\n<p>Subscribe at http://www.patreon.com/watchwhatcrappens for bonus episodes, ringtones, and live group video chat parties.</p>\n<p>For all our other links and extras, go to http://www.watchwhatcrappens.com</p>\n<p>Ronnie on the Web: http://www.trashtalktv.com<br />\nRonnie on YouTube: http://www.youtube.com/trashtalkteevee<br />\nRonnie on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/trashtalktv<br />\nRonnie on Tumblr: http://trashtalktvrecaps.tumblr.com/</p>\n<p>Ben on the Web: http://www.bsideblog.com<br />\nBen on Twitter: http://www.twitter.com/bsideblog<br />\nBen on Instagram: http://www.instagram.com/bsideblog</p>\n<p>Our Soundcloud: https://soundcloud.com/watch-what-crappens<br />\nOn iTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/watch-what-crappens/id498130432?mt=2<br />\nFacebook: http://www.facebook.com/watchwhatcrappens<br />\n<br /><hr /><p>See <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://acast.com/privacy\">acast.com/privacy</a> for privacy and opt-out information.</p><p><a href=\"https://patreon.com/watchwhatcrappens\">Our Patreon Extras: https://patreon.com/watchwhatcrappens</a></p></p>\n",
