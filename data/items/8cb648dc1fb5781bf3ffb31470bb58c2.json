    "media:description": "What is homotopy type theory good for? In this video, I discuss the ideas of type-checking and formalized mathematics, and begin to describe how HoTT promises a new future for mathematics. \n\nThis the the first (or, rather, zeroth) video in a planned video series covering the basics of homotopy type theory. This is a reboot of the video series I started last year (https://youtube.com/playlist?list=PL245PKGUDdcN_MQ9LwnotqTHq2d_hpalJ) -- I got too busy last year with teaching and starting my PhD. Thanks to everyone who left kind comments on those videos, and encouraged me to make videos again!\n\nPardon my butchering of the German language.\n\nVideo site for the series: https://intro-hott.video\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL245PKGUDdcN9-El9D7DRefwX4c9feiYq\nInstagram: @Intro_HoTT\nTwitter: @Intro_HoTT\n\nFormalization links:\n- The formalization I'm developing for this video series: https://github.com/jacobneu/HoTT-agda\n- The formalization it's based on (by Egbert Rijke, for his upcoming textbook): https://github.com/HoTT-Intro/Agda\n\nHoTT textbooks:\n- The HoTT Book (2013) -- the original statement of HoTT: https://homotopytypetheory.org/book/\n- Introduction to Homotopy Type Theory, by Egbert Rijke (to be released): https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Introduction+to+Homotopy+Type+Theory\n\nSome relevant resources:\n- Article about Mochizuki's purported proof of the ABC conjecture: https://www.quantamagazine.org/titans-of-mathematics-clash-over-epic-proof-of-abc-conjecture-20180920/\n- Lean theorem prover: https://leanprover.github.io/\n- Good post describing more about different kinds of typing: https://thecodeboss.dev/2015/11/programming-concepts-static-vs-dynamic-type-checking/.

Python isn't truly untyped -- it actually has a type system -- but not a strong, static one like I describe here.\n- Resources page for Egbert Rijke's Introduction to Homotopy Type Theory textbook: https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Introduction+to+Homotopy+Type+Theory\n- Gauss kindergarten formula: https://nrich.maths.org/2478\n\nHomotopy type theory (HoTT) is a new branch of type theory and a new foundation for mathematics. It serves as a common language for reasoning about computation (functional programming), about mathematical structure (synthetic homotopy theory and higher category theory), and about constructive logic. This Introduction to Homotopy Type Theory video lecture series is intended to explain what HoTT is, show how to work in HoTT (including how formalization in Agda works), and give intuition for why HoTT is the way it is. I don’t assume any particular background familiarity, but the more you know about mathematics, computer science, and logic, the more you’ll be able to get out of these videos.
