  "description": "Our audiobook tease this week is Unforgettable by Delaney Diamond \n\nShe offered everything he never knew he needed…\n\n\nIvy Johnson is stunned when Lucas Baylor makes an appearance at her family’s event in Seattle. She hasn’t seen him in nine years and never expected to again. Avoiding him is a must. She can’t let him uncover her secret, but Lucas won’t be denied.
