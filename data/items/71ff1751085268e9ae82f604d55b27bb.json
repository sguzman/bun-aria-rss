  "description": "<p>NFL Week 6 is in the books and we start with Fastest 2 minutes (2:35 - 8:19). Battle of the wiz kids on Sunday Night Football. Doug Pederson has beef stew for brains. Texans rise up the good bad team power rankings. The ghost of Dan Quinn. Broncos win a game with field goals and the Steelers punk the little brother Browns. The Bears are 5-1 and no apologizing from Big Cat, Adam Gase is now commendable in how bad he is and the Bucs kicked the shit out of the Packers (8:19 - 94:08). Deion Sanders joins the show for big picture thoughts. (94:08 - 116:58). Football guy of the week and who's back of the week.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
