  "description": "We’re talking with Ashley Willis who is the brand manager at Malouf, a bedding company that we’ve been selling at Alice Lane Home for the last 5-7 years. We talk about thread count in sheets and the factors that go into having a high quality bed sheet, such as the high quality materials used like tensile, which helps regulate your body temperature as you sleep. Understanding your sleep preferences is necessary in experiencing the best sleep you can because not everyone has the same taste in bed sheets. Linen is durable, lasts a long time, and their linen is something that gets softer over time, the more it gets washed and is a favorite of many. They have various different types of pillows and Ashley talks about the various kinds and why they’re nice and how you can use each unique one for your comfort. <br /><br />How Malouf got started and what’s special about what they do 1:38<br />Thread count 5:48<br />Are there sheets for equalizing between two different body temperatures? 8:15<br />Getting that magazine look for your bedding 10:37<br />Must haves for your bedding 13:02<br />Different types of fills 15:24<br />Linen bedding or just sheeting? 16:25<br />Pillows, dos and don’ts 17:52<br />What people don’t think about 22:36<br />Top selling sheet, fills, and pillow 24:48<br /><br />“I think that sheets definitely serve utilitarian purpose in the sense that it’s the fabric that’s directly against your skin when you’re going to bed, but it also has a look to it, and so if you’re trying to bring in a very specific look to your bedroom, whether you want something that’s maybe warmer colors or cooler colors, also understanding what that looks like and how that plays in to the rest of your color palette for your space I think is really important as well.” 13:50<br /><br />@maloufhome<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
