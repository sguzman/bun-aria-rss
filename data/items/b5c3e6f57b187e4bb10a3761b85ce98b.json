  "description": "On the new episode of The Fred Minnick Show, Fred takes a different course. Rather than a one-to-one interview with another person, he asked his YouTube members to ask him questions they seek answers to. Most of those questions were about bourbon, whiskey, distilling and music, but some veered into other territories. Hold on to your hats.\n\nEPISODE SUMMARY\n\nYou get to hear Fred's answer to these (and other) YouTube member questions:\nWhat would be your go-to album and bourbon pairing to relax after a long day?\nWhat kind of music do you like?\nWhat is the first real concert you went to?\nFor a distillery other than differences in aging time or mash bill, are costs to get their product into a bottle somewhat similar across all their labels?\nHas Heaven Hill six year old been discontinued?\nBest MGP bourbon under $75 that is attainable?\nWhiskeys that have surprised or disappointed to you in 2021 so far?\nCurious if you have tried Joseph Magnus or Murray Hill Club?\nTop three drink categories and why?\n\nQUOTABLES\n\n\"I'm married to bourbon. I'm in it for bourbon, bour-bour-bour-bour-bourbon. After that, it's scotch and rum.\"\n\n \n\nBUY FRED's BOOKs: https://www.amazon.com/dp/0760351724/ref=as_sl_pc_qf_sp_asin_til?tag=httpwwwfredmi-20&linkCode=w00&linkId=2b446ca076adf46891c1dc14f2dc763a&creativeASIN=0760351724\n\nBOOK FRED On CAMEO:https://www.cameo.com/fredminnick?qid=1610485531\n\nFOLLOW FRED\n\nhtps://www.instagram.com/fredminnick/\n\nhttps://twitter.com/FredMinnick\n\nhttps://www.youtube.com/channel/UCyE_GJtYr3yowks2iv1o4jg\n\nhttps://www.facebook.com/fred.minnick/\n\nSPONSORS\n\nMichter's: https://michters.com/ \n\nDistillery 291: https://distillery291.com/\n\nSee omnystudio.com/listener for privacy information.",
