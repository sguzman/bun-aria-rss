  "description": "<p>This week on <strong>Life on Purpose</strong>, we celebrate a momentous occasion: my five-year podcast anniversary — during which time I've produced 56 LoP episodes and nearly 200 hour-long conversations overall!</p> <p>To help commemorate my journey, I'm joined by the man whose work and community inspired me to start my first podcast <em>(Radio Enso)</em> back in the summer of 2011: author and world-changer <strong>Chris Guillebeau</strong>.</p> <p><strong>Chris</strong> joined me for a wide-ranging, inspirational, and personal conversation centered around his work and philosophy <em>(\"There's more than one way to live your life.\")</em>; making deliberate and intentional choices in your life; asking, <em>\"How can I use my power for good?\"</em>; the changes and challenges he's faced since our previous conversation in 2012 including the loss of his brother; the annual gathering of world-changers and \"non-conformists\" that he hosts each summer in Portland <em>(WDS)</em>; his new book <strong>Born for This: How to Find the Work You Were Meant to Do</strong>; and MUCH more!</p> <p>About: <strong>Chris Guillebeau</strong> is a New York Times bestselling author and modern-day explorer. During a lifetime of self-employment that included a four-year commitment as a volunteer executive in West Africa, he visited every country in the world (193 in total) before his 35th birthday. Since then he has modeled the proven definition of an entrepreneur: “Someone who will work 24 hours a day for themselves to avoid working one hour a day for someone else.”</p> <p>His first book, <em>The Art of Non-Conformity</em>, was translated into more than twenty languages. His second book, <em>The $100 Startup</em>, was a New York Times and Wall Street Journal bestseller, selling more than 300,000 copies worldwide. That was followed by <em>The Happiness of Pursuit</em> — published in September 2014 and also a New York Times bestseller.</p> <p>And in his latest book <strong>Born for This: How to Find the Work You Were Meant to Do</strong>, he's created a practical guide for how to find the perfect job — whether within a traditional company or business, or by striking out on your own.</p> <p>Plus every summer in Portland, Oregon, Chris hosts the World Domination Summit, a gathering of creative, remarkable people with thousands in attendance. He's also the founder of Pioneer Nation, Unconventional Guides, the Travel Hacking Cartel, and numerous other projects.</p> <p>To learn more about <strong>Chris</strong> and his work, visit: <a href=\"http://chrisguillebeau.com/\" target= \"_blank\">http://chrisguillebeau.com/</a>.</p> <p>dukwb2y8</p>",
