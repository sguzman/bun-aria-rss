  "description": "<p>     This week Michael and Steve welcome two exciting guests. Al Sapienza who played Mikey Palmice, and Dan Grimaldi who played both Philly and Patsy Parisi. </p><p>     First up Al talks about how he got his start in the business. Did you know he played Ringo in Beatlemania on Broadway? Then he shares how a relationship with Jason Alexander got him the audition for the Sopranos. For Al, Mikey Palmice was the role of a lifetime and he was devastated when he heard he was getting whacked. He tried to talk David out of it, but in the end kept a positive attitude and went on to build a brilliant career after the Sopranos.</p><p>     Then professor Grimaldi joins the podcast. Dan actually has a PhD in data processing and still teaches at Kingsborough Community College. When Dan originally got out of grad school he went to work for Bell Labs and absolutely hated it. After only a week on the job he decided to quit and realized acting was the life for him. When Michael was young he used to love a horror movie called “Don’t Go In the House” which starred Dan Grimaldi. Then years later when Michael landed his first role in a professional play it was Dan who ended up playing his father. Strange…</p><p>     Then Michael and Steve get into the episode which was a big one for Joe Pantoliano. Joe won an Emmy for this season and sent this episode to the academy for consideration. Michael was also nominated that year and talks about what it’s like to win, and lose at the Emmys. There’s a lot in Talking Sopranos episode #49 “Whoever Did This” S4 - Ep9.
