  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, after 50 years of failed eco-pocalyptic predictions, we’re still here. Despite the warnings that acid rain, global cooling, and global warming would destroy life as we know it, we're still here. Even though we were warned that our children wouldn't know what snow is by 2016 or that there would be a global famine because of the weather by 1975. These headlines were all wrong but the left peddles these threats in order to control us and change our lifestyles and destroy the basis for the nation's founding — only then can the left remake our society and change our economic system. Then, although California had been granted a waiver during Ronald Reagan's Administration, President Trump has revoked California's waiver on emissions standards. With less reliance on foreign oil due to the CAFE standards that were a result of OPEC, automakers can build stronger safer cars that benefit human safety, not fuel standards. Later, it’s the idea among many that they don't trust government or politicians but the left just pushes more of it, even those apathetic to politics want more of it. Too often people conflate their misfortune or emotions with a need for more government. Afterward, there are cowardly members of both political parties that don't want our nation to defend ourselves or our interests by saying things like \"we can't get into any more never-ending wars.\" Iran is perfecting their aim with attacks on the Saudi oil field as an aggressive sign of strength and is a threat to the US military in our fifth fleet which is stationed in nearby Bahrain.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
