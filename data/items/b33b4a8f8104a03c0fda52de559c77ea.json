  "description": "<p><p>Kirk Minihane emerged from his court hearing yesterday a free man, but his fate is in the hands of a Massachusetts judge. Minihane offers his play-by-play of the court proceedings and thanks the Minifans for showing up for a #FreeKirk rally. A new educational initiative at a school in his town has enraged Minihane. The Minifans tick off a few more states on the march to 50. Blind Mike and Minihane team up to take down Kansas live during the show. Kathy Griffin is still butt hurt that people don't want to book her. The MLB is investigating an umpire for tweeting positively about President Trump. Minihane admits he reached a new personal low point last night.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
