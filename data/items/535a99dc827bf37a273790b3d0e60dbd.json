People find it amazing that some users spend thousands or millions of dollars on a single NFT-based image of a monkey or other token, but you can simply take a screenshot for free. So here we share some freuently asked question about NFTs.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">1) What is an NFT?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">NFT stands for non-fungible&nbsp; token, which is a cryptographic token on a blockchain with unique identification codes that distinguish it from other tokens. NFTs are unique and not interchangeable, which means no two NFTs are the same. NFTs can be a unique artwork, GIF, Images, videos, Audio album. in-game items, collectibles etc.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">2) What is Blockchain?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">A blockchain is a distributed digital ledger that allows for the secure storage of data. By recording any kind of information—such as bank account transactions, the ownership of Non-Fungible Tokens (NFTs), or Decentralized Finance (DeFi) smart contracts—in one place, and distributing it to many different computers, blockchains ensure that data can’t be manipulated without everyone in the system being aware.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">3) What makes an NFT valuable?</span></h3><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /></span><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The value of an NFT comes from its ability to be traded freely and securely on the blockchain, which is not possible with other current digital ownership solutionsThe NFT points to its location on the blockchain, but doesn’t necessarily contain the digital property. For example, if you replace one bitcoin with another, you will still have the same thing. If you buy a non-fungible item, such as a movie ticket, it is impossible to replace it with any other movie ticket because each ticket is unique to a specific time and place.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">4) How do NFTs work?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">One of the unique characteristics of non-fungible tokens (NFTs) is that they can be tokenised to create a digital certificate of ownership that can be bought, sold and traded on the blockchain.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">As with crypto-currency, records of who owns what are stored on a ledger that is maintained by thousands of computers around the world. These records can’t be forged because the whole system operates on an open-source network.&nbsp;</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">NFTs also contain smart contracts—small computer programs that run on the blockchain—that give the artist, for example, a cut of any future sale of the token.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">5) What’s the connection between NFTs and cryptocurrency?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Non-fungible tokens (NFTs) aren't cryptocurrencies, but they do use blockchain technology. Many NFTs are based on Ethereum, where the blockchain serves as a ledger for all the transactions related to said NFT and the properties it represents.5) How to make an NFT?</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Anyone can create an NFT. All you need is a digital wallet, some ethereum tokens and a connection to an NFT marketplace where you’ll be able to upload and sell your creations</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">6) How to validate the authencity of an NFT?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">When you purchase a stock in NFT, that purchase is recorded on the blockchain—the bitcoin ledger of transactions—and that entry acts as your proof of ownership.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">7) How is an NFT valued? What are the most expensive NFTs?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The value of an NFT varies a lot based on the digital asset up for grabs. People use NFTs to trade and sell digital art, so when creating an NFT, you should consider the popularity of your digital artwork along with historical statistics.</span></p><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">In the year 2021, a digital artist called Pak created an artwork called The Merge. It was sold on the Nifty Gateway NFT market for $91.8 million.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">8) Can NFTs be used as an investment?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Non-fungible tokens can be used in investment opportunities. One can purchase an NFT and resell it at a profit. Certain NFT marketplaces let sellers of NFTs keep a percentage of the profits from sales of the assets they create.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">9) Will NFTs be the future of art and collectibles?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Many people want to buy NFTs because it lets them support the arts and own something cool from their favorite musicians, brands, and celebrities. NFTs also give artists an opportunity to program in continual royalties if someone buys their work. Galleries see this as a way to reach new buyers interested in art.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">10) How do we buy an NFTs?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">There are many places to buy digital assets, like opensea and their policies vary. On top shot, for instance, you sign up for a waitlist that can be thousands of people long. When a digital asset goes on sale, you are occasionally chosen to purchase it.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">11) Can i mint NFT for free?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">To mint an NFT token, you must pay some amount of gas fee to process the transaction on the Etherum blockchain, but you can mint your NFT on a different blockchain called Polygon to avoid paying gas fees. This option is available on OpenSea and this simply denotes that your NFT will only be able to trade using Polygon's blockchain and not Etherum's blockchain. Mintable allows you to mint NFTs for free without paying any gas fees.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">12) Do i own an NFT if i screenshot it?</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">The answer is no. Non-Fungible Tokens are minted on the blockchain using cryptocurrencies such as Etherum, Solana, Polygon, and so on. Once a Non-Fungible Token is minted, the transaction is recorded on the blockchain and the contract or license is awarded to whoever has that Non-Fungible Token in their wallet.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">12) Why are people investing so much in NFT?</span></h3><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\"><br /><span>&nbsp;Non-fungible tokens have gained the hearts of people around the world, and they have given digital creators the recognition they deserve. One of the remarkable things about non-fungible tokens is that you can take a screenshot of one, but you don’t own it. This is because when a non-fungible token is created, then the transaction is stored on the blockchain, and the license or contract to hold such a token is awarded to the person owning the token in their digital wallet.</span><br /></span><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">You can sell your work and creations by attaching a license to it on the blockchain, where its ownership can be transferred. This lets you get exposure without losing full ownership of your work. Some of the most successful projects include Cryptopunks, Bored Ape Yatch Club NFTs, SandBox, World of Women and so on. These NFT projects have gained popularity globally and are owned by celebrities and other successful entrepreneurs. Owning one of these NFTs gives you an automatic ticket to exclusive business meetings and life-changing connections.</span></p><h3 style=\"text-align: left;\"><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">Final Saying</span></h3><p><span style=\"font-family: Comfortaa;\">That’s a wrap.
