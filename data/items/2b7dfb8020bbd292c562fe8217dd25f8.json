  "description": "<p>For axially symmetric accretion maintained in the hydrostatic equilibrium\nalong the vertical direction in the Kerr metric, the radial Mach number does\nnot become unity at the critical point. The sonic points are, thus, formed at a\nradial distance different from that where the critical points are formed. We\npropose that a modified dynamical sound speed can be defined through the linear\nperturbation of the full space-time dependent equations describing the\naforementioned accretion flow structure. The linear stability analysis of such\nfluid equations leads to the formation of an wave equation which describes the\npropagation of linear acoustic perturbation. The speed of propagation of such\nperturbation can be used as the effective sound speed which makes the value of\nthe Mach number to be unity when evaluated at the critical points. This allows\nthe critical points to coalesce with the sonic points. We study how the spin\nangular momentum of the black hole (the Kerr parameter) influences the value of\nthe effective sound speed.\n</p>",
