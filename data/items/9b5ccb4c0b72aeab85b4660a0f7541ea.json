This demonstrates Love, Bonito&#8217;s commitment to developing a full female ecosystem by acquiring an enterprise created exclusively for the average Asian lady. Adding sportswear as a new category is part of the company&#8217;s long-term plan to fulfil the diverse needs of women.</p>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Following the Series C fundraising, Dione Song, CEO of Love, Bonito, sees the launch of cheak as a pivotal moment for the company. Song noted that cheak will broaden the company&#8217;s long-held goal of becoming a true partner of the women&#8217;s fashion world, particularly in activewear.  &#8220;Merging forces with butter came at the right place and time&#8221;, she added.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\">Get cheak-y</h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">The sportswear line has been renamed cheak to mark the beginning of a new era following the merger of the Love, Bonito, and butter brands. This marks an important turning point in the evolution of the company&#8217;s commitment to empowering women all across the world.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_31848\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://asia361.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/BaseCore®-Sweetheart-Bra-and-Classic-Biker-Shorts-Baked-BaseCore®-Duo-Bra-and-Classic-Biker-Shorts-Baked.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-31848\" src=\"https://asia361.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/BaseCore®-Sweetheart-Bra-and-Classic-Biker-Shorts-Baked-BaseCore®-Duo-Bra-and-Classic-Biker-Shorts-Baked.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"676\" srcset=\"https://asia361.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/BaseCore®-Sweetheart-Bra-and-Classic-Biker-Shorts-Baked-BaseCore®-Duo-Bra-and-Classic-Biker-Shorts-Baked.jpg 800w, https://asia361.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/BaseCore®-Sweetheart-Bra-and-Classic-Biker-Shorts-Baked-BaseCore®-Duo-Bra-and-Classic-Biker-Shorts-Baked-300x254.jpg 300w, https://asia361.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/BaseCore®-Sweetheart-Bra-and-Classic-Biker-Shorts-Baked-BaseCore®-Duo-Bra-and-Classic-Biker-Shorts-Baked-300x254@2x.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">BaseCore® Sweetheart Bra and Classic Biker Shorts (Baked); BaseCore® Duo Bra and Classic Biker Shorts (Baked)</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">According to Tiffany Chng, co-founder of cheak, butter was renamed cheak, which is a play on the word &#8220;cheeky&#8221;, in hope that it will better capture the spirit of the new brand&#8217;s products. Everything about cheak was designed with the ambitious energetic girl in mind. A woman who is strong and self-assured, but also thoughtful and and exhibits a lively zest for life.</p>\n<h3 style=\"text-align: justify;\"><strong>From butter to cheak, it’s a perfect fit</strong></h3>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Olivia Yiong and Tiffany Chng, founded butter in 2020 to solve a dearth of inexpensive Asian-fit sportswear. Since then, butter rapidly built respect among the local fitness scene with over 100 instructors onboarded on their teacher program.</p>\n<div id=\"attachment_31850\" style=\"width: 810px\" class=\"wp-caption aligncenter\"><a href=\"https://asia361.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/BaseFlex®-Invert-Bra-and-Flex-Leggings-Blush-BaseFlex®-Asymmetric-Bra-and-Flex-Shorts-Lettuce.jpg\"><img class=\"size-full wp-image-31850\" src=\"https://asia361.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/BaseFlex®-Invert-Bra-and-Flex-Leggings-Blush-BaseFlex®-Asymmetric-Bra-and-Flex-Shorts-Lettuce.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"800\" height=\"533\" srcset=\"https://asia361.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/BaseFlex®-Invert-Bra-and-Flex-Leggings-Blush-BaseFlex®-Asymmetric-Bra-and-Flex-Shorts-Lettuce.jpg 800w, https://asia361.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/BaseFlex®-Invert-Bra-and-Flex-Leggings-Blush-BaseFlex®-Asymmetric-Bra-and-Flex-Shorts-Lettuce-300x200.jpg 300w, https://asia361.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/10/BaseFlex®-Invert-Bra-and-Flex-Leggings-Blush-BaseFlex®-Asymmetric-Bra-and-Flex-Shorts-Lettuce-300x200@2x.jpg 600w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 800px) 100vw, 800px\" /></a><p class=\"wp-caption-text\">BaseFlex® Invert Bra and Flex Leggings (Blush); BaseFlex® Asymmetric Bra and Flex Shorts (Lettuce)</p></div>\n<p style=\"text-align: justify;\">Love, Bonito chose buuter because of their Asian sensibility and commitment to establishing a strong female community.
