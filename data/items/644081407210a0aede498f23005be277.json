  "description": "<p>On May 5-6, 1864, the Union Army of the Potomac and the Confederate Army of Northern Virginia clashed in the thick, dense woodlands of Spotsylvania & Orange Counties; an area that was known as \"The Wilderness\" (the site of the previous year's battle at Chancellorsville). This engagement was also the first time that Robert E. Lee was pitted against Ulysses S. Grant, and it marked the beginning of the bloodiest military campaign of the entire American Civil War. On this episode, Avery, Codie & Tony are joined by Rebekah Ryer and Jeff Martin to hash out the beginning of the 1864 Overland Campaign, and Avery's favorite Civil War clash. The gang discusses the horrors of the battle, the role of leadership on both sides, and how the Union achieved a larger success at the Wilderness than history has given them credit for, as well as Grant's big ol' d**k! Strap in for one of our most fun episodes yet! Enjoy!</p>",
