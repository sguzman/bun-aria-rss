  "description": "<p>On this week's episode, the boys kick things off by ripping the NHL for their Olympic shortsightedness. As a 2010 U.S. Olympian and retired NHL player, Whits has a unique perspective to offer and he certainly does here. Next up, Eric Semborski (@sembo182) joins the show. The name might not ring a bell but Eric has one of the most unique stories in the NHL this year. He has already dressed as an emergency NHL back-up goalie twice this season. For two different teams. He fills us in on how things transpired so that a college club goalie came so very close to minding the net for the Blackhawks AND the Flyers. A wild story and fun interview. The fellas then finish things up by taking #AllRightHamilton questions from listeners.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
