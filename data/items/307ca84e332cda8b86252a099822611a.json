  "description": "<p>The boys are back, after a brief Thanksgiving break, and nothing has happened so insert the random shit! They start off getting into defining racism (don't cancel us, please) and discussing how this era of \"racy\" dress is worse than the Freaknik era. They get into a Thanksgiving recap, which somehow segues into a conversation about the double standards regarding sneaking photos of the opposite sex, and Mal asks the team to explain why a man would twiddle his fiddle while his significant other was in the house. They get into what demographics of men are the craziest exes (more stereotype jokes, again, don't cancel us), which leads to a discussion  about the appropriate house aesthetics to get women excited. In this episode, we also discuss how Rory had a bounty on his nudes, men's Mental Health month, the upcoming trials for Tory & Taxstone, as well as the unfortunate news of Virgil's passing.</p>\n",
