And those particular relationships have created conditions that sometimes allowed for the possibility of dissent and political protest, while at other times prohibited it from taking place, as a consequence of the types of structures, forces and against coercive capacities of particular regimes— which meant that people can take to the streets or not.\"\n\n\nMabon is Senior Lecturer in International Relations and Director of the Richardson Institute at Lancaster University in the United Kingdom.\n\nMusic for this season's podcast was created by Feras Arrabi.
