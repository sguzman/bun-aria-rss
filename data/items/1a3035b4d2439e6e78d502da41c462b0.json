Check me out live every weekday from 9AM-2PM: http://twitch.tv/Northernlion\n\nWikiArena is a cool game where you get a random pair of Wikipedia articles and have to choose either which one is longer or which one has more views. It's trickier than you'd think, and you might even learn something in the process. Check it out!\n\nIf you enjoyed the video, please consider hitting the Like button. It helps me out a lot! \n-----------------------------------------------\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/Northernlion\nFollow me on Twitter: http://twitter.com/Northernlion\n-----------------------------------------------",
