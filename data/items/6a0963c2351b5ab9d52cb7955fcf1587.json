  "description": "<p>Tonight I speak to a professional game hunter with over 40 years of experience in tracking and hunting wildlife. David said, \"I was trying out a new call to call in a predator and I saw what looked like a bear coming in on four legs about 400 yards out. It was coming right to me. At about 200 yards I realized this was not a bear, at 100 yards this thing stopped, smelled the air and stood up on two legs....I focused on it with my scope...I have a very detailed description on what I saw and I am not sure this was a Bigfoot I think it was something else..\"</p> <p>I also will be speaking to a gentleman who grow up around a property that had many strange encounters. He says that the family would find dead animals around the property like a bobcat that had been ripped in half. He would find strange tracks. One night they found out what was making the tracks and killing the local wildlife when a creature came to his back door. The same night the mother had an encounter on her way home from work.</p> <p>My last guest is Tara, who had two separate encounters but the one that has stuck with her is when she was at her husband's grandparents' for the weekend. She was taking a bath when she noticed a figure watching her from the window. She thought it was her husband playing a joke but soon realized it was NOT her husband and that the window where she saw the figure was 8 feet off of the ground.</p>",
