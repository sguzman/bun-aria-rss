  "description": "Today's episode is about how you're never alone. <br/><br/>That's because there are tiny mites that live on your skin — including your face. They come out at night and mate. And we're not totally sure what they eat. See? Don't you feel better already?<br/><br/>Researcher <a href=\"https://profiles.ucsd.edu/megan.thoemmes\">Megan Thoemmes </a>tells us about the lives of these eight-legged creatures — and what they can tell us about ourselves.<br/><br/>Also, if you can believe it, Short Wave launched a year ago today. Happy anniversary to us! And thanks for listening!",
