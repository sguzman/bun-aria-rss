  "description": "<p>This week, we look into a skateboarding icon, who many say invented the modern style of skating. He was just a kid, when he turned professional, but he certainly lived like an adult. An adult on the edge. He blew off commercials that he landed, and got into the LA punk rock scene, leading to his starting the ball rolling on a terrible murder of one man, and the near death of another. From there, his life continues to be a mess. He shoots cocaine, gets addicted to heroin, and makes terroristic threats. In, and out of prison, only to finally get out... and somehow be even weirder.
