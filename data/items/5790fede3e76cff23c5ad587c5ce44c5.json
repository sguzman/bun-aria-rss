  "title": "187 - The Kansas City Butcher: Robert Berdella",
  "description": "<p>Robert Berdella. The Kansas City Butcher. The Collector. An insanely depraved cook and former art school student who kidnapped, raped, tortured and murdered at least six men between 1984 and 1987. Bob was known to many in the KC area. He owned and ran a shop called Bob’s Bazaar Bizarre - a booth at the popular Westport Flea Market where Bob sold occult objects, primitive art from around the world, actual human skulls, as well as a myriad of other hard to find and generally dark items. And when he was arrested and the details of his crimes were revealed, the Kansas City community was shocked to find out what kind of monster lived amongst them. <br /><br /><strong>Listen to my new standup special \"Get Outta Here, Devil\" on Pandora</strong> right now for free: <strong><a href=\"https://pandora.app.link/Az9xIdU6s5\">https://pandora.app.link/Az9xIdU6s5</a><br /><br /></strong>Beta test Max Lazarau's new game, <strong>Football Legends! </strong><br /><strong>Youtube preview <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeTyCdXVS60\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=IeTyCdXVS60</a>  </strong><br /><strong>Discord link:<a href=\"https://discord.gg/auze9HS\"> https://discord.gg/auze9HS</a><br />\"Hang in There, World\" Campaign</strong> - <strong><a href=\"http://hanginthereworld.com\">http://hanginthereworld.com</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Watch my Amazon special Don't Wake the Bear</strong>: <strong><a href=\"https://amazon.com\">https://amazon.com</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>We've donated $5,000</strong> this month to the <strong>Meals on Wheels</strong> COVID-19 response fund.
