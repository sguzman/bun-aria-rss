  "description": "<p><p>On Thursday's episode of Spittin' Chiclets, the guys have their final interview of the West Coast Wagon Tour as they are joined by Teddy Purcell, the man behind the scenes for the whole trip. Instead of just chiming in on the interviews, we get a full interview with Teddy himself to find out what he is up to now, some funny stories and we are also joined by his dog Vedder. The guys also talk about some NHL news, starting off with some major milestones and a great night of hockey on Tuesday night. The guys also touch on the owner of an FHL team charging a ref which leads to the discussion of crazy owners and refs.</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
