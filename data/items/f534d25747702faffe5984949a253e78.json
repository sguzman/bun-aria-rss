Nevertheless, a good case can be made that the bottom-up and experimental nature of democracy actually makes for better problem-solving in the political arena than other systems. Political theorist Henry Farrell (in collaboration with statistician&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bactra.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Cosma Shalizi</a>) has made exactly that case.
