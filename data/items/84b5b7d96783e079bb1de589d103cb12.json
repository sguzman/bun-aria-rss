  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, the Senate needs to dismiss the articles of impeachment without any trial given the weakness of this process, but Democrats won't. Speaker Nancy Pelosi has destroyed the impeachment clause of the Constitution forever. When John Adams suspended habeas corpus and jailed journalists, was that worse than President Trump's phone call? When Abraham Lincoln suspended Habeas Corpus and shut down 300 newspapers, was that worse than Trump's phone call? When Woodrow Wilson jailed his political dissenters, was that worse than Trump's phone call? When Barack Obama, used the IRS to silence conservative groups that opposed him politically, was that worse than Trump's phone call? Sadly, too many so-called scholars don't understand the safeguards against a mobocracy. Yet, it remains that Trump has been treated worse than any other president facing impeachment in the history of our country when it comes s to subpoenas and the Impeachment process. Finally, Brian Hook, Special Representative For Iran And Senior Policy Advisor To The Secretary Of State, calls in to discuss the status of Iran.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
