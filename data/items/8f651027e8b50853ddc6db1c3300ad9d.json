This ensures that there are fewer issues to deal with when using the addon. We tested most of the links and they are working just fine. However, you might encounter the occasional issues found with other addons. Here’s how to fix them.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Error Check Log</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>As you continue to stream content with the addon, your backend data is stored and cached for easier access the next time you want to enjoy watching the same content. A filled-up cache causes the error check log issue to appear every time you launch the addon. You can fix this issue by clearing up your cache in device settings and rebooting the app. However, if you still see the error again, it’s time to install the addon afresh.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"gb-headline gb-headline-90005f0e gb-headline-text\"><strong>Stream Not Working</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This type of error is caused by a number of factors which may include a poor internet connection or broken links. Other times, your Internet Service Provider (ISP) may have blocked your access to certain sites. This could be the case if you live in a region/country where adult content is illegal to stream.&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Check that your internet connection is fast and try refreshing the link. You can wait up to 15 seconds for some videos to stream/load and start playing. Clearing the cache will also help fix this problem. If the error persists, then it is likely caused by a hosting error on the server.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"gb-headline gb-headline-db6e091e gb-headline-text\"><strong>Failed to Install a Dependency</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>A dependency error appears when there is a discrepancy in the python code dependencies of the addon. This can prevent you from installing any new addons. To fix this problem, check that you are using the latest version of Kodi. Also, clearing up the cache data will fix this issue.</p>\n\n\n\n<h3 class=\"gb-headline gb-headline-ebac4673 gb-headline-text\"><strong>Stream Authorization</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>This type of error prevents you from streaming content directly as you are required to enter a valid token to access content. While this is not a technical error of the addon, it prevents you from streaming popular and high quality videos.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>You can use debrid services such as Premiumize and Real Debrid to access high quality streams. To use these premium services you must first remove the free hosters from the app settings.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Matching the hosting sites with a static IP address will also fix this problem.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Is AdultFlix Addon Legal?</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>AdultFlix addon cannot be downloaded from the official Kodi repository. Also, the addon does not host any of its content but scrapes from other websites. This poses the risk of streaming copyrighted material which may put you at odds with your local authorities. So it is important to know which copyright laws are applicable to your country/region.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>FAQ</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Does AdultFlix Addon Use a PIN System?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>No, the add-on doesn’t use a PIN system. You will not be required to generate a PIN in order to watch content with this addon. Some popular adult addons like XXX-O-DUS and FapZone require users to enter a unique generated token in order to access adult content. This is not the case with AdultFlix and you can instantly watch adult content as long as you are 18+.</p>\n\n\n\n<ul><li><a href=\"http://www.prooffreader.com/use-and-install-xxx-o-dus-kodi-addon/\">Guide To Install XXX-O-DUS Add-on</a></li><li><a href=\"http://www.prooffreader.com/use-and-install-fapzone-kodi-addon/\">Guide To Install FapZone Add-on</a></li></ul>\n\n\n\n<h3><strong>Do I need a VPN to Unblock Content?</strong></h3>\n\n\n\n<p>Yes. We highly recommend using a VPN to watch content with AdultFlix addon. Your ISP may block you from accessing certain types of content, especially X-rated material. Getting a reliable VPN will unblock such content.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2><strong>Final Thoughts</strong></h2>\n\n\n\n<p>AdultFlix is a great Kodi add-on boasting of some unique XXX categories not found in most other addons. Cool features like Search allow you to find the exact type of content you&#8217;re looking for. The addon offers a wide range of content, more than any other adult addon currently.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.prooffreader.com/how-to-install-adultflix-kodi-addon/\">AdultFlix Kodi Addon | Install and Use</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.prooffreader.com\">ProoFFreader</a>.</p>\n"
