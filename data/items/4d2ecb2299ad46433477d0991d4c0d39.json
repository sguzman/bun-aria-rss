  "description": "<p>Veganism, is it the healthiest way to eat? Are all forms of animal products bad for you as some vegans suggest? If you are a meat eater are you destined for ill health and an early death? What does the science say? This conversation can stir up emotions, especially when extreme points of view are proselytized. The same kind of emotions that are stirred by religious zealotry. The same kind of emotions that some will experience when they read the extreme title of this episode! The Mind Pump position is that extremism (and being offended) in any form is rarely warranted. In this episode Sal, Adam and Justin set emotion aside (almost all, anyway) and look to science to reveal the RAW TRUTH about veganism. Please subscribe, rate and review this show!
