  "description": "Bourbon and ham, is that a pairing you would expect? To be honest, neither did I. I’m a sucker for killing a plate of prosciutto at a dinner party, but thanks to our guest Steve Coomes, we’ve discovered a new love for country ham. When done right, the saltiness of the ham just hits all the right spots. We sit down with Steve as he talks to us about a past life as a pizza judge (yes, a pizza judge!) and then we get into hams. The diet of the pigs, curing processes, and even his professional opinion of those ham legs you see hanging inside rickhouses. I think it will surprise you. Of course, it wouldn’t be complete if we didn’t do a bourbon and ham pairing. Try not to salivate too much.\nShow Notes:\n\nBourbon in a Decanter: Does is go bad?  https://advancedmixology.com/blogs/art-of-mixology/does-bourbon-go-bad-in-decanter\n\n\nThis week’s Above the Char with Fred Minnick talks about Derby.\n\nHow did you get into spirits writing?\n\nTell us about your bourbon and ham parings.\n\nTalk about your culinary background.\n\nHow do you judge a pizza?\n\nTell us about the hams you brought today.\n\nHow do you come up with the pairings?\n\nAre the pigs fed a specific diet?\n\nWhat is the difference in the thickness of country ham and prosciutto.\n\nTell us about curing.\n\nWhat sizes do hams come in?\n\nWhat flavors are you looking for when pairing?\n\nHow much does this ham cost?\n\nWhere can you buy country ham?\n\nWhat do you think about hams aging in rickhouses?",
