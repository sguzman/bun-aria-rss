  "title": "Amb. Marie Yovanovitch (Former Ambassador to Ukraine), Martha Stewart Takes The Colbert Questionert",
  "description": "Putin’s army is failing, in part because Russia’s oligarchs embezzled huge sums of money instead of upgrading gear and stocking fresh food rations. Over in Ukraine, members of the country’s prestigious ballet companies have put their careers on pause to return home and join the fight against Russia’s invaders. Meanwhile, Grimes and Elon Musk have done it again, and if you visit a museum in Denmark you can sit on a toilet shaped like Metallica drummer Lars Ulrich! Next, former U.S. Ambassador to Ukraine, Marie Yovanovitch, joins Stephen for a two-part interview focused on the latest developments in Putin’s invasion of Ukraine. Her book, “Lessons From The Edge,” is available everywhere next Tuesday. And Martha Stewart takes The Colbert Questionert, so we can all finally have an answer to the question: what is Martha's favorite sandwich?\nLearn more about your ad choices.
