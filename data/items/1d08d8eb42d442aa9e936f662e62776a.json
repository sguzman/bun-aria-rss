  "description": "<p>A witness contacted me and says he was hunting with a friend and they were being followed most of the night. They were unsure of what was pacing and following them. As the two hunters were leaving the area, they both turned around and saw a 7-8 foot tall creature looking around a tree at them. The creature did not flinch when they had their lights on him. The witness describes the creature’s face looking tired of like it had down syndrome. One of the hunters wanted to run but the men remained calm and slowly backed off and walk out. The witness who was in front said his friend screamed and bolted past him. He said that the creature had grabbed his backup light that was hanging on a cord and shook it.</p>",
