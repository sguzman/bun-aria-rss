  "itunes:summary": "Janet shares an exchange she had with a parent who wonders how anyone can possibly live up to the extreme idealism of \"gentle parenting.\" She writes: “It sounds so lovely… but it’s also crushing to never be able to live up to despite having all the tools and knowledge.” While \"gentle parenting\" is not a term Janet uses, she understands that it's a catch-all for recent discussions and news articles about parenting philosophies. In response, Janet shares her own mental and emotional struggles as a new mother striving for perfectionism as she tried to put Magda Gerber’s teachings into practice. She describes moments of frustration, feelings of failure and being judged, and how through her own experiences of self-doubt and criticism, she learned to give herself permission to be an imperfect parent in a process.\n\nThanks to BetterHelp for sponsoring this episode.
