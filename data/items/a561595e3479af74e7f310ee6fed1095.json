  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez claims we have a right to work, a right to a free education, and guaranteed healthcare paid for by the state. These demands sound exactly from chapter ten of Stalin's Soviet platform for \"democracy.\" Totalitarians like Joseph Stalin are role models to Marxists like Cortez and the Democrats. Her speech made no mention of liberty or individualism. Later, Barack Obama lies just like his Party and blames Trump for U.S. coronavirus deaths yet nine of the top ten states leading the death toll are led by blue-state Democrats. This must be clearly articulated by the Republicans at the RNC Convention next week! Afterward, an anonymous employee at Goodyear was told what they could and couldn't wear; allowing Black Lives Matter, but rejecting Blue Lives Matter apparel. As this information was leaked, Goodyear tried to backtrack saying that they didn't support political speech in the workplace. Despite the company's support for BLM which is still political speech, it disallowed Blue Lives Matter which in much the same way is an equity issue like BLM supporting the lives and safety of law enforcement.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
