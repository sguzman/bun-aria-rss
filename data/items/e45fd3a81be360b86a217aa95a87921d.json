  "description": "<p><p>Ari Shaffir stopped by the studio one day removed from #SoberOctober. He might have still been drunk and handed out edibles. He told us about how he cheated on a typing test to pass and journalism class, why Bert Kreischer is a horrible human being and what Joe Rogan smells like. John went to another musical but he's still not gay. Voicemails include: why can't I use a wheelchair, and getting banned from a school you don't go to.</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
