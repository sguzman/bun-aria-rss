  "description": "<p>NEVER BE CLOSING. A lot of books about selling encourage you to act like someone you’re not. They tell you to say the other person’s name. Copy their body language. Become a salesman. But what if the key to selling is accepting who you are? What if everything weird about you is what will make you successful? Stop thinking of business as transactional. Instead, be generous. Play the long game. And be kind. On today’s episode of The School of Greatness, I talk about the soulful art of persuasion with an expert in marketing: Jason Harris. Jason Harris is the CEO of the award-winning creative agency Mekanism and the co-founder of the Creative Alliance. Harris works closely with brands through a blend of soul and science to create provocative campaigns that engage audiences.
