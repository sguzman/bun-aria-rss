  "title": "Alastair Reynolds, “Blue Remembered Earth” (Gollancz, 2012)",
  "description": "Blue Remembered Earth (Gollantz, 2012) takes place roughly 150 years in the future. Climate change, as well as the political and economic rise of Africa, have transformed the planet. Humanity is colonizing the solar system. Geoffrey Akinya, grandson of a visionary businesswoman, cares most about his scientific work with elephants. His sister, Sunday, pursues the life of an artist in an anarchic commune on the moon. But their grandmother’s death sets in motion an interplanetary treasure hunt with the potential to change humanity’s future.\n\nAlastair Reynolds‘ latest book has received much critical praise; there’s a sense among some science-fiction writers and fans that Blue Remembered Earth marks an important development in the genre itself. Whatever readers may think of it, Reynolds is a gregarious and fascinating interview subject, and I’m very pleased that he agreed to record this podcast.\n\nAlastair Reynolds was born in 1966 in Wales. He holds a PhD in Astronomy and worked at the European Space Agency. His novel Chasm City won the 2002 BSFA, and nearly every one of his novels has been shortlisted for a major award. Reynolds is probably best known for his Revelation Space series. He is currently working on a sequel to Blue Remembered Earth and a Dr. Who novel.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
