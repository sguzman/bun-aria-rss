  "description": "<p>\n      When an optimization problem has multiple global minima, different algorithms can find different solutions, a phenomenon often referred to as the <i>implicit bias</i> of optimization algorithms. In this post we'll characterize the implicit bias of gradient-based methods on a class of regression problems that includes linear least squares and Huber â€¦</p>",
