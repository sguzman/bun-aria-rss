  "description": "Well Alaina can't do it. She can't stay mini and she won't! Honestly, this was supposed to be a real mini but then I found another source and things got wild. Thanks for appreciating my lack of brevity on the regular, weirdos. <br>\n<br>\nThis case is WILD. Zach Bowen and Addie Hall were two 20-somethings experiencing a whirlwind romance in New Orleans in the early 00s. Both had a free spirit way about them, they loved fiercely and they seemed to carve out a niche as the king and queen of the French Quarter misfits. But they both had a dark side and we all know everything done in the dark comes to the light eventually. This murder/suicide has twists, turns, romance, violence and worst of all, a truly tragic end for two people who could have lived, had they realized they needed to do that apart. <br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Shake-Devil-Off-Murder-Orleans-ebook/dp/B003G93ZFE/ref=sr_1_2?dchild=1&keywords=Ethan+brown&qid=1591015944&sr=8-2\" target=\"_blank\">Shake The Devil Off by Ethan Brown</a><br>\n<br>\n<strong>Thanks to our sponsors!<br>\n<br>\nPurple</strong><br>\nExperience the next evolution of sleep.
