  "description": "JK McKnight, Founder and Captain of Forecastle Festival, talks about running a music festival and how their Bourbon Lodge has become a festival of itself.\nShow Notes:\n\nIf you’re a music lover, you’re going to enjoy this episode. We’ve been to forecastle a few times and we’ll talk about why our guest is here talking about Bourbon a bit later, but music festivals are just fun. There’s no better way to put it than that.\n\nExplain to everyone who isn’t up to speed on music festivals, what is Forecastle.\n\nI went to Forecastle back in 2008 to see Counting Crows and 2010 to see Widespread.\n\nWhat’s the history? Why did you start it, what was the idea? How big has it grown?\n\nI know you also are starting to get a little bit of growth in the EDM tent.\n\nI believe this is the 5th year in a row you all are featuring the “bourbon lodge”. talk about what it is.\n\nWhat was the idea behind drinking bourbon in 100 degree weather in the middle of July?\n\nHow has the lodge progressed from when you first started it? - It seems like you’ve got everyone on board now. There’s bulleit, woodford, four roses, jim beam, larceny of heaven hill, maker’s mark, michaels, old forester, and wild turkey. pretty much all the big guns.\n\nInstead of a beer garden, you all have a bourbon garden.\n\nCocktails sound more up my alley in the July heat. i see there is a mixology station and signature cocktails.\n\nTalk about the food because you have a friend of the show taking care of that for you.\n\nLastly is a rarities bar sponsored by Liquor Barn.\n\nforecastlefest.com/bourbonlodge",
