  "description": "<p>One thing History Goes Bump knows is ghost tours. We've been joined by several tour guides on the podcast and on this episode, we are joined by our favorite, Cedric. Cedric has served our country in the military, worked as a Firefighter/Medic and founded a company creating leathercraft for the movies. He and his wife Eevie are also tour guides in New Orleans and he is an amazing storyteller. On top of that, Cedric and Eevie have their own paranormal investigation group called N.O.P.E. Cedric joins us to share his techniques and experiences while ghost hunting and to talk about some of the haunts in New Orleans, particularly in the French Quarter. Join us as we discuss ghost hunting New Orleans and beyond! The Moment in Oddity was suggested by Scott Booker and Paula Mitchell and features the Corpse Flower and This Month in History features the birth of Maggie Kuhn, Gray Panther founder.</p> <p>Our sponsor for this episode is HelloFresh, get 14 free meals plus free shipping by going to https://hellofresh.com/bump14 and enter code bump14</p> <p>Check out the website: http://historygoesbump.com<br /> <br /> Show notes can be found here: https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2021/08/hgb-ep-397-ghost-hunting-new-orleans.html</p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</p> <p>Music used in this episode:</p> <p>Main Theme: Lurking in the Dark by Muse Music with Groove Studios</p> <p>(Moment in Oddity) Vanishing by Kevin MacLeod<br /> Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/4578-vanishing<br /> License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p> <p>(This Month in History) In Your Arms by Kevin MacLeod<br /> Link: https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/song/3906-in-your-arms<br /> License: https://filmmusic.io/standard-license</p> <p>Outro Music: Happy Fun Punk by Muse Music with Groove Studios</p> <p>All other music licensing: PODCASTMUSIC.COM License Synchronization, Mechanical, Master Use and Performance Direct License for a Single Podcast Series under current monthly subscription.</p>",
