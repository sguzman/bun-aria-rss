  "description": "On Friday’s Mark Levin Show, WABC host Rich Valdes, Mr. Call Screener, fills in for Mark. The government didn’t build America – we the people did. The people used the free market to build the America that we love! You don’t look to the government to provide for you when you’re thankful for and able to receive the blessings that America offers. When was the last time you heard a leftist thank God for America? Also, a poll shows that most people want ‘Blue Lives Matter’ laws to protect police. Cops need to be protected because they have a target on their back thanks to the democrats. Democrats no longer support law and order and we are paying that price. Then, Joe Biden and the Democrats have not been a friend to Hispanics and Puerto Rico. Alexandria Ocasio Cortez is part of the reason that Biden is suffering from a lack of Hispanic support. Later, Ruth Bader Ginsburg has passed away at 87 from metastatic pancreatic cancer.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
