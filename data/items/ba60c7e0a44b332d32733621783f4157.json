  "description": "What is it about looking up at the night sky that fills us with hope and amazement? The beauty, the possibilities, or perhaps … aliens? In this episode of \"The Glenn Beck Podcast,\" Canadian professor and cultural firebrand Jordan Peterson breaks down all three and ties this hope to something he and Glenn agree is being destroyed by the modern cancel culture: The ability to forgive and forget. Peterson is no stranger to the unforgiving mob, and his latest book, “Beyond Order: 12 More Rules,” faced woke outcries before it was even published! He dives into these new rules and more — technology, mythology, religion, college brainwashing, Star Wars, discount Karl Marx dolls, and plenty more sources of chaos and order that amaze and terrify us all.\n \nSponsor:\n\nStaying healthy is tough, especially if you have a sweet tooth.\nFortunately, there’s Built Bars! They’re made with real chocolate, high in protein and low in calories and carbs, and taste exactly like a candy bar.
