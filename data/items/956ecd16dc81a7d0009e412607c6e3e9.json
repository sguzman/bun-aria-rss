When you sign up to donate monthly to a nonprofit on Facebook, Meta will match 100% of your donation after you make your second monthly donation. We’ll match up to $100 per donation, $100,000 per nonprofit and up to $7 million in total across all organizations. This is a shift from how we’ve historically matched one-time donations on GivingTuesday. As we celebrate the 10th anniversary of this global day of giving, we look forward to helping organizations sustain support far beyond the holidays.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">To be eligible for our match, people in the US can sign up to donate monthly between November 15 and December 31, 2022. We’ll continue covering donation processing fees so everything raised through fundraisers on our platform goes directly to the organization you support. </span></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-36717\" src=\"https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/01_Metas-Match-1.png?resize=890%2C775\" alt=\"Product mock showing monthly donation match on Facebook\" width=\"890\" height=\"775\" srcset=\"https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/01_Metas-Match-1.png?resize=890%2C775?w=1920 1920w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/01_Metas-Match-1.png?resize=890%2C775?w=300 300w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/01_Metas-Match-1.png?resize=890%2C775?w=768 768w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/01_Metas-Match-1.png?resize=890%2C775?w=1024 1024w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/01_Metas-Match-1.png?resize=890%2C775?w=1536 1536w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/01_Metas-Match-1.png?resize=890%2C775?w=1240 1240w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/01_Metas-Match-1.png?resize=890%2C775?w=689 689w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/01_Metas-Match-1.png?resize=890%2C775?w=1780 1780w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 890px) 100vw, 890px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p><img loading=\"lazy\" class=\"aligncenter size-full wp-image-36662\" src=\"https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/02_About-Metas-Match.png?resize=890%2C775\" alt=\"Product mock showing monthly donation match on Facebook\" width=\"890\" height=\"775\" srcset=\"https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/02_About-Metas-Match.png?resize=890%2C775?w=1920 1920w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/02_About-Metas-Match.png?resize=890%2C775?w=300 300w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/02_About-Metas-Match.png?resize=890%2C775?w=768 768w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/02_About-Metas-Match.png?resize=890%2C775?w=1024 1024w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/02_About-Metas-Match.png?resize=890%2C775?w=1536 1536w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/02_About-Metas-Match.png?resize=890%2C775?w=1240 1240w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/02_About-Metas-Match.png?resize=890%2C775?w=689 689w, https://about.fb.com/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/02_About-Metas-Match.png?resize=890%2C775?w=1780 1780w\" sizes=\"(max-width: 890px) 100vw, 890px\" data-recalc-dims=\"1\" /></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://socialimpact.facebook.com/giving-season-match-terms\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Learn more</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> about our donation match and find an eligible nonprofit to support monthly at </span><a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/fundraisers\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">www.facebook.com/fundraisers</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">. </span></p>\n<h2>New Data on Nonprofit Connections</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">People make donations — big and small — every day using our technologies, and they add up to real positive impact.

She uses Facebook and Instagram to help raise the money she needs to care for the horses, find volunteers and share uplifting stories. Our technologies help organizations like Clare’s nonprofit connect directly with its large community of supporters.</span></p>\n<div class=\"fb-video\" data-allowfullscreen=\"true\" data-href=\"https://www.facebook.com/MetaNewsroom/videos/1481472255598048/\"></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/11/fundraise-for-nonprofits-giving-season/\">New Way to Support Nonprofits This Giving Season</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://about.fb.com\">Meta</a>.</p>\n",
