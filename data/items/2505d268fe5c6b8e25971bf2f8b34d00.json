  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, Speaker Nancy Pelosi calls for Joe Biden not to debate President Trump. In truly fascistic fashion she claims Trump doesn't deserve a debate because he hasn't comported himself appropriately. They fail to realize that these presidential debates are for the American people. Then, Kamala Harris is giving the response to the President's speech at the Republican convention, which is odd given she's not the president's opponent. The Biden / Sanders Unity document on Biden's website is a damnable document that reveals the Democrats' true agenda. They continue to portray Biden as the candidate that doesn't campaign because he follows the science. Later, Trump has done an extraordinary job handling the coronavirus; the mortality rate in the United States is one of the lowest and the testing rate is the highest. Attorney General Bill Barr is now investigating mortality rates in several states across the U.S. Plus, Liberty provides every citizen the opportunity to make it in this country. Some athletes, like Malcolm Jenkins and others, take to the media to spew nonsense when not a single one of them has given up their wealth to live among the poor they claim to defend, yet they're quick to take up Marxist rhetoric on these issues. Afterward, Carter Page, former Trump campaign advisor and Author of the new book Abuse and Power: How an Innocent American Was Framed in an Attempted Coup Against the President, joins the show. Page discusses how the media and corrupt democrats in the Department of Justice set him up, doctored documents, and lied in order to spy on him and the Trump campaign. Finally, former Israeli Ambassador to the U.S, Michael Oren, author of the new book, The Night Archer: and Other Stories calls in. Oren lauded the Trump peace deal as unprecedented since it’s the first peace deal negotiated where Israel didn't have to give up any land and where Arab partners are looking to get more involved.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
