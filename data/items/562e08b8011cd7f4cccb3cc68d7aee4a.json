  "title": "186 - The Sex Suck: Who's Doing What, Female Ejaculation, and More!",
  "description": "<p>Let's talk about sex! What is \"normal\" based on data? Who’s having sex? What kinds of sex are they having? Are you having more or less sex than the average Meatsack? Are you having freakier sex? Or is it pretty vanilla? Gonna talk about kink today. What kinds of kinks are out there? Are you kinky? Why do we like kink? Why do so many get turned on by getting tied up or spanked or playing dress-up? Gonna talk about porn! How much is out there? Is it bad for you? Good for you? Both? Gonna talk about sex robots. How will they change the future of human sexuality? And yes, Space Lizards, we will talk about female ejaculation. We will learn so much about the activity that brought you here and an activity many of our lives seems to revolve around, today, on Timesuck!
