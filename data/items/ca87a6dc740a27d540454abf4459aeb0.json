  "description": "A swathe of draconian abortion laws have been passed by states around the country in the past few weeks, but Alabama outdid them all. Legislators there are clearly hoping Justice Kavanagh will nullify Roe v Wade with a stroke of a pen, but there are quite a few other factors at play here and this week Dahlia Lithwick is joined by just the right women to explore those factors. Professor of Law Melissa Murray of NYU discusses the history and significance of Roe, and CNN legal analyst Joan Biskupic, who also authored the new book “The Chief, the Life and Turbulent times of Chief Justice John Roberts”, joins Dahlia to dissect Roberts’ record and reservations when it comes to reproductive rights. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
