  "description": "<p>We study the existence and regularity of local times for general\n$d$-dimensional stochastic processes. We give a general condition for their\nexistence and regularity properties. To emphasize the contribution of our\nresults, we show that they include various prominent examples, among others\nsolutions to stochastic differential equations driven by fractional Brownian\nmotion, where the behavior of the local time was not fully understood up to now\nand remained as an open problem in the stochastic analysis literature. In\nparticular this completes the picture regarding the local time behavior of such\nequations, above all includes high dimensions and both large and small Hurst\nparameters. As other main examples, we also show that by using our general\napproach, one can quite easily cover and extend some recently obtained results\non the local times of the Rosenblatt process and Gaussian quasi-helices.\n</p>",
