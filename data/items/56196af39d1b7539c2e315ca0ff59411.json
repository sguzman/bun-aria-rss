  "description": "<p>On today’s show, Pat recaps his insane weekend starting with commentating SmackDown Live! on FOX on Friday night which included being lucky enough to have Jim Irsay lend him his private jet so that he could get to Buffalo in time for the show, and ending with Pat heading to Memphis to be on College Gameday on Beale St. Pat and the boys also recap everything that happened this weekend in the NFL including the Steelers pulling out an impressive win over the Colts in Pittsburgh, the Seahawks starting to come on strong and why no one is really talking about them, Lamar Jackson looking incredibly against the Patriots on Sunday night, DeShaun Watson and Stefon Diggs marketing Popeye’s, and everything else that was important around the league. Pat also breaks down Vinny’s game winning kick opportunity and why it was an operational failure and not necessarily all Vinny’s fault, and breaks down the proper way to hold the football on a field goal attempt and what the holder, long snapper, and kicker’s individual responsibilities are. Also joining the show is arguably the greatest sportscaster in the business. You’ve heard him call the Super Bowl, World Series, and US Open, consummate professional and hilarious human, Joe Buck. Joe and Pat discuss his thoughts on a lot of the good team’s in the NFL laying an egg this past weekend, why people hate him and where he thinks that comes from, his thoughts on the NFL so far this season and his feelings on all the issues with the referees, whether or not he appreciates tanking in the NFL and if he thinks it will be a viable option moving forward, and what the most memorable moment from his career has been thus far (1:06:40-1:21:56). Don’t forget to watch this week’s vlog recapping Pat’s entire week at <a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow\">www.youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow</a> Today’s a fun one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
