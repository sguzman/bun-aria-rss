  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show the pro-abortion, leftist death cult continues to meltdown in spasms of demonic rage over the Texas abortion law. We'll talk about that. Also, a new report says that half of the nation's children are overweight or obese. I wonder if keeping them cooped up inside for a year and a half could have something to do with that? And the Bachelor contestant canceled a few months ago for going to an old south themed frat party has hit the interview circuit for her apology tour and it's incredibly embarrassing to watch as you might expect. Plus, fast food restaurants are so desperate for workers that they're now advertising openings for 14 and 15 year olds. Some people are upset about this, apparently, but I think it's a good thing. \nSubscribe to Morning Wire, Daily Wire’s new morning news podcast, and get the facts first on the news you need to know: https://utm.io/udyIF\nLearn more about your ad choices.
