  "description": "<p>January 1st, 2008. Irving, Texas. Sarah and Amina Said were two normal, happy teenage girls trying their best to live a regular life. Unfortunately, they lived with an angry, abusive father, a mother too afraid to protect her children, and a brother who provided support to their father. On January 1st, 2008 Yaser Said murdered his two daughters, abandoning their bodies in his taxi and going into hiding. In an image that is now a representative for this case, just a few days before her death, Amina posted a picture of herself online with the caption, “I don’t want to become a memory.” Amina and Sarah knew how dangerous their situation was, but they had no one to protect them.
