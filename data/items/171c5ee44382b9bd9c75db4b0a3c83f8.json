  "description": "<p>The Gunter Hotel is a historic hotel owned by Sheraton that is located in beautiful San Antonio, Texas. The hotel provides high end accommodations and amenities that include an old time barber shop. There is more than meets the eye at the Gunter Hotel though. A long history that includes a horrific murder mystery has led many to believe that the hotel is haunted. And based on people's experiences, this hotel very well could be host to at least one restless spirit. The Moment in Oddity features Sailing Stones and This Day in History features Joan of Arc burned at the stake.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/05/hgb-podcast-ep-47-gunter-hotel.html\">http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/05/hgb-podcast-ep-47-gunter-hotel.html</a></p>",
