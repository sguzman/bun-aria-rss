    "media:description": "Primes are the building blocks of math. But just how mysterious are they?\n\nOur study of prime numbers dates back to the ancient Greeks who first recognized that certain numbers can't be turned into rectangles, or that they can't be factored into any way.\n\nOver the years prime numbers have only become more and more sought. The Primes are the basis of internet banking and all encryption that allows the internet to exist depends on it. They are the building blocks of numbers themselves.\n\nThis video covers what prime numbers are and how mathematicians throughout the globe have been instrumental in discovering a large variety of proofs about them, from the Fundamental Theorem of Arithmetic to Gauss' prime number theorem to touching on the Riemann Hypothesis.\n\nMore information on Euclid's proof: \n\nhttp://www.mathsisgoodforyou.com/conjecturestheorems/euclidsprimes.htm\n\nMusic: https://www.bensound.com/royalty-free-music \nBorrtex-Gravity (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by-nc/4.0/)",
