  "description": "Linda Brown was in the third grade when her father Oliver tried to enroll her in Sumner Elementary School in Topeka Kansas. Oliver and his daughter Linda were denied admission to the school that day. The year was 1950. Sumner was an all-white school. And Linda attended the school for black children across town. Separate but equal ruled the day in America. The moment Linda was turned away, it started a series of events that toppled the idea of separate but equal and led her all the way to the steps of the Supreme Court of the United States. Linda's father was the named plaintiff in the landmark case Brown v. Board of Education.\nThis week, we give education pioneer and civil rights icon Linda Brown, the final word.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/words-matter.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
