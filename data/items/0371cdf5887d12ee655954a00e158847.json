  "description": "Russia announced Thursday that it's expelling 60 U.S. diplomats, just a few days after the Trump administration expelled the same number of Russian diplomats from the U.S. That was in response to Russia's alleged poisoning of a former spy on British soil. Also this week, another big shake-up in the Trump administration: Veterans Affairs Secretary David Shulkin has been fired, and Trump says he plans to nominate his White House doctor, Ronny Jackson, to the post. And there is more upheaval on the president's legal team. This episode: host/political reporter Danielle Kurtzleben, White House correspondent Tamara Keith, congressional reporter Kelsey Snell and editor correspondent Ron Elving.
