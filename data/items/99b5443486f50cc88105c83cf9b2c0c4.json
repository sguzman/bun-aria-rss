Full disclosure: we told Showalter that we were going to talk to him about John Hughes movies, but we ended up inundating him with questions about his beloved comedy troupes The State and Stella as well as what we refer to as \"the Wet Hot American summer franchise.\" In that spirit, we also find time to share our summer camp experiences when we aren't poking fun of our hometown or learning more about Showalter's creative process. This episode also includes a lightning round of change.dork that sees our guest describing his perfect coffee blend in a detailed manner that we encourage you to recreate at home.&nbsp;</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
