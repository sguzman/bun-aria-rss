  "description": "Today we’re going to focus on play spaces and how to organize playrooms, and make those fun spaces, but we suggest you go back and listen to the “Designing the Perfect Kids Room” podcast from our show to get a nice warm up in organizing and trying to develop your kids’ space. We give some tips and ideas for organizing and making the best of your space when bedrooms are small and what you can do, such as cubbies or using a basement for toys and items that don’t need to be in the bedroom. You can help motivate your kids to clean up by explaining why it’s important to put the things in their places, or by telling them they can only have a certain amount of toys and to pick their favorites, and then give the remaining ones to kids who don’t have them. <br /><br />Setting up a good floor plan to keep things clean and organized 2:16<br />Maximizing the space with small bedrooms 9:00<br />Suggestions on how to motivate your kids to keep things organized 14:33<br />What every kid should have in their room 17:37<br />Playrooms: how to make the space look nice and still function as a playroom 20:48<br />A good place to set up a craft table and keep it tidy 22:31<br />What is a fun kids room we’ve made? 25:19<br /><br />“Even that first kid’s podcast, we talk about how kids have way better ideas than we do. Yes they sometimes need to be reigned in a little bit, but you get to choose. It’s kind of like with Halloween costumes. I love that Nolan picks out his Halloween costume because I get to remember what he was into at that moment and looking back at those pictures is so sweet, and it’s kind of the same thing with their rooms.” 18:43<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
