  "description": "<p>Born in a small town in upstate New York, pop-music phenom, Andy Grammer (<a href=\"http://andygrammer.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">http://andygrammer.com/</a>)earned his place in music the hard way. He spent years busking on the 3rd Street Promenade in Santa Monica, honing is voice and skills as a singer, songwriter and also learning what draws attention and makes people feel good.</p><p>He’s since become the first male pop star in a decade to reach the Top 10 at Adult Pop Radio with “Keep Your Head Up” and “Fine By Me,” from his 2011 self-titled debut. His second album, Magazines or Novels, featured the triple-platinum smash “Honey, I’m Good,” which was one of the best-selling songs of 2015, and the certified gold anthem “Good to be Alive (Hallelujah).”</p><p>Now, with mega-hits and a successful career, he’s thinking a lot about how to speak his own truth. The concept of honesty—what it means and how to attain it—offers both inspiration and challenge to one of the most successful pop artists to emerge in recent years.</p><p>You can see this reflected in his recent album, “The Good Parts,” which has racked up over 400 million total streams. He’s also launched a new podcast by the same name, where he sits down with people to explore the stories they often never share publicly.</p><p>In today’s conversation, we explore where Andy came from, how his parents and his faith have shaped him and how, now as a husband and father, he’s re-examining his life and work. We also dive into how he is paying fierce attention to crafting a career that allows him to be present and also feel fully-expressed and alive and, at the heart of it all, be of service to his audience.</p><p>-------------</p><p>Have you discovered your&nbsp;Sparketype&nbsp;yet?&nbsp;Take the Sparketype Assessment™ now.
