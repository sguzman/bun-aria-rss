We find out more about the sport of Aerial Skiing in Canada and why Deidra could've very nearly competed in another discipline in the sport at the Olympics. We also learn more about her amazing Olympic appearances, including the feelings of winning a medal at such a young age and the extraordinary story about her second Olympics which occurred only five months after breaking her neck. Added to this we find out more about her transition from competing into commentating and why she admires a certain legendary Aussie Aerial Skier so much. It's an amazing chat that you simply can't miss!</p>",
