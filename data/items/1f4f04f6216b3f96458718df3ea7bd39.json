  "description": "<p>Unimodular gravity can be formulated so that transverse diffeomorphisms and\nWeyl transformations are symmetries of the theory. For this formulation of\nunimodular gravity, we work out the two-point and three-point $h_{\\mu\\nu}$\ncontributions to the on-shell classical gravity action in the leading\napproximation and for an Euclidean AdS background. We conclude that these\ncontributions do not agree with those obtained by using General Relativity due\nto IR divergent contact terms. The subtraction of these IR divergent terms\nyields the same IR finite result for both unimodular gravity and General\nRelativity. Equivalence between unimodular gravity and General Relativity with\nregard to the gauge/gravity duality thus emerges in a non trivial way.\n</p>",
