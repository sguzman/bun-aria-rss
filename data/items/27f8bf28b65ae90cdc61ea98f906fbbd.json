  "description": "Amy Warner of ‘Sew Incredibly Crazy’ is a designer and quilting cheerleader! She is always sharing her fun projects and hosting sew alongs. We are going to talk about how to be part of sew along and how to set up a successful one if you are itching to try it!\n\nhttp://sewincrediblycrazy.blogspot.com/\n-----------------\nThe very first batting that I sought to ‘purchase again’ was Mountain Mist. I loved that the company has a rich history and that the batting was so nice to work with. When I started my business I contacted Mountain Mist and Linda Pumphrey and her staff were who I worked with. Linda is now with Mountain Mist again as the Senior Account Executive. She brings her experiences of working on the board of museums and with other companies back to Mountain Mist. She is also the author of the Mountain Mist Historical Quilt book. We are going to learn all about the quilt patterns that are a signature component of the company.\nhttps://fibrix.com/mountain-mist-batting/\n-------------\nI bought some of Tula Pink’s first fabric line was Full Moon Forest, the first with free spirit fabrics was Parisville and I bought that too… now 21 lines later is Tabby Road about to come out. What I found is that not only was her fabric interesting and detailed with images woven in, but there is also a story. For each Line Tula creates an entire universe of stories to bring all the prints into life. If you have a chance to hear her talk about how she creates, go! She is also an author and of course designs quilts to showcase her fabric. Tula’s on for the second half of the show so we have time to really chat!\nhttp://www.tulapink.com/\n================\nvisit American Patchwork & Quilting at http://allpeoplequilt.com\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/apqmagazine\nVisit host Pat Sloan at http://www.patsloan.com\nLearn more about your ad choices.
