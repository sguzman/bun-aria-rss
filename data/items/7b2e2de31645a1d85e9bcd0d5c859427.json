Supermarket aisles are now lined with gluten-free foods and restaurants are now catering to gluten-free diners. So how did gluten come to receive so much attention? Are people with celiac disease the only ones who should be on a gluten-free diet? And how do you know if gluten is making you sick?</p><br><p>In this episode, Dr. Hyman sits down with Maggie Ward to discuss why gluten sensitivity exists on a spectrum and how to determine if it is a threat to your health. They also share specific patient cases they have treated related to gluten sensitivity.</p><br><p>Maggie Ward, MS, RD, LDN, is the Nutrition Director at The UltraWellness Center. Maggie holds a master’s degree in Nutrition from Bastyr University which focuses on using whole foods for holistic Nutrition Therapy. In addition, she completed her requirements to become a registered dietitian at Westchester Medical Center in NY. Prior to joining The UltraWellness Center team in 2008, Maggie worked at The Brooklyn Hospital Center in New York providing nutrition counseling to children and families dealing with HIV. She also taught at the Jewish Community Center in Manhattan and other sites throughout New York City, teaching nutritionally focused cooking classes for children and adults. Much of her focus is on food allergies, digestive disorders, inflammatory conditions, Pediatrics and Sports Nutrition. Maggie has been counseling individuals, families, and business groups on therapeutic diets to address various health concerns for more than 15 years. Her ongoing clinical training through the Institute for Functional Medicine uses a systems biology approach when working with those who suffer from chronic and acute conditions to help them find their path to healing.
