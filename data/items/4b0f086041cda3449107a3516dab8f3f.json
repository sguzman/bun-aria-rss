We then dig into how this current moment of being forced into doing less can be used as a time to reevaluate our relationship to work, and how we can reconnect with the idea of doing things for their own sake, especially cultivating relationships with others.</p>\n<p>Get the show notes at <a href=\"aom.is/donothing\">aom.is/donothing</a>.</p>\n",
