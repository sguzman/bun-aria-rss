  "title": "PMS 2.0 095 - The Most Interesting Man On Earth: ESPN's Marty Smith",
  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys discuss his couple of days in Charlotte for the ESPN College Football seminar. He talks about getting thrown into the fire, and recounts his entire experience, as the college football season (and football in general) creeps closer and closer. Also joining the show is ESPN College Football storyteller/analyst, one of the most charismatic and genuine people on the face of the earth, and soon to be New York Times Bestselling Author, Marty Smith. He and Pat chat about his career path to where he's at now, the relationships he's made along the way, and a couple of stories from their few days together at the college football seminar. Marty also gives a sneak preview of his new book \"Never Settle: Sports, Family, &nbsp;and the American Soul,\" which details some incredible stories with the likes of Tim Tebow, Michael Vick, Ric Flair, Nick Saban, and his best friend, Eric Church, among many other things. You're really going to enjoy this interview (2:45-1:02:31). Pat and the guys also chat about LeBron taking heat for celebrating at his son's AAU game, the NFL season starting tonight with the Hall of Fame game, some of the stories that have been floating around training camp including Saints WR Michael Thomas signing a new deal, Lev Bell apologizing to fantasy owners for missing last season, and Nathan Peterman growing on Coach Gruden as well as the building excitement for the new season of Hard Knocks. Today's show is a great one. Come and laugh with us. Cheers.</p>\n",
