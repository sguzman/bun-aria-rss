Matthew details his life-changing quests sparked by having the same wet dream twice and how he puts himself in positions to receive divine, prophetic messages from the universe. He explains why his dad was proud of him for getting into a bar fight, why he cries during births and not deaths, and why his son creates Powerpoint presentations to illustrate why Matthew is wrong. Mayim and Matthew discuss parenthood, and Matthew opens up about the sense of immortality he felt at the birth of his first child.
