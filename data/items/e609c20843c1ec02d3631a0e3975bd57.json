  "title": "Linda Hogan — Song for the Turtles of the Gulf",
  "description": "<p>In a poem called a “Song,” Linda Hogan crafts a song for turtles and other creatures killed through oil spills in the gulf. At once a praise song for the beauty of the sea, the earth, and its animals, this song also functions as a lament: for the history erased by industrial practices; for the lack of respect and love for living breathing other-than-human lives; for plastic and the plastic containers used to hold the body of a dead sea turtle. The poem veers towards a prayer, too, begging forgiveness for being “thrown off true.”</p><p>Linda Hogan is a Chickasaw novelist, essayist, and environmentalist. She earned an undergraduate degree from the University of Colorado-Colorado Springs and an MA in English and creative writing from the University of Colorado-Boulder. Her books of poetry include <i>Dark. Sweet.</i>, <i>The Book of Medicines</i>, <i>Seeing Through the Sun</i>, and many more.</p><p>Find <a href=\"https://onbeing.org/programs/linda-hogan-song-for-the-turtles-of-the-gulf/#transcript\">the transcript</a> for this show at onbeing.org.</p>\n",
