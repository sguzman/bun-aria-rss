A quick google search for distillery architects will lead you to one place, Joseph, & Joseph + Bravura. This architecture firm is synonymous with creating the most iconic distillery and visitor center experiences across Kentucky. They got their start by designing Four Roses back in 1909 and have since then been the lead architects on places like Old Forester in downtown Louisville, Bardstown Bourbon Co, Michter's, LuxRow, Angel's Envy and so many more.
