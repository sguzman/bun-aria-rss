  "description": "<p>A robust and reliable system of detecting spam reviews is a crying need in\ntodays world in order to purchase products without being cheated from online\nsites. In many online sites, there are options for posting reviews, and thus\ncreating scopes for fake paid reviews or untruthful reviews. These concocted\nreviews can mislead the general public and put them in a perplexity whether to\nbelieve the review or not. Prominent machine learning techniques have been\nintroduced to solve the problem of spam review detection. The majority of\ncurrent research has concentrated on supervised learning methods, which require\nlabeled data - an inadequacy when it comes to online review. Our focus in this\narticle is to detect any deceptive text reviews. In order to achieve that we\nhave worked with both labeled and unlabeled data and proposed deep learning\nmethods for spam review detection which includes Multi-Layer Perceptron (MLP),\nConvolutional Neural Network (CNN) and a variant of Recurrent Neural Network\n(RNN) that is Long Short-Term Memory (LSTM). We have also applied some\ntraditional machine learning classifiers such as Nave Bayes (NB), K Nearest\nNeighbor (KNN) and Support Vector Machine (SVM) to detect spam reviews and\nfinally, we have shown the performance comparison for both traditional and deep\nlearning classifiers.\n</p>",
