  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys look at the free agency landscape for players now, and look how guys like Mookie Betts and Tom Brady are the perfect example for what athletes worth tens of millions and hundreds of millions of dollars are doing now when exploring their next moves. Pat and the guys also look at both Jason and Travis Kelce's Super Bowl parade speeches which were both incredible in their own regard and ultimately decide which one they think is better, and Pat looks ahead to this weekend's XFL slate and has a few more thoughts on the league as we are on the precipice of the rebranded leagues inaugural season and how it will be different than the first iteration of the XFL, and what changes will separate it from the NFL and what the NFL could potentially adopt from the XFL like the skycam. Also joining the show is 2x Pro Bowler, All-Pro, member of the Philadelphia Eagles Hall of Fame, former Running Back and friend of the program, Brian Westbrook stops by. Brian chats about Andy Reid's legacy and why he is so happy for him after winning his first Super Bowl title. They also discuss Dak potentially holding out if he gets franchise tagged by the Cowboys and whether or not that is the right idea, and Brian gives some insight as a guy who formerly held out going into the season. Brian also gives his thoughts on the potential new CBA and on the possibility of a 17 game season (20:58-34:14). Also joining the show is 3x Pro Bowler, All-Pro, Heisman Trophy winner, and former Quarterback for the Cincinnati Bengals, Oakland Raiders, and Arizona Cardinals, Carson Palmer stops by. Carson chats about what he thinks Jameis will do in his second season in a Bruce Arians led offense, and how Carson's interception numbers went way down in his 2nd season under Arians. Carson also gives his thoughts on Troy Polamalu being a 1st ballot Hall of Famer and what it was like playing against guys like him and Ed Reed and the differences in their styles of play. Carson also lets Pat know who the best guy he ever played with was, and who his favorite center he ever took snaps from was, he gives his thoughts on Larry Fitzgerald and how he has been the model of consistency for the last 15+ years (36:28-48:00). Today's show is a good one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
