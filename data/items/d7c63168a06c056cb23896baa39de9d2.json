  "description": "The months of September, October, November, and December take their names from Latin words meaning \"seven,\" \"eight,\" \"nine,\" and \"ten.\" So why don't their names correspond to where they fall in the year? The answer lies in an earlier version of the Roman calendar. The sweltering period called the \"dog days\" takes its name from the movements of a certain star. A new book offers an insider's view of the world of dictionary editing.\n Listen to all episodes for free: https://waywordradio.org/ Â Support the show to keep episodes coming: https://waywordradio.org/donate Â Your responses, questions, and comments are welcomed at any time!Â Â https://waywordradio.org/contact Â words@waywordradio.org Â Listener line 1 (877) 929-9673 toll-free in the US and Canada Â Text/SMS +1 (619) 567-9673 Â Copyright Wayword, Inc., a 501(c)(3) corporation.
