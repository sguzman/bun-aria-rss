How many have you tried that left you frustrated and pissed off? Probably too many to count or recall. We’re bombarded with misinformation about fitness, exercise, and diet at nauseum. It’s not getting you or anyone closer to the results you really desire, and it almost makes the results you want a bit unclear and confusing.<br /><br />Sal DiStefano is no newcomer to the fitness scene. By the age of 19 he was already general manager at a local gym. Unfortunately for him, but lucky for you and all of his clients since, he had a health scare of his own from an autoimmune disorder which resulted in him losing 15 pounds of muscle! Sal refocused and started learning more about gut health, hormone health and how to prioritize health over appearance.<br /><br />His book, The Resistance Training Revolution, breaks down fitness misconceptions that social media and bad diet fads are flooding you with. In this episode, break through the idea of relying on cardio to burn those extra calories and start realizing the amazing benefits strength training offers your body. Stop training just to lose weight fast and look good, and make the mindset shift to start approaching diet and exercise for the right reasons, so it becomes lifelong and sustainable.<br /><br />Check out Sal DiStefano’s book, The Resistance Training Revolution: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3OvyaJC\" rel=\"noopener\">https://amzn.to/3OvyaJC</a> <br /><br />SHOW NOTES:<br /><br />0:00 | Introduction to Sal DiStefano<br />0:43 | How to Burn Belly Fat<br />6:36 | Train Your Body to Burn More Calories<br />13:06 | Benefits of Strength Training<br />21:54 | The Problem with Running<br />28:48 | Find the Right Exercise for Your<br />43:24 | Watch Your Hormones<br />52:33 | How to Eat Intuitively<br /><br />QUOTES:<br /><br />“The average person has been told to value exercise, mainly by its calorie burn, and that's so wrong because the amount of calories you burn while you exercise is actually the least important thing.” [3:54] <br /><br />“Strength training is the most consistent way to raise testosterone, [...] in men” [14:30]<br /><br />“Strength training has been shown to be one of the most effective ways to stop or halt the progression of the beta amyloid plaques that are so associated with Alzheimer's” [15:31]<br /><br />“Because we can't just pop the exercise pill, people leave the most obvious solution on the table.” [17:09] <br /><br />“When it comes to improving all health metrics, mental, psychological, and physical, as you follow along, as you continue the process, it gets better and better.
