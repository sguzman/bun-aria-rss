  "description": "Over the weekend, I attended my daughter’s gymnastic competition... and found out (once again) why the saying “happy wife, happy life” is accurate. [0:30] It’s a huge week here at Curzio Research. Yesterday, our  security began trading on the tZERO ATS (Advanced Trading System). I share why investors should dig into the security token space… and how it’s disrupting Wall Street’s old ways of raising capital. [4:30] The opportunity in security tokens reminds me of several other revolutionary trends—from fracking to the Internet of Things (IoT)... And it benefits both issuers and investors. [7:35] Moving on, the Fed’s coming rate hikes aren’t priced into the markets. I highlight why the Fed won’t be able to control inflation… [17:35] But as inflation moves higher, one left-for-dead sector is booming: traditional energy. I break down why the push to green energy is backfiring… and how to gain exposure to this space. [20:50] The volatility we’re seeing right now is no joke… Some of the biggest stocks, from Meta (FB) to Amazon (AMZN), are moving 20% in a day—and moves like these are likely our “new normal.” [25:50] So, as we all adjust, I want to thank you, my listeners. We try very hard to help individual investors here at Curzio Research, and I genuinely appreciate all your support and feedback. [31:30]",
