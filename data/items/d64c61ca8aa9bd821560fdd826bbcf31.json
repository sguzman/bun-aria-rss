  "description": "<p>In the study of some dynamical systems the limsup set of a sequence of\nmeasurable sets is often of interest. The shrinking targets and recurrence are\ntwo of the most commonly studied problems that concern limsup sets. However,\nthe zero-one laws for the shrinking targets and recurrence are usually treated\nseparately and proved differently. In this paper, we introduce a generalized\ndefinition that can specialize into the shrinking targets and recurrence; our\napproach gives a unified proof of the zero-one laws for the two problems.\n</p>",
