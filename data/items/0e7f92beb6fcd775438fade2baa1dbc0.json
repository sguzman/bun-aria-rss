  "description": "<p>Neural decoding is still a challenge and hot topic in neurocomputing science.\nRecently, many studies have shown that brain network pattern containing rich\nspatial and temporal structure information, which represented the activation\ninformation of brain under external stimuli. The traditional method is to\nextract brain network features directly from the common machine learning\nmethod, then put these features into the classifier, and realize to decode\nexternal stimuli. However, this method cannot effectively extract the\nmulti-dimensional structural information, which is hidden in the brain network.\nThe tensor researchers show that the tensor decomposition model can fully mine\nunique spatio-temporal structure characteristics in multi-dimensional structure\ndata. This research proposed a stimulus constrain tensor brain model(STN),\nwhich involved the tensor decomposition idea and stimulus category constraint\ninformation. The model was verified on the real neuroimaging data sets (MEG and\nfMRI). The experimental results show that the STN model achieved more 11.06%\nand 18.46% compared with others methods on two modal data sets. These results\nimply the superiority of extracting discriminative characteristics about STN\nmodel, especially for decoding object stimuli with semantic information.\n</p>",
