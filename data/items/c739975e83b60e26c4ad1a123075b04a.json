  "description": "<p>Bryan Callen is one of the best guests always on Rogan. One of Joe's best friends for over 25 years. I'm really happy he's back on so soon and doing more podcasts just with him and Joe. Always a good time. Check out his comedy. He's so funny.</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Enjoy my review folks!</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Please email me with any suggestions and questions for future shows :</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com</p>\n",
