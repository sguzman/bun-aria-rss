  "description": "<p>Sign up to Patreon to get access to bonus ad-free podcasts, exclusive downloads, live Q&As and more: https://www.patreon.com/drcarolineleaf</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>EPISODE DESCRIPTION: In this podcast and blog, I talk about how to get out of a shame spiral. In our society today, it can be hard to feel any degree of self-worth. We are bombarded with the shame of not living up to our own expectations, or the expectations of others. We cannot live up to the photoshopped and retouched images that seem to tell us that to be happy, we must look, dress or act in a certain way, or get straight As and go to an Ivy League university. We are not able to compete with celebrities and influencers—we are just one social media ‘like’ in a sea of admirers, wishing to be someone or do something.</p>\n<p>Read the show blog here:&nbsp;https://drleaf.com/blogs/news/how-to-find-freedom-from-the-shame-spiral</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>OFFERS FROM OUR SPONSORS:</p>\n<p>-<strong>BetterHelp: Get 10% off their first month at&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"http://betterhelp.com/drleaf\"><strong>betterhelp.com/drleaf</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>-InsideTracker: For a limited time, get 20% off the entire InsideTracker store.&nbsp;Just go to&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://info.insidetracker.com/drleaf\"><strong>insidetracker.com/drleaf</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p>\n<p><strong>-NOOM: Sign up for your trial at&nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.noom.com/programs/health-weight/exsf01/?upv=3&sp=adresults&utm_source=cleaningupthementalmess&utm_medium=podcast&utm_content=drleaf&type=bakedin&group=audio&step=pros&lang=en&isvanity=y#/\"><strong>noom.com/DRLEAF</strong></a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>EPISODE HIGHLIGHTS:</p>\n<p><strong>1:25 </strong>How low self-esteem & shame are connected</p>\n<p><strong>1:40</strong> What shame is</p>\n<p><strong>2:15</strong> The difference between shame & guilt</p>\n<p><strong>3:30, 9:05</strong> The shame spiral</p>\n<p><strong>6:20</strong> Shame & the mind-brain connection</p>\n<p><strong>9:30</strong> How easy it is to feel shame</p>\n<p><strong>12:25, 18:27, 28:00</strong> How to exit the shame spiral</p>\n<p><strong>24:15</strong> Don’t let negative thoughts just wander through your mind!</p>\n<p><strong>26:00</strong> How to “edit” you shame thoughts</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>ADDITIONAL RESOURCES:</p>\n<p>-Get my new book Cleaning up Your Mental Mess here: https://www.cleaningupyourmentalmess.com</p>\n<p>-Download my new and improved brain detox app here: https://neurocycle.app</p>\n<p>-Get a free Cleaning up Your Mental Mess workbook when you subscribe to my weekly email at drleaf.com!</p>\n<p>-Sign up to join my free text program and receive mental health care tips.
