    "media:description": "How do you find the length of a vector?  And how do you change that length?  We'll answer that in this video, and we will see that finding the length of a vector is like finding the absolute value, and that scaling a vector is like multiplication.\n\nThis video is a part of \"From Zero to Geo\", a series where we formulate geometric algebra, an incredibly powerful branch of mathematics, from the ground up.
