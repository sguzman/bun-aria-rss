  "description": "<p>When 99% of American companies are small businesses, it’s no exaggeration to say that these businesses are the backbone of our country. These startups have been responsible for almost all new job creation over the past 3 decades! And not only are small businesses important to our economy but they’re important to us on a personal level as well. These are the storefronts and people who make up our communities and neighborhoods- they’re a part of our identity! However as technology marches on, small businesses also need to adapt and utilize this innovation to continue to reach their customers where and how they want to be reached. We’re going to cover some of our favorite ways that small businesses are able to use technology to stand out in really cool ways and contribute to their local community.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Double Purple Chroma by Other Half Brewing. Since we recorded this episode live in NYC, we were excited to enjoy a local craft beer from the borough of Brooklyn.
