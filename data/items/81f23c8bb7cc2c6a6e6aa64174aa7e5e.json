  "description": "<p><p>Round 1: The chief negotiator for the Taliban reported that a “deal is done” involving the closure of 5 US bases in Afghanistan. Is the war over? Did we win? Well, it's hard to say. </p><p>Round 2: A historic class graduated from Ranger school last week. It included the first ever Air Force woman to complete the course and former NBA player Marshall Plumlee who is 7 feet tall and you can't teach that. </p><p>Round 3: I sat down with former Army infantry officer and Captain Will Bardenwerper and talked about his journey from Princeton to Wall Street to Iraq and everywhere in between. </p><p>Round 4: We are going to be working our way through the greatest book I've ever read. The book is called The Enlistment. It's a self-published, completely unedited-masterpiece that I cannot wait to reveal to the world!</p><p> </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
