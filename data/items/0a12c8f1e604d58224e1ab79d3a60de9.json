Today, we break free from the chains of conditioned thinking, sharpen our mental awareness, and learn how to utilize our emotions as a strength, rather than a weakness. On this episode of Conversations with Tom, Tom Bilyeu is joined by New York Times and international bestselling author Robert Greene to discuss such matters and more as they explore why today, more than ever, we need to be sharply aware of the political and cultural environments that seek to condition our minds and force us to think irrationally. They discuss why so many behave irrationally today, the power of analyzing your emotions, how today’s environment has conditioned our minds, how we can utilize awareness to empower us, how to use anger as a motivator, the dangers of today’s culture, the constant need for change, the difference between yesterday’s and today’s generations, the story of Athena, why life must have both pain and pleasure, and much more.
