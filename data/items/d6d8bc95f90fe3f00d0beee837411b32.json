  "description": "The world’s leaders are getting together in the UK at the end of this month to discuss how to tackle climate change. Meanwhile, fuel prices are rising higher and higher, and increasing talk of inflation. Prices are rising because, quite simply, demand is rising but supply is still constrained. Gas supplies in Europe are dependent on Russia and renewable energy has been held back by low winds and other weather-related influences. Now, to meet demand, countries are stepping up their use of fossil fuels. Energy supplies “at any costs” has been the approach in China. Phil Dobbie asks Steve Keen whether we’ll ever reach renewable targets whilst the energy industry is in private hands. In the UK how much of the problem we now face is the result of Thatcher-era philosophies that believed competition would yield greater amounts of lower priced energy?<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
