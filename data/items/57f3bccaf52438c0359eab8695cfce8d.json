In fact, Daybell died just two weeks before Lori Vallow and Chad Daybell wed, and just a month before the Vallow children disappeared. No autopsy was performed at the time of her death since comments made by Chad Daybell lead authorities to rule her death as natural causes, and the family did not want an autopsy done.</p><p>Joining Nancy Grace today:</p><ul>\n<li>Julie Rowe - Friend of Tammy Daybell, Author, Podcaster: \"The Julie Rowe Show\", julieroweprepare.com,</li>\n<li>Ashley Wilcott - Judge and Trial Attorney, Anchor at Court TV,  <a href=\"http://www.ashleywillcott.com/\">www.ashleywillcott.com</a>, Twitter: @WillcottAshley </li>\n<li>Dr. Angela Arnold - Psychiatrist, Atlanta, GA www.angelaarnoldmd.com </li>\n<li>Joe Scott Morgan - Professor of Forensics Jacksonville State University, Author, \"Blood Beneath My Feet\" featured on \"Poisonous Liaisons\" on True Crime Network</li>\n<li>Eric Grossarth - Reporter, East Idaho News dot com, Instagram/Twitter: @EricGrossarth</li>\n</ul><p><br></p>\n      <p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
