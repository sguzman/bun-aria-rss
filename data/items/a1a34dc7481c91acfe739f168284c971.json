  "description": "The Berlin Airlift. The Korean War. The Cuban Missile Crisis. The Space Race. Vietnam. Detente. Reagan. Solidarity. Gorbachev. The tales of these earth-shaking milestones have been always been told as a series of individual events, completely apart from each other. But they were not individual events; they were individual threads in the tapestry of the Apocalypse That Didn’t Happen. And because they were all part of the same ongoing story, they need to be treated that way.
