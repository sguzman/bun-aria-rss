  "description": "Adam and Dr. Drew open the show discussing the bygone age of cigarette companies advertising in confusing places such as athletic competitions, specifically citing the Benson & Hedges Classic from the 1970s. Later they turn to the phones and speak with a caller who is looking to identify the difference between one who is 'sober' as opposed to someone who simply hasn't been drinking for an extended period of time. Drew also explains some of the weird feelings and self worth issues that he has been struggling with. Later they turn to the phones and speak to a caller with a response to a previous caller who had strong thoughts on former President Trump.\n\nPlease Support Our Sponsors:\nSimpliSafe.com/Adam2\nTenThousand.CC, code ADS\nThe Jordan Harbinger Show\nGeico.com\nPluto.TV",
