  "description": "In this episode of Dear Alice we are talking about hallways. Especially in this age of open floor plans, it sometimes feels like the journey of walking through a house can be lost. The hallway is an opportunity to have a smaller, more intimate moment and doesn't have to be a means to an end. We talk about how to make hallways more exciting with flooring choices and transitions, lighting and artwork. All of this can help your hallway become a place where you can stay a little longer.<br /><br />How to Spruce up hallways 2:00<br />Decorating Walls 8:50<br />How to Light a Hallway 11:16<br />Using Closets in non Closet Way 15:36<br />Vestibule 20:39<br /><br />“So to collect all of your groupings of family photos, a really great place to do that is in a hallway. And the reason why is because it’s an intimate space; you’re up close. So you can actually see the details.”  8:47<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a>",
