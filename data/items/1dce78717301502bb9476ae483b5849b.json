  "description": "<p>The Therapy for Black Girls Podcast is a weekly conversation with Dr. Joy Harden Bradford, a licensed Psychologist in Atlanta, Georgia, about all things mental health, personal development, and all the small decisions we can make to become the best possible versions of ourselves.</p><p>The true crime genre is one of the fastest growing, but it is incredibly telling who’s stories are told. This has become yet another space where the stories of Black women who are victims are largely ignored, particularly those of darker skinned Black women. This erasure perpetuates the myth that Black women are not targets of serial violence, leaving cases unsolved and communities shattered. To share about the important work she’s done to shed light on Black women victims of serial violence, today we’re joined by Dr. Terrion Williamson. Dr. Williamson and I chatted about how she began to research in this area, why Black women, particularly sex workers, are often targets for serial murder, the inequalities with which Black women victims are covered in the media, and the impact that these crimes have on communities.</p><p><strong>Resources</strong></p><p>Visit our <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/shop/therapy4bgirls\">Amazon Store</a> for all the books mentioned on the podcast!</p><p><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/podcasts/959614430/through-the-cracks\">Through the Cracks podcast</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Where to Find Dr. Williamson</strong></p><p><a href=\"https://www.theblackmidwest.com/\">https://www.theblackmidwest.com/</a></p><p><br></p><p><strong>Stay Connected</strong></p><p>Is there a topic you'd like covered on the podcast?
