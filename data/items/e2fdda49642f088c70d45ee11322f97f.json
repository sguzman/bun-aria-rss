  "description": "The mysticism and intrigue of the Bermuda Triangle has just turned personal for Admiral David Segarra: his former ship, the USS Wasp, has gone missing in the area without a trace. \n\nBut this is only one of a few strange occurrences in the area: storms, disappearances, and other phenomena have convinced Admiral Segarra that the only way to learn the truth is to investigate it for himself. After getting shipwrecked on a nearby island not visible on any of their maps, his team begins to explore— only to discover they are not alone. As the secrets of the island reveal themselves, finding a way home becomes a matter of life or death. \n\nAdrenaline: The Triangle is a Realm production, created by Dan Kobolt and written by Dan Kobolt, Mindy McGinnis, and Sylvia Spruck Wrigley.\nFor more shows like this, visit Realm.fm.
