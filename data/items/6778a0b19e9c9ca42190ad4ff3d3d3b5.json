  "description": "I wanted to name this episode \"it's not easy being green,\" but it really is. The Green Knight had his head chopped off last episode...but still carried it out of the most uncomfortable Christmas dinner ever. Really, it's not easy being Gawain, who has to go present his neck in payment. Except it really is easy being Gawain. Most of this episode will consist of him sleeping until noon in a fancy castle. But he still has that date with destiny on New Year's Day...and by \"destiny\" I mean a hairy green gentleman who is really good at pole vaulting. If you disrespect the hobbies of the creatures this week, they will make your life mildly uncomfortable for like an evening. You've been warned.
