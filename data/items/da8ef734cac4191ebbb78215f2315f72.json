This is the podcast where we ask some of the leading social scientists - and other experts - to answer intelligent questions about economics, politics or society. In this episode Sue Windebank asks whether predictions about robots automating us out of our jobs are true and how technology is going to change the way we work. Tackling the question, ‘What’s the future of work’, are: Professor David Graeber of LSE’s Department of Anthropology; Dr Aleks Krotoski,  social psychologist, technology journalist and former visiting fellow in LSE’s Media and Communications Department ; Dr Guy Michaels, LSE Associate Professor of Economics; and Leslie Willcocks , Professor of Technology, Work and Globalisation at LSE.
