Find out in this episode as I interview Scott Milford, author of the Behavior and Motivation website.  If you're about how to apply Psychology to everyday life then this is the guy to show you how he does it.  In this episode we talk about how to get kids to practice the piano, but you'll quickly see how this approach could be applied to all kinds of other life challenges.  Scott developed his approach over many years of working with young people both at the piano and with at-risk adolescents in school.  See how Psychology can be put to work! </p>",
