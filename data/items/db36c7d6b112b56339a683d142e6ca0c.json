  "description": "<p>Turbulent Radiative Mixing Layers (TRMLs) form at the interface of cold,\ndense gas and hot, diffuse gas in motion with each other. TRMLs are ubiquitous\nin and around galaxies on a variety of scales, including galactic winds and the\ncircumgalactic medium. They host the intermediate temperature gases that are\nefficient in radiative cooling, thus play a crucial role in controlling the\ncold gas supply, phase structure, and spectral features of galaxies. In this\nwork, we introduce a simple parameterization of the effective turbulent\nconductivity and viscosity that enables us to develop a simple and intuitive\nanalytic 1.5 dimensional model for TRMLs. Our analytic model reproduces the\nmass flux, total cooling, and phase structure of 3D simulations of TRMLs at a\nfraction of the computational cost. It also reveals essential insights into the\nphysics of TRMLs, particularly the importance of the viscous dissipation of\nrelative kinetic energy in balancing radiative cooling. This dissipation takes\nplace both in the intermediate temperature phase, which offsets the enthalpy\nflux from the hot phase, and in the cold phase, which enhances radiative\ncooling. Additionally, our model provides a fast and easy way of computing the\ncolumn density and surface brightness of TRMLs, which can be directly linked to\nobservations.\n</p>",
