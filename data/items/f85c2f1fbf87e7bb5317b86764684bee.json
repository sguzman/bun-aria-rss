  "description": "It's DFS episode time! Heath is joined by SportsLine's Mike McClure to break down the DFS slate for Week 16. We start by discussing what to do with Josh Jacobs' absence: is there more value in DeAndre Washington or Jalen Richard (1:50)? Next, we take a deep dive into the Vegas totals, with SEA and BAL leading the charge and DET and NYJ looking like offenses to fade (3:41). Then we go position-by-position identifying the best cash game and tournament plays, with QB (8:40), RB (14:00), WR (19:05), and TE (23:25). LET'S GET WEIRD with one off the wall play per position (27:45). We finish off with our picks for the Saturday slate (33:33), including our favorite stacks and Heath's optimal lineup.\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
