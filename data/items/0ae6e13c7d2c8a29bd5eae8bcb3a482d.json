  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, California will decide if they retain their liberty by electing a new governor or vote for tyranny and keeping Gov Gavin Newsom in office. Larry Elder is a vote to save the state and reject all of the radical changes enacted in California that shut churches, closed businesses, and eliminated many basic rights. Then, spineless leadership by Secretary of State Antony Blinken and the comments of George W. Bush comparing those that attacked America on September 11th with rioters trespassing in the Capitol Building on January 6th are an absolute Disgrace. Judge Mehta is now the second federal judge questioning the constitutionality of felony charges that the government has brought against members of groups such as the Oath Keepers, the Three Percenters, and the Proud Boys. Later, the media is working with the government to destroy our liberty. Bob Woodward's new book trashes Donald Trump again, but it also reveals that Gen. Mark Milley tried to lead a coup by warning the Chinese of any military strikes by the U.S. Milley held secret phone calls with Chinese military Gen. Li behind the back of then-President Trump. If the book is accurate Milley should be thrown out of the military and court-martialed. Why would the media only report on this now? Why is it okay for these so-called journalists to hold back information until they can cash in on a book? Why does the public accept these pseudo-events as news? Those who don't follow the edicts of the propagandistic press shall perish by it. Afterward, Arizona Attorney General Mark Brnovich is the first AG to file a lawsuit against the Biden Administrations' unconstitutional vaccine mandate because it violates the 10th Amendment and the principles of federalism. Perhaps more ironically is the administration's stance on allowing migrants to enter the country illegally and imposing a vaccine mandate on certain citizens based on where they work which is a violation of the equal protection clause of the Constitution. Brnovich added that while states may have police powers, the federal government does not. Finally, Sen. Ron Johnson calls the show and shares that President Trump was treated less fairly than any other president, ever. Johnson added that we must recognize that Democrats own the media and they launched an internal coup against their political adversaries.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
