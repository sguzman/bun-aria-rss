  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, Police and first responders are on the scene of a building implosion in South Florida. They ran into the building not knowing if more will collapse. This is why you don’t defund any first responders. Passersby are rescuing children from the rubble because that's what red-blooded Americans do. Another act of heroism involved a young man in Chicago taking a bullet for a young lady, not that it matters but none of these individuals were White. Then, an article in the Daily Caller made way for multiple hit pieces by Media Matters including two misrepresenting a statement made on this program. Comments that merely explained the 3/5 compromise of the United States Constitution were falsely made to look like a defense of the reprehensible. Later, Bernie Sanders and Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez’s Green New Deal is a war on capitalism. The country doesn't need a conservative climate caucus, perhaps they should launch a free market caucus. The war on capitalism predates critical race theory and all of the schemes which exist to destroy the free market. Afterward, Rudy Giuliani is being targeted by judges in New York and they have temporarily suspended his law license. This action eliminates any protections that former President Trump had including representation, attorney-client privilege, and their work product. Judges seem to be selective about where they decide to enforce laws. Interestingly Democrat attorneys like Stacey Abrams and Benjamin Crump have not been suspended. Finally, former Ambassador David Friedman joins the show to discuss his upcoming book and the focal point of violent extremism in the middle east, and how the Abraham Accords alleviated that threat. \n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
