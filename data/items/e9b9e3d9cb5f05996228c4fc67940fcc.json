  "description": "The Constitutional rot of the past four years has set the stage for the corruption of our institutions and, equally importantly, for growing delegitimization of our government. This plays into the hands of a president who is ever more desperate to cling to power lest he lose his fortune and his freedom. This in turn has experts who are studying the preparations for the November 3 election to express deep concern that we may be heading into a period of profound crisis for our system, one that, should Trump prevail in undermining the will of the people could mean the collapse of our system and a the onset of a period of national chaos. This is not abstract. Critical, dangerous steps confirming this is the direction we are headed are already taking place. We discuss with Pulitzer Prize-winning journalist Barton Gellman, Rosa Brooks of the Georgetown Law Center and Ed Luce of the Financial Times. It is essential listening.Each week, we’re bringing you a new episode of one of our favorite podcasts, Deep State Radio.
