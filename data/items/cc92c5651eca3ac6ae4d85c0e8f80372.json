  "description": "Miss Kay takes the practice of hospitality to a whole new level. Phil and Jase are glad we're no longer bound by the old food laws, especially when shrimp is on the menu. The guys tackle the great fallacy of cancel culture, how cancel culture is really the opposite of what God does, and how we can stop providing this ungodly phenomenon the fuel it needs. They also discuss God and favoritism, the difference between being baptized by the Holy Spirit and being baptized in water, and the greatest weapon the world has ever known.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
