We’ll say, “He or she just isn’t doing it for me anymore.” But what if it’s your responsibility to make sure that you’re keeping the passion alive? If you are truly living your fullest life, you will create desire. Take ownership. That’s why, for this week’s Five Minute Friday, I want to share this conversation I had with world-renowned relationship expert Esther Perel who knows the key to making monogamous relationships successful.
