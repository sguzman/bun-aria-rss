  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, President Biden has abused and bastardized immigration laws that allow for migrants to apply for refugee status for simply facing poverty or crime. Yet, Cubans fleeing the tyranny of communism have been told to not even attempt swimming to the US to seek refuge. Then, the American Marxists are silent or supportive of what's going on. What stands between the people and tyranny is the civil society. Biden has invited the most corrupt racist organization in the world, the United Nations, to investigate race relations in the United States. Parents must borrow a page from the left's BDS movement and apply it to their children's school to direct and guide what and how they learn. Keep in mind that the founders of critical race theory came from Ivy League colleges. Later, Democrat legislators in Texas fled to DC to meet up with DC Democrat leaders. The reason is for their exodus and abdication of duty was an unwillingness to vote on a bill that would strengthen the integrity of elections by increasing poll watchers and checking voter ID. The group then held a press conference on Capitol Hill and broke out into song singing the old civil rights hymn \"We Shall Overcome.\" Afterward, Senate candidate, Josh Mandel, calls in to discuss his campaign for the US Senate in Ohio.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
