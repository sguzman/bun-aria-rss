  "description": "<p>On October 17, 1974, 12 year old Jan Broberg was kidnapped by her next door neighbor and parents’ best friend—a man they all loving called “B.” B, unbeknownst to them, was a pedophile who had become obsessed with Jan and would stop at nothing to have her. This story is so full of of jaw-dropping twists, you really do have to hear it to believe it.  OOH! It's important to note that Jan today is alive and well (and looking like a million bucks). She is one of the major story tellers here, and goddamn is she a force to be reckoned with.</p>\n",
