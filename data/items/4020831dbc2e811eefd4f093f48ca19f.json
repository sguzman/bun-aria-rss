We'll give you a clue: Gotta catch ‘em all, eh?</p><p>Round 2: Navy veteran turned distance running hardo is set to circumnavigate the globe on foot this year. He's doing it for suicide prevent but theres not chance that he and I would be friends. It makes me wanna puke. </p><p>Round 3: Story of the break was that Marines needed to be sent in to secure the Embassy in Iraq after protestors lead violent action trying to overtake the Embassy. The fallout was quick but most likely isnt close to over. </p><p>Round 4: I hate to give North Korea any credit but alas, we must. We have promised the listener that we will always be honest.
