  "description": "Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged! I just got back from the 2017 Consumer Electronic Show... and we have a lot of ground to cover. To start off today's episode, I give listeners my take on the event. This year's experience was a bit different. In fact, there are more trends to avoid rather than trends to invest in. Tune in this week as I'll be separating the truth from all the noise. I'm then joined by the one and only, Marin Katusa - founder of Katusa Research. There's been a lot of tech-talk recently, but let's not get caught up in just one sector. With the annual Vancouver Resource Investment Conference just two weeks away, Marin is here to give listeners a sneak-peek. Also, he catches us up to date within the gold, silver, and uranium markets. Even with the dollar strengthening, we've seen a slight rebound in these sectors. What does this mean going forward? Well, let us hear from the best as Marin shares his 2017 outlook. Then, to end the episode, Marin talks about his most successful discovery last year. He claims it as the \"world's largest undeveloped copper & gold mine.\" Its the stuff of legends... And thanks to Marin, I gave listeners a stock that has grown over 300% since recommending it - just 6 months ago! As you'll hear, this stock is dirt-cheap yet still holds massive growth potential.",
