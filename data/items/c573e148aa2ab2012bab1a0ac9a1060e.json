  "description": "Frank is traveling this week, so I (Daniel Creech) am behind the mic to cover the markets and rising energy prices…  Jamie Dimon, CEO of JPMorgan Chase, is warning investors to “brace yourself” for an economic hurricane. I give my thoughts on his prediction. I also explain why President Biden's Wall Street Journal op-ed shows how government policies will lead to even higher oil prices… and the European Union’s latest Russian sanctions will only hurt local economies.  Bottom line, if you think you’ve missed the gains in energy stocks, think again…  In this episode:  Jamie Dimon warns of economic hurricane [1:10] High rates and inflation are the new market normal [4:15] President Biden's op-ed missed the mark on energy prices [7:25]  Why the new EU sanctions on Russian are a bad idea [11:55]  You haven’t missed the opportunity in oil stocks [14:45]   Enjoyed this episode?
