Along the way, we find out what goes on at a butterfly garden, whether you can be a firefighter, if you are tiny, injured & diseased, and just how exactly ripped pieces of duct tape can be pieced together!! </p><p>Hosted by James Pietragallo & Jimmie Whisman </p><p><br></p><p>New episodes every Thursday!!</p><p>Please subscribe, rate, and review!</p><p>Listen on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, or wherever you listen to podcasts!</p><p>Head to<a href=\"http://shutupandgivememurder.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> shutupandgivememurder.com</a> for all things Small Town Murder!</p><p>For merchandise:<a href=\"http://crimeinsports.threadless.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> crimeinsports.threadless.com</a></p><p>Check out James and Jimmie's other show: Crime in Sports</p><p> </p><p>Follow us on social media!</p><p>Facebook:<a href=\"http://facebook.com/smalltownpod\" target=\"_blank\"> facebook.com/smalltownpod</a></p><p>Instagram:<a href=\"http://instagram.com/smalltownmurder\" target=\"_blank\"> instagram.com/smalltownmurder</a></p><p>Twitter:<a href=\"http://twitter.com/MurderSmall\" target=\"_blank\"> twitter.com/MurderSmall</a></p><p> </p><p>Contact the show: crimeinsports@gmail.com</p><p><br></p>\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
