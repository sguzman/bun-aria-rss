We discuss the flippening of Ether & Bitcoin, and the opportunity for it in this cycle. Su & Kyle make it clear that institutions are coming around on Ethereum, and the scope of the ecosystem is such that any EVM-compatible (composable with the Ethereum Virtual Machine) is in turn bullish for ETH.</p> <p>Ethereum has painted six weekly green candles in a row and is indisputably red-hot at the time of this recording. Despite the bullish narrative, it remains difficult to properly measure the magnitude of this move.
