  "description": "It’s Homecoming Sunday at Transformation Church! After over 900 days, we have finally opened our doors again! We were so excited to see our TC family, and Pastor Mike brought a powerful word. He taught us what home is supposed to look like through God’s eyes, and what happens when we run away from it. When we get far from home, we get far away from the Father. But no matter how far we are, God always welcomes us back with open arms. It’s time to come home!<br /><br />#Homecoming #TCIsBack #TCHomecoming #REpresent<br /><br />Join us for service online every Sunday at 11am (CST) and on Monday’s for Monday Night Prayer at 6pm (CST). <br /><br />If you received Christ through this message, text SAVED to 828282.<br /><br />We would love to hear how God is touching your life through this ministry!
