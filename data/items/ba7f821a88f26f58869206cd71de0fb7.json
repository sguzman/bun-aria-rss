  "description": "<p>Today, ‘sibling’ is one of the most basic kinship terms. However, it wasn't introduced into English until 1903 by a pair of scientists working on genetics. More accurately, ‘sibling’ was <em>re</em>introduced into the language after 1,000 years of dormancy. In this episode, we look at ‘sibling’ in its Old English context and explore its Indo-European roots. Furthermore, we look into the etymology of ‘brother’ and ‘sister.’ </p> <p>For your free 1-month trial of The Great Courses Plus, click <a href=\"http://www.thegreatcoursesplus.com/words\">here</a>.</p>",
