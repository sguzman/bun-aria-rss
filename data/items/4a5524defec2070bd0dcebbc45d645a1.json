At present, she is a psychiatry resident at the Icahn School of Medicine at Mount Sinai. Jordyn is deeply involved in research, curriculum development, and advocacy work pertaining to clinician well-being, locally, nationally, and globally. Together, we wrote <i>Choose Growth: A Workbook for Transcending Trauma, Fear, and Self-Doubt.</i></p><p>In this episode, I talk to Jordyn Feingold about positive medicine and the importance of choosing growth. As a physician and positive psychology practitioner, Jordyn is on a mission to shift the focus of medicine from treatment to well-being. As much as our physical health can influence our mental health, the reverse is also true. She talks about the impact and practical applications of positive psychology in healthcare. We also touch on the topics of resilience, relationships, communication, growth, and transcendence.</p><p>Website: <a href=\"http://positivepsychologyforphysicians.com/\">positivepsychologyforphysicians.com</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/jordynfeingold\">@jordynfeingold</a></p><p> </p><p><strong>Topics</strong><br /> </p><p>04:52 Positive Medicine</p><p>12:08 Embodied cognition</p><p>14:06 The REVAMP model of well-being</p><p>18:10 Positive interventions</p><p>21:39 Choose Growth</p><p>28:28 Who’s in your boat?</p><p>32:08 Active vs passive constructive responding</p><p>35:53 High-quality connections </p><p>40:01 Jordyn as chief extrovert</p><p>42:41 “Yes, and” transcendence</p><p>48:34 Integrate your dark side</p>\n",
