  "title": "Ep. 739 - The Left Searches For A 'Cure' For Whiteness",
  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, we will discuss the problem of whiteness. I don’t think whiteness is a problem, but we are told that it is. In fact, as a recent paper in a psychoanalytic journal argues, it is really a disease which must be “cured.” Also five headlines including the cop who flipped a pregnant woman’s car on the highway because she didn’t pull over fast enough during a traffic stop. Is that proper procedure? And Dr. Fauci claims that he himself is science made flesh, to question him is to question science. In our Daily Cancellation, we’ll deal with the New York Times article that generated controversy because it supposedly suggested that you shouldn’t have a lot of obese and depressed friends. But I think it makes a good point, I’ll explain why.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
