  "title": "Colin Milburn, “Mondo Nano: Fun and Games in the World of Digital Matter” (Duke UP, 2015)",
  "description": "Colin Milburn’s wonderful new book looks carefully and imaginatively at the relationship between nanotechnology and play. Mondo Nano: Fun and Games in the World of Digital Matter (Duke University Press, 2015) considers the many ways in which the research methods of nanotech and related fields blend with the practices of gaming, fiction, and fantasy in a world where scientists become gamers and gamers become scientists, a world filled with nanocars, nanotoilets, nanotaurs (nano-scale Minotaurs!), and nanopants. Milburn explores the spaces of this world, from islands to Second Life to a NanoCity. Incorporating chapters that are counted in binary (0000, 0001, 0010, 0011, etc.) and clues to a game hidden inside the narrative (!), Milburn’s book embodies the kind of play that the book explores. It’s a fun and fabulous work that blends literature, STS, and history.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
