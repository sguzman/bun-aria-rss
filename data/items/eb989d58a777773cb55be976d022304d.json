First up, Disney’s live action adaptation of the classic animated film ‘Mulan’.  Initially available on Disney+ at a premium price of $29.99 on top of the required membership, it’s now included at that base $7/$8 price tag.  Was it worth the wait or were we smart to pocket those $30 for other, more inappropriate expenses?  Then, we take a sharp left turn into the green inferno that is Ruggero Dedato’s ‘Cannibal Holocaust’, as our Banned Marathon continues to be the cherry on top of this hellish sundae of a year.  We’re talking week old ground beef, a banana peel, some hot dog water and a worn-out tennis shoe.  But is there a moral message for us to hang onto like a raft in a tsunami of horrible?  There’s the super-tight rundown of the big releases on physical media, featuring the Straight to DVD and Streaming Picks of the Week.  Matt and Chris then wrap up the show with 5 films they’re looking forward to in 2021.
