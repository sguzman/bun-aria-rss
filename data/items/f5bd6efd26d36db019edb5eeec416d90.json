There is so many issues we must deal with, from loneliness during a global pandemic, to addictive behaviours, codependency, worrying about the future and dealing with negative emotions—the list seems endless. Thankfully, we can face whatever life throws our way, as I discuss in this &nbsp;podcast with therapist Amanda White. It is possible to unlearn addiction, to get to the root of negative behaviors like eating disorders and codependency, to stop the worry cycle, to face and deal with our emotions and to heal our minds and lives. We don’t have to stay “stuck” in a bad place; we don’t have to be defined by what happens to us! &nbsp;Amanda also shares some great tips on how to deal with guilt and shame, the difference between the two, and how to deal with loneliness.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>For more info on Amanda visit: https://therapyforwomencenter.com&nbsp;</p>\n<p>And follow her on instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/therapyforwomen/ \">@therapyforwoman&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p>Podcast Highlights&nbsp;</p>\n<p>1:45 Why we need to talk about the overlap between addiction and eating disorders &nbsp;</p>\n<p>2:48 How Amanda overcame her eating disorder &nbsp;</p>\n<p>5:42 Addiction as a learned behavior&nbsp;</p>\n<p>8:58 What it the recovery time for addiction?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>10:44 What is codependency?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>21:00 What is the difference between shame and guilt?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>32:22 Dealing with loneliness&nbsp;</p>\n<p>47:30 What is the difference between worrying and planning?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>49:30 What is the difference between processing emotions and overthinking? &nbsp;</p>\n<p>Read the show blog here: &nbsp;https://drleaf.com/blogs/news/overcoming-codependency-addiction-guilt-and-shame-with-therapist-amanda-white</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Additional resources: &nbsp;</p>\n<p>-Sign up to join my free text program and receive mental health care tips and strategies, exclusive offers and more!
