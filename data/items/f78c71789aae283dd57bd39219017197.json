AND THIS IS NOT A RERUN! </strong>For our 100th episode, we're remaking our very first episode AND IT MIGHT BE OUR FUNNIEST, MOST PERFECT EPISODE YET!<br>\n<br>\nNicholas Barclay was 13 years old on the day he disappearedâ€”June 13, 1994. Three and a half years later he is found alive, thousands of miles away in a village in southern Spain. He says he was kidnapped and has suffered unimaginable torture. His family is overjoyed to bring him home. But all is not quite as it seems: The boy bears many of the same distinguishing marks he always had, but why does he now have a strange accent? Why does he look so different? And why doesn't the family seem to notice these glaring inconsistencies?<br>\n<br>\n<strong>LOOKING FOR MORE TCO?
