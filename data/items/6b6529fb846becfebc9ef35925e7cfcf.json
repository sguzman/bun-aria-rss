  "description": "<p>Tonight is a replay of my Bobby Hamilton interview. His encounter reminded me of the “Cowman of Copalis Beach” encounter story.</p> <p>Bobby Hamilton grew up in Garrison and Jacksonville and said he has had encounters with Sasquatch. Hamilton said his first one started in the winter when he was four years-old. “I’m walking in the bedroom with my head down and I hear something scratch the screen and I look up and there is this apish looking thing with an evil grin, because I could see teeth, and it was motioning with his hand for me to come to the window,” Hamilton said. Hamilton believes East Texas is the perfect sport for sightings of the primate because of the wooded areas to hide in and the abundance of fresh water.</p> <p>Hamilton also said he believes the public will soon start seeing more sightings. “We are having more encounters with these things coming up to people’s houses and killing their livestock,” because their environment is being torn down,” Hamilton said. Bobby Hamilton is a co-founder of the GCBRO. Now a days Bobby spends his free time researching and investigating reports of aggressive Sasquatch’s harassing locals. The GCBRO wants to harvest a body so that they can present real evidence to science and prove that in fact this creature does exists.  </p>",
