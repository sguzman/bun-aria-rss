  "description": "<p>My HoneyDew this week is Joe List! Joe is an alcoholic in recovery who suffers from panic disorder that results in horrific panic attacks. We get into some of his stories from his drinking days including defecating in a woman’s sneakers during a black out. We talk about the time he was completely edited out of a season of Last Comic Standing and if that's not HoneyDew enough, he also has herpes. I appreciate Joe and everyone who has come on the show and opened up. It's not easy to bare your soul.</p>",
