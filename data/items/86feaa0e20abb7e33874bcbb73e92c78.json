  "title": "Mark Levin Audio Rewind - 3/24/20",
  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, Governor Andrew Cuomo has known for quite some time about a shortage of I.C.U. beds and ventilators according to a 12-year-old article that highlights the need for such equipment in the event of a severe influenza pandemic. So why is Cuomo all of a sudden caught off guard and why is he pretending this is President Trump's responsibility and not his? How much has Cuomo budgeted for ventilators versus what they've budgeted for abortions? Then, it’s not a simple task to retool an assembly line to produce new items like GM has volunteered to do. Cuomo must realize that this lack of preparedness is on him, not the federal government or Trump. Later, abortion is a pandemic yet Nancy Pelosi is using it to stall the stimulus package claiming that aid for abortion is necessary under the small business protections portion of the coronavirus stimulus bill. Afterward, hydroxychloroquine continues to show anecdotal success with patients in NYC. Meanwhile, the Yellow Fever plague of 1793 killed nearly 5,000 people in Philadelphia when there were no additional hospital beds or ventilators. Dr. Benjamin Rush led the charge to improve hygiene and curtail the fever. Indeed America has endured much through the years and will endure COVID19 as well.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
