  "description": "Happy New Year! The first episode of The Readheads 2022 is all about The Simple Wild by K.A. Tucker, a Snitch's choice in every sense. The hosts talk about their favorite (and least favorite) characters, plot lines and ultimately their overall thoughts on the book. Plus they're sharing all of the other books they read over the holidays and rating those books as well. The next book is Becky's choice and she chose Ghosts of Gotham by Craig Schaefer.
