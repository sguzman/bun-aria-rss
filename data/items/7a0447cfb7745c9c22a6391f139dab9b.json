Not by a long shot.\nOn today's episode of our weekly legal news podcast, On The Merits, employment law reporter Erin Mulvaney joins us to talk about what the Equal Employment Opportunity Commission just did. She explains why the agency is addressing both employers who aren't recognizing a disability, and employers who are tagging their workers as disabled unwillingly.\n\nHave feedback on this episode of On The Merits?
