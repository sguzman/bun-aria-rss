  "description": "<p>One of the leading lights of the SNP and one of the most talented politicians in Scotland&nbsp;gives a funny and candid account of his time in government and politics so far. The Justice Secretary talks openly about the political challenges facing him and his party as well as the&nbsp;personal challenges he's faced in his life. (Including how he manages to campaign in an election taking place during Covid and Ramadan). Humza also reflects on the debates around the Hate Crime Bill and the Gender Recognition Act and the lessons learned from how both have been conducted and perceived. In short, this episode has everything: political analysis, personal reflections and funny stories.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><strong>Get your tickets for the Political Party Specials at The Garrick Theatre and Vaudeville Theatre here:</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><a href=\"https://www.nimaxtheatres.com/shows/matt-fordes-political-party-podcast/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nimaxtheatres.com/shows/matt-fordes-political-party-podcast/</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Monday 24 May:&nbsp;<strong>Peter Mandelson&nbsp;</strong>and<strong>&nbsp;Sayeeda Warsi</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Tuesday 25 May:&nbsp;<strong>Keir Starmer&nbsp;</strong>and<strong>&nbsp;Andrea Leadsom</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Wednesday 2 June:&nbsp;<strong>Jess Phillips&nbsp;</strong>and<strong>&nbsp;Esther McVey</strong></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Follow&nbsp;Humza&nbsp;on Twitter: @HumzaYousaf</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Email the show: <a href=\"mailto:politicalpartypodcast@gmail.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">politicalpartypodcast@gmail.com</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Apply to vote by post here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-for-a-postal-vote\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.gov.uk/government/publications/apply-for-a-postal-vote</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Order Matt's book 'Politically Homeless' here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://blackwells.co.uk/bookshop/product/2100000262618\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://blackwells.co.uk/bookshop/product/2100000262618</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Follow Matt on Twitter: @mattforde</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Follow Matt on WTSocial:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wt.social/u/matt-forde\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://wt.social/u/matt-forde</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>For the latest UK Government advice on coronavirus go to:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.gov.uk/coronavirus</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
