  "description": "<p><strong>This is Voxology</strong>. Welcome to episode <strong>300</strong> and to the new podcast name, <strong>Voxology</strong>! We’re excited to start a new chapter in this continued journey with all of you!</p>\n<p>Today in this mammoth, celebratory episode, we spend time talking about the Church, from postures of both lament and hope. We hear from beloved friend and old co-host <strong>Bonnie Lewis</strong> on why she feels she is ‘post-church,’ from friend of the show <strong>Shane Claiborne</strong> on actions the church needs to take to heal and grow and from the one and only <strong>Gombis</strong> on where we’ve been and hope for the future. Then, most importantly, we hear from many of you. You share your hopes and laments with us as we look further on down the long road.</p>\n<p>First, Tim puts Mike on the hot seat to talk about why he started a podcast in the first place six years ago and what his hopes are for the next 300 episodes.</p>\n<p>As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
