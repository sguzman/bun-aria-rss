  "description": "In his new book, Developer’s Dilemma: The Secret World of Videogame Creators (MIT Press, 2014), Casey O’Donnell, an assistant professor in the department of Media and Information in the College of Communication Arts at Michigan State University, takes the reader inside the game development process. An ethnographic study of the people and the process of videogame creation, Developer’s Dilemma considers the interactions between engineers and designers, publishers and executives, all motivated to ship out the completed product to the public. The dynamics of these relationships are shaped by the organizations, policies, and the marketplace, leading to a system of creative and collaborative practice that is not always in balance.\n\nO’Donnell uses the imagery of the videogames in his book, breaking the chapters into levels that include “bosses” and final rants. Both the book design and O’Donnell’s masterful storytelling provide much-needed insight into the obscure world of videogame development. Just listen.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
