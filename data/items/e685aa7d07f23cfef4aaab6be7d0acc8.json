  "description": "<p><i>The Twilight Zone</i> is arguably one of the best and most influential shows in television history. The reason it endures, and is still being watched and talked about more than sixty years after its debut, can not only be traced to its superior storytelling and innovations in the genres of horror, science fiction, and fantasy, but the fact that each episode is embedded with a lesson on how to grapple with life's moral and existential dilemmas.</p><p>Here to unpack those life lessons is Mark Dawidziak, author of <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3gLD1d9\"><i>Everything I Need to Know I Learned in the Twilight Zone</i></a>. Today on the show, Mark and I discuss the parable-like morals from a selection of <i>Twilight Zone</i> episodes, drawn from those that are my favorites, Mark's favorites, and simply classic.
