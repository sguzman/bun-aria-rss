  "description": "<p>Udi Wertheimer is a notorious persona on crypto twitter and is endlessly difficult to pin down. At the very least, Udi is an interesting and unique character, describing himself as a cynical optimist with a tendency to antagonize and troll.</p> <p>Udi is also insightful and pragmatic, constantly making connections and critiques of the space with a sharp eye and a relentless desire to call things out when he disagrees. He blurs a lot of lines, and you always have to be on your toes when Udi’s around.</p> <p>There’s value in having members in the community who never give the benefit of the doubt and act as a philosophical razor for the space. Udi is full of takes, and this conversation twists and turns through the entirety of crypto—trading, culture, communities, memes, the metaverse, and beyond.</p> <p>------<br /> 📣 ONJUNO | Crypto from your Checking Account!<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/OnJuno\">https://bankless.cc/OnJuno</a> </p> <p>------<br /> 🚀 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER: <a href= \"https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/\">https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/</a> <br />  🎙️ SUBSCRIBE TO PODCAST: <a href= \"http://podcast.banklesshq.com/\">http://podcast.banklesshq.com/</a> </p> <p>------<br /> BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS:</p> <p>⚖️ ARBITRUM | SCALING ETHEREUM<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum\">https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum</a> </p> <p>🍵 MATCHA | SMART ORDER ROUTING<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Matcha\">https://bankless.cc/Matcha</a> </p> <p>🚀 SLINGSHOT | LAYER 2 SOCIAL TRADING<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Slingshot\">https://bankless.cc/Slingshot</a> </p> <p>🏦 GEMINI | TURN FIAT INTO CRYPTO<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Gemini\">https://bankless.cc/Gemini</a> </p> <p>🦁 BRAVE | THE BROWSER NATIVE WALLET<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Brave\">https://bankless.cc/Brave</a> </p> <p>🦄 UNISWAP | DECENTRALIZED FUNDING<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/UniGrants\">https://bankless.cc/UniGrants</a> </p> <p>------<br /> Topics Covered:</p> <p>0:00 Intro<br /> 3:30 Udi, a Meme Tactition<br /> 9:08 Trading Ponzis<br /> 15:58 Not Changing the World<br /> 22:22 Optimism, Memes, Community<br /> 30:20 Winners & Decentralization<br /> 38:33 Composability & User Experience<br /> 42:14 SBF and Competition<br /> 49:10 Culture & Meme Communities<br /> 55:30 Bitcoin Twitter vs Bitcoin Reality<br /> 1:01:00 Pricing Values<br /> 1:06:30 Critique of Ethereum & Bankless<br /> 1:14:53 2022, Metaverse, Resolutions<br /> 1:22:19 Closing & Disclaimers</p> <p>------<br /> Resources:</p> <p>Udi on Twitter:<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/udiWertheimer?s=20\">https://twitter.com/udiWertheimer?s=20</a> </p> <p>-----<br /> Not financial or tax advice.
