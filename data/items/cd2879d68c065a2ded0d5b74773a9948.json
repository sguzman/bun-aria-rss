  "description": "<p>Transformer-based pre-trained language models such as BERT have achieved\nremarkable results in Semantic Sentence Matching. However, existing models\nstill suffer from insufficient ability to capture subtle differences. Minor\nnoise like word addition, deletion, and modification of sentences may cause\nflipped predictions. To alleviate this problem, we propose a novel Dual\nAttention Enhanced BERT (DABERT) to enhance the ability of BERT to capture\nfine-grained differences in sentence pairs. DABERT comprises (1) Dual Attention\nmodule, which measures soft word matches by introducing a new dual channel\nalignment mechanism to model affinity and difference attention. (2) Adaptive\nFusion module, this module uses attention to learn the aggregation of\ndifference and affinity features, and generates a vector describing the\nmatching details of sentence pairs. We conduct extensive experiments on\nwell-studied semantic matching and robustness test datasets, and the\nexperimental results show the effectiveness of our proposed method.\n</p>",
