  "description": "On Wednesday’s Mark Levin show, slavery is one of the the most awful events that has ever occurred in this country but we shouldn't have to pay one penny for reparations. The vast majority of us were neither the progeny of slaves or slave holders. This is a scam; it’s the latest push by left to divide this country. Also, Joe Biden is coming under attack from democrat presidential candidates over his comments about segregationist senators. Cory Booker and Kamala Harris said Biden was wrong. But if the democrat party had its way with slavery Booker and Harris wouldn’t be running for president right now. Later, CNN cut away from President Trump’s speech to 20,000 people in a packed arena after 6 minutes. They cut Trump’s speech after the crowd chanted “CNN sucks” and after he bashed the press. Whether Trump attacks them or not, they should air his speech, which wasn’t a pseudo-event.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
