  "description": "Who was that masked man? Was it the Barefoot Bandit, the Mummy Bandit, or perhaps the Botox Bandit? Or maybe it was the Bad-Breath Bandit? The hosts discuss the wacky names that law enforcement officers give to suspects. Also, what's a pickle button? Why do we say be there or be square? And what does the word seditty mean in the African-American community?A news story about the Ho-Hum Bandit has Grant musing about the odd names that law enforcement officers give to criminals at large, usually based on their appearance or behavior, like the Barefoot Bandit, the Mummy Bandit. Or how about the Bad Breath Bandit?Where do we get the phrase be there or be square?What's seditty? Many African-Americans use this term, also spelled saddidy, to mean \"stuck-up.\" A caller's heard it all his life, and is curious about the word.Grant has a riddle: \"I never was, am always to be, no one ever saw me or ever will, and yet I am the confidence of all to live and breathe on this terrestrial ball. What am I?\"Quiz Guy Greg Pliska offers a colorful variation on his ever-popular \"Odd Man Out\" puzzle. In this series, for example, which one doesn't belong: Imperial, Shasta, Kings, and Orange. A caller from the coastal town of La Jolla, California, is sure he's heard a word for bright pools of silver light that form on the surface of the ocean when sunbeams poke down through cloud cover.
