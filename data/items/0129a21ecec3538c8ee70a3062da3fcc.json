  "description": "In Episode #214, I sit down with Josh Tetrick to discuss reshaping our food system towards plant-based products and slaughter-free meat alternatives.\n\nAs animal-free proteins grow in popularity, technologies for creating them are too. Josh Tetrick wants to reshape our food system, and joins me today to share his journey with Eat Just. Josh is committed to facilitating innovation in the plant-based sphere and offers valuable insight into emerging technologies in today’s episode.\n\nIn this episode, we discuss business as a force for change and the future of the animal-free industry. Josh shares some of his story, explaining where he found the drive to act and how he raised more than half a billion dollars. We look deeper into Eat Just’s products, specifically their very successful “Just Egg”. We also discuss the nutritional profile of cultivated meat and other plant-based alternatives; challenges Josh has overcome; and the benefits of alternative products.\n\nSpecifically, we cover:\n\nIntro (0:00)\n\nJosh’s Story (2:20)\n\nHaving the Courage to Act (9:51)\n\nEvaluating the Meat Industry (20:12)\n\nThe Mission of JUST (29:10)\n\nNegative Press & The Egg Industry (47:27)\n\nCultivated Meat (1:10:30)\n\nChallenges & Pushback (1:36:24)\n\nNutritional Profile (1:44:58)\n\nSkeptics & Timeline (1:48:32)\n\nOutro (2:05:47)\n\n\nTo connect with Josh, you can find him on Twitter or send him an email.
