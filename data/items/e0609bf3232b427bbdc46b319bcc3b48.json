  "description": "<p>We are proud to present a new installment of The Old Man and The Three's 'Coaching Series' where we dive deep into the insights and strategy of the top coaches in basketball. In this episode, we welcome former NBA player, form Head Coach of The NBA Champion Cleveland Cavaliers and current head coach of The Los Angeles Clippers, Tyronn Lue. Ty Lue has cemented himself as one of the best coaches in The NBA and we are so psyched to share this conversation. Topics include: Ty's brief time playing with JJ Redick in Orlando, how he first got into coaching, what he learned from Doc Rivers in Boston, what he learned from Phil Jackson on The Los Angeles Lakers, why he feels former players are uniquely suited to coach in The NBA, what it was like coaching LeBron James, Kyrie Irving and Kevin Love on The Cleveland Cavaliers, the unique way he inspired and motivated his team when they were down 3-1 to The Golden State Warriors in the 2016 NBA Finals, coaching Kawhi Leonard on The Los Angeles Clippers, his message to The Clippers going into this season, what he learned from playing with Kobe Bryant and Michael Jordan and what makes those guys different from everyone else and of course we had to ask about the iconic Allen Iverson step-over. Also in this episode, JJ and Tommy discuss their initial takaways from the first week of the NBA season and JJ clears the air on a Lakers take that has since been aggregated and criticized.</p><p><br></p><p>Subscribe to The Old Man and The Three podcast w/ JJ Redick and Tommy Alter on YouTube and wherever you get your podcasts.</p><p><br></p><p><em>If you or someone you know has a gambling problem, crisis counseling and referral services can be accessed by calling 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537) (IL/IN/LA/MI/NJ/TN/PA/WV/WY), 1-800-NEXT STEP (AZ), 1-800-522-4700 (CO/KS/NH), 888-789-7777/visit ccpg.org (CT), 1-800-BETS OFF (IA), 877-8-HOPENY/text HOPENY (467369) (NY), visit OPGR.org (OR), or 1-888-532-3500 (VA).</em></p><p><em>21+ (18+ NH/WY).
