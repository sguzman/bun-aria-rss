  "description": "<p>Tom Sewid returns tonight to wrap-up our interview on the First Nations encounters with Sasquatch. Tom and I will be discussing the Bukwas or the little people. I hope every enjoys this final holiday series of the First Nations encounters with Sasquatch. Check out Tom's website <a href=\"http://www.hamoomooadventures.com\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HERE</a>.</p> <p>Tom was born on a small island off northeast Vancouver Island British Columbia Canada called Alert Bay. This is the modern epicenter for the northern Kwakwaka’wakw (Kwakiutl) First Nations Tribes, otherwise known as Canadian Indians. Raised with the rich culture and heritage of this coastal First Nations Tribe, he was brought up hearing the stories of the animal kingdom and seeing the great ceremony known as Potlatch. At Potlatch he has witnessed the ancient dances with carved masks and beautiful traditional regalia hosted in the great buildings known as Bighouse’s. Raised to be a commercial seine fisherman from an early age he would work his way up the ranks to be a captain of salmon seine boats during the 1990s. Thomas has also participated in numerous other commercial fisheries throughout the entire British Columbia coast. During this time, he would meet other First Nations from throughout the coast and hear their stories pertaining to the Sasquatch/Bigfoot.</p>",
