  "description": "<p>r/Entitledparents In today's episode, OP was in Texas during the power outage. For some reason, his crazy neighbor Karen decides that she would rather live in OP's house during the outage, so she comes up and knocks on his door, demanding to live in his house. OP turns her down (obviously), so she forces her way inside and refuses to leave. Luckily, OP is able to trick her out of the house by telling her that he'll grab her a key, and then he locks the door behind her!</p>\n",
