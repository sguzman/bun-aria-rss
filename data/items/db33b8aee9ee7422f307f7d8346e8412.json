What's driving people to leave their jobs in droves?  What can a leader do to stem the flow? </p><p>Recorded as a Live broadcast on LinkedIn on October 1st, leadership experts <a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/heather-marasse\">Heather Marasse,</a><a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/wendy-appel\">Wendy Appel</a> and <a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/mary-beth-sawicki\">Mary Beth Sawicki</a> look at what's behind this trend and offer great advice and practical tips to help leaders navigate it.  </p><p>COVID continues to affect every corner of our lives. And “This pandemic has given everyone a chance to see what was really important in life,” explains Wendy Appel, Founding Partner, Trilogy Effect. “When lives are at stake, when your children's lives may be at stake, people are reprioritizing. While work is important, people started asking themselves some tough questions. For instance, do I want to spend so much time away from my family travelling for business? Do I want to spend two hours of each day on a commute?” </p><p>Recent statistics show that 4 million Americans quit their jobs this past July. And a survey of Canadian workers found that 42 per cent of employees would quit their job if remote working is not offered going forward. This presents an enormous challenge for today’s leaders.</p><p>It’s clear that, despite the impetus to return to work, people are not ready to give up the flexibility of working from home. And yet, leaders must continue to make decisions in running their businesses. </p><p>Trilogy Effect’s Managing Partner explains, “Leaders are in the throes of making big decisions about the business models, about real estate, their operations. And they answer to boards, to shareholders and to the public. We’ve been in a holding pattern for more than 18 months, but we are now realising that the return to work is not a problem which needs solving, so much as it is a journey we’re taking together that is full of continual shifts and course alterations. And we don’t know what the end looks like.”</p><p>The trend is not so much the great resignation as it is the great ‘awakening’, according to Mary Beth Sawicki, Trilogy Effect Founding Partner. “Business leaders need to recognize their responsibility in supporting people in their lives as well as their work.It’s more than work/life balance, it’s work/life integration. They need to listen to their people, and ensure they feel seen and understood. To successfully navigate through these unusual times, leaders must let humanity flourish.” </p><h2>Listen to the full LIVE episode to learn: </h2><ul><li>Why are people leaving their employers?</li><li>What are the hot button issues behind the great resignation? </li><li>Why is being human good for business? </li></ul><p>Links to information about the issues discussed in the is show: </p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/blog/podcast-how-to-be-a-better-leader-by-being-a-better-listener\"><strong>How to be a better leader by being a better listener</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/free-leadership-guidebook\"><strong>Trilogy Effect Leadership Guidebook</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/blog/podcast-ea\"><strong>Electronic Arts’ People-Centered Approach to Business</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"https://business.facebook.com/trilogyeffect\">Facebook </a>| <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/company/trilogy-effect/?viewAsMember=true\">LinkedIn </a>| <a href=\"https://twitter.com/_TrilogyEffect\">Twitter </a>| <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/trilogyeffectleaders/\">Instagram</a></li></ul><p>We invite you to subscribe to the Being Human Is Good for Business Podcast on iTunes, Amazon, Google Podcasts, iHeart Radio and Spotify (links below) or wherever you get your podcasts.
