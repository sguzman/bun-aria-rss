  "description": "It is said that an old actor on his deathbed once said, \"Dying is easy. Comedy is hard.\" Whether that actually happened or not, the foreign policy equivalent may be \"Invading a country is easy. Turning it into a democracy is hard.\" The US discovers this on the regular...and each time it is as though it had never happened before. We discuss with regard to Afghanistan...and many other instances. And if modern day Americans did not have enough evidence all around us to remind us of how tough it it is to establish and maintain a democracy, we suggest that perhaps you could have asked John Hanson, first president of the United States. Join Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law School and host, David Rothkopf, for this lively and entertaining discussion.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
