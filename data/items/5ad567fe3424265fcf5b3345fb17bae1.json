  "description": "<p>We've all experienced it - we're working on a painting we love and then ... oops, we make a few wrong moves and the whole thing feels ruined. Or, as recently happened to Louise, we'e working in a painting late at night, feeling really good about it, and then come back in the next morning to find nothing is as we thought. But is this really a problem? In this episode, we discuss that sinking feeling and offer a different viewpoint. During our conversation, we dig into the stages of a painting, discuss whether we have ever actually ruined anything, rail against the use of gesso to 'just cover it up,' and agree on the importance of intention as a guiding principle. We also share our thoughts on a new art book and digress into a slightly nerdy discussion about Mailchimp.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>Remembering in Paint by David Mankin <a href=\"https://www.david-mankin.com/book\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.david-mankin.com/book</a></p>\n<p>Find our websites and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/\">www.alicesheridan.com&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p>@alicesheridanstudio</p>\n<p>@louisefletcher_art</p>\n<p>Credits: \"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n<p><br></p>\n",
