  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, what is liberty? We're pushing back on socialism, big government and collectivism. We need to get back to the fundamentals because there's no debate. The Conservative intellectual movement is all but dead. The mindset of the country has changed; we should have a revolution for individual liberty, not centralized government control. We are handicapped by national populists that want to help certain groups over others. Could you imagine someone telling the founders that we'd one day have the federal government controlling healthcare, childcare and higher education? John Stuart Mill taught that some modern reformers that opposed the religions of the past never considered the long-term effects of their teachings on the populace; to encroach on one's individuals liberty and support the collective group is evil because it feeds power to the state. To reiterate Isaiah Berlin’s positive liberty is the capacity to act upon one's free will, while negative liberty is freedom from external restraint on one's actions and internal constraints. Berlin theorized that the pursuit of utopia thrives on discord. People need to be engaged in these debates because to ignore these warnings is perilous. Then, Bernie Sanders' socialist policies are the perfect example of tyrannical governance, totally disregarding our negative liberty. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez misrepresents a 91% marginal tax rate (which no one ever paid, due to tax breaks) in her latest attempt to appear morally superior in her argument to tax earnings of over $10M. However, taking 70% of a family's earnings through AOC's tax plan is the real act of immorality here.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
