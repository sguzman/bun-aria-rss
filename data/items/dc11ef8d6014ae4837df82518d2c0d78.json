Releasing a preliminary third quarter financial results statement, AMD is reporting that revenues for the quarter will come in at around $5.6 billion, which is over $1 billion below AMD&rsquo;s previous guidance of $6.7 billion. Driving this unexpected drop in revenues is an exceptionally weak client market, with revenues down 40% versus Q3&rsquo;21 and resulting in what&rsquo;s traditionally AMD&rsquo;s largest market segment by revenue becoming their smallest.</p>\n</p>",
