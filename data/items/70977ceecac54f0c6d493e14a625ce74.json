  "description": "I AM BLACK | Season 2: Episode 3\n\nAthlete, activist, author, and former NFL player, Michael Bennett, along with Athletes for Impact celebrate the beauty and resiliency of the African Diaspora with family and friends. The beginning of the event started out with greetings, connecting and a whole lot of food hosted by African Chop House.\n\nMichael Bennett gives a warm welcome to the audience and explains why he’s doing this event, and the main focus of it. “So this is a great opportunity to not focus on the victimization of it but focus on how we’re building…”.Guerline M. Jozef, President of the Haitian Bridge Alliance started off the panel by focusing on what’s happening down at the Mexican border. She starts to become emotional when explaining how the Haitians who made the journey from Brazil to the United States were being whipped by white people on the back of horses. She explains how the people are just trying to escape their internal crisis by seeking refuge through the United States.  \n\nA woman in the crowd speaks up and asks the group “What are the plans to teach us how to  fish?” when referring to the analogy of giving a man a fish. The Co-Founder of ‘Black Lives Matter’, Patrisse Cullors and the Founder of Alaffia, Olowo n’djo Tchala both respond to the woman. Patrisse explains how the black community needs to create things that are self-sustaining, and that can be reused, shared but also taken care of over time by other black people. She refers to using black farmers as a way to teach people how to take care of a water source over long periods of time. Olowo explains how he would set people up in the right situations for success if he can. He can teach his students what to do and how to do it, but ultimately it is up to them whether or not they try and get a job and perform the task at hand.\n\nMichael ends the panel by thanking everyone for showing up and thanking the hosts for the conversations that were made. \n\nWATCH MORE:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\n\nSUBSCRIBE: https://www.youtube.com/c/IAMATHLETE\n\nFollow I AM ATHLETE:\nOfficial Site: https://iamathletetv.com/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/iamathlete\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/IAMATHLETEpod\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/iamathlete/...\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@iamathlete_po...\nLinkedin: https://www.linkedin.com/company/i-am...\n\nFollow HOUSE OF ATHLETE:\nOfficial Site: https://houseofathlete.com/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/thehouseofa...\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/houseofathlete\nApparel Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/houseofathl...\nHoA Supplements: https://houseofathlete.com/supplements\n\n#IAMATHLETE #BiggerThanAPodcast #BrandonMarshall #MichaelBennett #Black #BlackHistory #February #BlackHistoryMonth",
