  "title": "Uncle Si's Bathroom Antics Are LEGENDARY",
  "description": "Si unintentionally gives new meaning to \"potty humor,\" and Stone has been laughing about one particular incident for 15 years. Martin and Si kick off a VERY open dialogue about their recent bathroom misery, and that leads to stories about the Robertson family's personal hygiene and other tales from the duck blind that have never been told in public. It's possible Bullfrog has been hanging around Si too much, but is the world ready for a female Si? JD is amazed by 1980s bear wrestling at the mall, and Si and Stone have mixed reviews for ice fishing and dog sledding. Bonus: Stone does an incredible Si impression.\n-\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
