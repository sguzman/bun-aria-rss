  "description": "<p>We present an algorithm for the computer-aided analytical construction of the\nVoronoi cells of lattices with known symmetry group. This algorithm is applied\nto the Coxeter-Todd lattice $K_{12}$ as well as to a family of lattices\nobtained from laminating $K_{12}$. This way, we obtain a locally optimal\nlattice quantizer in 13 dimensions representing a new best quantizer among the\nlattices with published exact quantizer constants.\n</p>",
