  "title": "That's Deep Bro Episode 1 Jenny Pentland and Why We Aren't Happy For Very Long",
  "description": "<p>This isn't your mother's podcast. The first episode of That's Deep, Bro covers some ideas found in Buddhism like non-attachment, suffering and what it means to be happy. With my guest Jenny Pentland, we explore the idea of why as humans we are never really happy from external things and how we can achieve a sense of well being in a world that is always changing. And Jenny knows a little sumpin' sumpin' about change. The daughter of legendary comedian Roseanne Barr, Jenny has lived thru many changes and bizarro experiences that would break anyone's spirit. Thankfully, Jenny has a fantastic perspective on life and graciously shares it with us. Have you ever found out your parents were getting a divorce from reading the tabloids? Ever had Tom Arnold as a stepdad or spent 5 years in various mental institutions? Jenny has and surprisingly has hilarious stories about all of it. You'll laugh, you'll cry (we did a few times, no really) and at the end you'll say \"woah, that's deep, bro.\"</p>\n",
