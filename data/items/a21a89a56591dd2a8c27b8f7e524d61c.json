But that alarming trajectory is not set in stone, panelists at BoF VOICES, BoF’s annual gathering for big thinkers, said. Dr Dambisa Moyo, an economist and author who drew the comparison, said she was “optimistic in many respects,” and sees technological innovation as one way out of the global economy’s current troubles. That’s not to downplay the challenges. Journalist Felix Salmon described an economic “balkanisation” that was making it more difficult for cross-border business, while noting that China’s rapid rebound from Covid-19 could power global markets.</p> <p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em>Related Articles:</em></p> <p style=\"text-align:left;\"><em><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/videos/news-analysis/hans-ulrich-obrist-voices-talk-mondialisation-versus-globalisation'> Hans Ulrich Obrist: The Antidote to Globalisation</a> <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/news-analysis/voices-2020-finding-opportunity-in-a-global-crisis'> VOICES 2020: Finding Opportunity in a Global Crisis</a></em></p> <p style=\"text-align:left;\"> </p> Find out more about #BoFVOICES <a href= 'https://events.businessoffashion.com/'>here</a>.   To contact <a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/organisations/the-business-of-fashion'> The Business of Fashion</a> with comments, questions or speaker ideas please email <a href= 'mailto:podcast@businessoffashion.com'>podcast@businessoffashion.com</a>.   Sign up for BoF’s <a href='http://bit.ly/BoFnews'>Daily Digest newsletter</a>.   Ready to become a BoF Professional?
