They also talk about how he formed the Blue Collar Comedy Tour and how he feels about being known for his &ldquo;You Might Be A Redneck&rdquo; hook even though it hasn't been part of his act for 20 years. <p>Sign up here for WTF+ to get the full show archives and weekly bonus material!  <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast\">https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast</a>.</p>\n\n<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
