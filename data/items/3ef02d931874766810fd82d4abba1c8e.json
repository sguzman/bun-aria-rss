  "description": "<p>Patriotic. Principled. Hilarious. Tom Blenkinsop is all three of those things and so much more. This is full of brilliant stories of trade union fist fights, his father's involvement in D Day and searing political sense. Tom was the&nbsp;Labour MP for his hometown from 2010 to 2017. He stood down at the 2017 election in protest against Jeremy Corbyn's leadership. That was just one of many principled decisions Tom has taken in his life. He's a member of the Army Reserve and explains his support for monarchy and what it means to members of the armed forces.
