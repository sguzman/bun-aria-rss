  "description": "<p>On today’s show, Pat discusses the monumental shift in sports right now as it pertains to social justice reforms, and how the Milwaukee Bucks led the way in putting the sporting world in a position it hasn’t been in for a very long time. Joining the show from the NBA bubble is NBA Insider for The Athletic and Stadium, friend of the program, Shams Charania. Pat and Shams discuss everything that was talked about in the players meeting on Wednesday night, speculate about what was said during the Board of Governor’s meeting (we now know that the NBA will resume the playoffs), what the ultimate goal will be moving forward, and whether or not the players would hurt their ability to shine light on the changes they want to see if they were to abandon the season and leave the bubble (7:18-17:08). Next, friend of PMI, 9 year NFL veteran at DB, co-host of the Man-To-Man Pod, creator of Everything DB, maybe the smoothest athlete to ever walk the face of the earth, Darius Butler joins the show. Darius breaks down the plight of being a black athlete in America and why things are so much different now than they were 4 years ago when Colin Kaepernick decided to take a knee. He explains the ramifications of trying to make societal changes, why more guys feel more comfortable being a part of this movement now, and ultimately what needs to be done so we can see this change enacted (19:56-29:02). Later, NFL Insider from NFL Network, Ian Rapoport joins the program to chat about all the different NFL teams that have decided to postpone or cancel practices, how hands on Roger Goodell is in this whole situation, what he’s seen from the different Covid protocols and whether or not they seem to be working, his thoughts on kind of getting body bagged by Jerry Jones in relation to Earl Thomas potentially going to the Cowboys (Ian doesn’t believe so), and who he is hearing may be interested in Earl Thomas (31:06-50:15). To close out the show, 4x Pro Bowler, All-Pro, NFL Rookie of the Year, Heisman Trophy winner, member of the Tennessee Titans/Houston Oilers Ring of Honor, and Ohio State legend, Eddie George joins the program. Pat and Eddie chat about the current situation with Ohio State, and what Eddie thinks top prospects will ultimately do when faced with not having a fall season, what he thinks they’ll do with all the awards, why the RB position is so undervalued now, his thoughts on the upcoming NFL season, how his financial planning business is going, and his thoughts about playing golf at the AAC Challenge in Lake Tahoe (51:20-1:09:39). We appreciate the hell out of all of you for listening, have an incredible weekend. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
