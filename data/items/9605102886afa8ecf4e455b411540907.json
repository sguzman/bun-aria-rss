  "description": "<p>On today's show, Oregon Quarterback and potential top 5 pick in tonight's NFL Draft, Justin Herbert joins the show. Pat and Justin chat about what this process has been like for him, which teams he has been in contact with the most, if he has signed a Nike contract yet, what he has been doing to prepare during quarantine, and what he plans to wear on draft night (00:00:50-14:57). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk, as Pat and AJ react to the Gronk news, and AJ gives his best guess as to how teams will try to defend the Buccaneers. Plus WWE commentator and Pittsburgh native, Corey Graves joins the show to give his thoughts on Gronk coming back, whether anyone in the WWE thought he was staying there for good, and what he hopes the Pittsburgh Steelers will do in tonight's draft (18:08-1:20:49). Later, former #1 overall pick in the 2003 NFL Draft, 3x Pro Bowler, All-Pro, and friend of the program, Carson Palmer calls in. Pat and Carson chat about his relationship with Joe Burrow and whether he has given him any advice, why he thinks Burrow has the chance to be very successful in Cincinnati, his thoughts on being linked with Burrow potentially not wanting to play in Cinci, and what he sees for the Bucs offense this year with Brady at the helm (1:24:00-1:41:32). Lastly, the 13th pick in the 1998 NFL Draft, 2x Pro Bowler, All-Pro, and host of the Behind The Mask Podcast, Takeo Spikes joins the show via FaceTime. Takeo chats about why he thinks Joe Burrow is going to be successful, what he looked at in a rookie quarterback to see whether or not they were going to be any good, which is more important to draft in his opinion, a stud defensive lineman/end or a cornerback, and who some of the toughest running back's&nbsp;he ever had to tackle were (1:41:34-1:58:01).
