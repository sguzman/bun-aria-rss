  "description": "<p>How should you approach purchasing a home? With more millennials buying a home for the first time ever, there is a ton of room for mistakes. And there is a lot on the line as well- the average price of a new home now exceeds $300k, so there are a lot of things to consider in order to make a wise purchase! At the same time, mortgage interest rates are at all-time lows. That creates a feeling like you have to move quickly before those rates start to creep back up. But if you move too quickly, you could end up overpaying for that house or not considering the bigger financial impact. We’re going to answer some questions like ‘Does renting make more sense?’, ‘What’s the purpose of this house?’, and ‘What’s your timeline?’. This episode is all about what it looks like to have a solid home buying strategy in place, so that you make a smart buy.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a La Bonte with Figs by Wicked Weed! And as we’ve ramped up the podcast with an additional Friday episode every week, we could really use your help to spread the word- let friends and family know about How to Money!
