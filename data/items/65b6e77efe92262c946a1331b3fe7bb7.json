  "description": "In this message, Joel offers hope and practical advice to those who feel like they are experiencing a dry place in life. We all have seasons when we experience heartache and loss, when we feel like we are just going through the motions of life. The key is not to allow those times to become permanent. If you are in a wilderness, make the decision to worship God when you don’t feel like it, to fix your eyes on His promises. In dry seasons, it can be easy to stay in self-pity, to get stuck in a negative mentality, but you don’t have to let the dryness get in you. Outwardly, you can be experiencing a drought, but inwardly you can tap into the endless supply that God has for you. Get your hopes up and begin to expect that rain is coming and the drought is ending.<p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
