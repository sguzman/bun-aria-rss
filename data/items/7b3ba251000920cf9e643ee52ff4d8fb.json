I&rsquo;ve had no complaints with this\nblogging stack: the only thing I pay for is the custom\n<a href=\"https://eigenfoo.xyz/\"><code>eigenfoo.xyz</code></a> domain name, which costs the same as\nmaybe two or three cups of coffee a year.</p>\n<hr>\n<p><strong>Update (2022-03-06):</strong> I&rsquo;ve since made several changes to this blog, which\nyou can read about in <a href=\"https://www.georgeho.org/migrating-to-hugo\">a subsequent blog post</a>.</p>"
