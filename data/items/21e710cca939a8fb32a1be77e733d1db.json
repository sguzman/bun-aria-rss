  "description": "<p>With everything going on in the world recently, we've likely all thought to ourselves at some point, \"Is humanity lost?\" You are not alone if the news makes you feel like everything is hopeless, and it's fair to wonder if collective and individual hope in empathy, compassion, and humanity will ever be restored.&nbsp;</p><br><p>As we move forward past the darkest days of the COVID-19 outbreak, many people are still searching for hope, inspiration, and answers to some big questions like: How do you regain access to empathy? Or what truly matters in life in the end?&nbsp;</p><br><p>And I can't think of a better person to explore these questions with than my guest today, Rabbi Steve Leder.&nbsp;</p><br><p>He is a graduate of Northwestern University and was ordained at Hebrew Union College, and he currently serves as the Senior Rabbi of Wilshire Boulevard Temple in Los Angeles.

In this revealing conversation, we explore his views on humanity, death, religion, and what makes a good life well-lived.</p><br><p>Rabbi Leder shares his interesting thoughts on why people leave the church, what he believes to be the true single source of evil, and how we can all get back to living in alignment with our values and also how to create a powerful curation of beliefs and stories to share with others he calls your ethical will.
