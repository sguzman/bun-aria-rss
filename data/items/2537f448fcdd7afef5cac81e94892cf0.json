  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, America continues to limp toward tyranny as a lawyer presents an open and shut case to a jury that was not objective and comprised of a few donors to the Hillary Clinton campaign and other ties to the judge. What America witnessed today, with the Michael Sussman not guilty verdict, was jury nullification. The testimony presented by John Durham was clearly overwhelming, yet the jury felt it didn't meet the standard of guilty beyond a shadow of a doubt. This is a big deal. Then, the U.S Marshal investigating the Supreme Court leak is now requesting employee phone records, but unlike like January 6 detainees this is not part of a grand jury investigation. However, Nancy Pelosi's select committee will offer all its discovery to the Department of Justice for a criminal investigation seeking to indict former President Trump on whatever bogus charge they can make stick. No committee of Congress has the authority to conduct research for a criminal investigation, yet they are doing it. This Committee has never asked Pelosi for her Testimony or phone records regarding January 6th despite her influence over the Capitol Police in her role as Speaker. Later, Democrats don't believe in law order. They don't put criminals in jail, they defund the police, and eliminate cash bail keeping criminals on the street. Are Americans supposed to trust Democrats on gun control? Biden says making schools a harder target is not necessary, what's necessary is going after handguns like the 9mm pistol (not even the AR-15). \nLearn more about your ad choices.
