  "description": "On Tuesday’s Mark Levin Show, the debate over wanting Donald Trump's virtue over his vices is flawed logic and it doesn't get very far. Trump was born for this struggle against the woke communists says Clairmont institute Chairman Tom Klingenstein. Adding that we are in the midst of a cold civil war, Trump highlighted the existing divide and the left's desire to end America as we know it. It's precisely Trump's unorthodox virtue and bravado that makes him tick and succeed. The bottom line is that we must not back down or compromise our values, we must stand proudly for what we support and believe. Then, this upcoming election is about those that love the country, its principles and history, and those that hate the country. There are Americans that hate faith, the nuclear family, our national sovereignty, and our military. It's between those that love America and those that hate America, that's it. That is the choice. Later, David Limbaugh joins the show to discuss his new book,\" The Resurrected Jesus: The Church in the New Testament.\" David dedicated this new book, co-authored with his daughter Christen Limbaugh Bloom, to his brother Rush's fans. Every sentence in the book focuses on the mind, body, and soul. \n https://www.amazon.com/Resurrected-Jesus-David-Limbaugh/dp/1621579891/ref=sr_1_2?crid=CTP586S00QLJ&keywords=david+limbaugh&qid=1662469092&sprefix=david+limbaugh%2Caps%2C81&sr=8-2\nLearn more about your ad choices.
