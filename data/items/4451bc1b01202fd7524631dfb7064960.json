A college student in Provo, Utah, says he's hearing this expression of sarcastic incredulity more and more—even catching himself saying this to his cellphone when it dropped a call.

Here's a great example of that show's use of the expression. A Connecticut cop says his dad, a retired professor of English and comparative literature at Yale, has been reading his son's police reports. They disagree about whether \"complainant\" is a legitimate word, or whether it should be \"complainer.\"Here's a riddle: \"I'm weightless, but you can see me.
