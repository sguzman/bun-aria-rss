  "title": "Episode 98: Desmond Bane",
  "description": "We've seen the story before right? An underrated player comes out of college, somehow hits another level in the pros, and then surprises everyone en route to becoming an NBA star. But what about the guy who hardly got a sniff in the recruiting game coming out of HIGH SCHOOL? Quite simply, that basketball story usually ends right there. Well, don't tell that to Desmond Bane, because getting overlooked coming out of high school only lit his fire to succeed even more. After paving his way through a solid career at TCU, he has taken the proverbial 'next level' leap in the NBA and has become a bonafide force for the Memphis Grizzlies. Teaming with Ja Morant and company, they've got the Grizzlies well on their way to creating some major havoc in the playoffs. Listen in as Desmond discusses his rise to the top, his struggles with the recruiting game, how his body type is the antithesis of the typical NBA shooter, whether or not he believes the Grizzlies can win a chip this season, and so much more. \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\nLearn more about your ad choices.
