  "description": "<p>Happy 2022! I am thinking about new things I can do with this podcast. Is it: more episodes? More mini episodes? A rotating small cast of recurring guest hosts? Call in episodes? Having listeners on the show? Weirdly, a lot of people said I should do some solo episodes talking about a product or two each week. I am super down for that, but it also makes me extremely nervous! So I called my friend Kate Kennedy of Be There In Five and asked her if she’d share some solo podcasting tips with me. I remain still overwhelmed but less overwhelmed than before!&nbsp;</p><br><p>If you missed my episode of Be There In Five, listen here: <a href=\"https://bethereinfive.com/podcast/2021/12/18/why-buy-the-cowl-with-caroline-moss\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://bethereinfive.com/podcast/2021/12/18/why-buy-the-cowl-with-caroline-moss</a>&nbsp;</p><br><p>And Kate’s prior episode of Gee Thanks!: <a href=\"https://play.acast.com/s/geethanksjustboughtit/ep90-bravo-bravo-bravowithkatekennedy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://play.acast.com/s/geethanksjustboughtit/ep90-bravo-bravo-bravowithkatekennedy</a>&nbsp;</p><br><p><strong>Gee Thanks! is powered by subscribers like you!
