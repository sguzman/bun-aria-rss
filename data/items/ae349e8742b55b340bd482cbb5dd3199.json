  "description": "<div>On this week’s Book Club podcast we’re talking about the best crime writer you’ve (probably) never heard of. As Penguin reissues three of Josephine Tey’s classic <em>Golden Age</em> novels, I’m joined by Nicola Upson, whose own detective stories (most recently <em>Dear Little Corpses</em>) feature Tey as a central character. She tells me about the unique character of Tey’s writing, her discreet private life, and about how she made possible the psychological crime fiction that we read now.</div>\n",
