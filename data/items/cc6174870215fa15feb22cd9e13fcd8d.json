  "title": "Jest Mocks?Unit Testing for EdgeWorkers",
  "description": "In case you haven?t already been working with EdgeWorkers, it allows you to run JavaScript code across more than 4,200 locations for proximity to users and fast application response times. \nWith more and more application functionality moving to the edge, it?s increasingly important to ensure that each function is doing what it needs to do. A unit test runs code over each segment of your program, checking the input and output. These tests allow developers to check individual areas of a program to see where (and why) errors are occurring. Several frameworks allow you to easily run your tests, including popular frameworks like Jest, Mocha, Jasmine, and Cypress.",
