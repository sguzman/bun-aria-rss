  "description": "<p>Born in New York City, Pema Chödrön is one of the first Western women to be fully ordained as a Tibetan Buddhist nun. Pema explains how difficult times can be an opportunity for growth and change if you're willing to embrace the situation and the feelings that come with it. One of the basic Buddhist tenets, Pema says, is that change is constant. \"Things are going to keep changing,\" she says. \"If you're invested in security and certainty, then you're not going to feel good a lot of the time.\"</p>\n",
