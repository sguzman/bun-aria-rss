  "description": "<p>In this short note, I outline conditions under which conditioning on\nSynthetic Control (SC) weights emulates a randomized control trial where the\ntreatment status is independent of potential outcomes. Specifically, I\ndemonstrate that if there exist SC weights such that (i) the treatment effects\nare exactly identified and (ii) these weights are uniformly and cumulatively\nbounded, then SC weights are balancing scores.\n</p>",
