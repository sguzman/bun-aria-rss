  "description": "Clay flies solo Friday. Biden's apocalyptic speech: \"You can't love your country only when you win.\" \"FJB\" chants erupt in Philly as Joe Biden delivers fascist speech. He always says how much Trump was trying to be a dictator, yet Biden appeared with Marines standing behind him. Clay says, \"Every time Joe Biden opens his mouth, he is the best advocate for Republicans anywhere in the country today.\" Three easy steps to stay out of poverty: Finish high school, don't have a kid until after 25 and stay married -- after not marrying too young. Clay advises the many teachers in the audience to pass along that data-driven statement. Democrats' strategy for the midterms is to put Donald Trump on the ballot. Biden thinks America today is like when it was in 1860 or 1940. If it wasn't for covid, Biden wouldn't have been elected. Biden is an accidental president.<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
