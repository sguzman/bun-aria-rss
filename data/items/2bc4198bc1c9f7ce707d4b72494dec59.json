  "description": "<p>There’s more to sloths than slowness. They’re great at saving energy, hanging upside down, and swimming! In this episode, Sloth Appreciation Society founder Lucy Cooke stops by to tell us all about these amazing animals. We also get into a sloth mystery: The Case of the Perilous Poop Journey. Luckily, there’s a sloth sleuth on the case. And sloths aren’t the only animals who aren’t in a hurry — a few others show off their slowest skills.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>There’s also a Mystery Sound for you to guess, and a Moment of Um: Why do ostriches stick their heads in the ground?</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This episode was sponsored by:</p>\n<p>Mathnasium (<a href=\"http://mathnasium.com/\" class=\"default\">mathnasium.com</a>)</p>\n<p>KiwiCo (<a href=\"http://kiwico.com/\" class=\"default\">kiwico.com</a> Promo code: BRAINSON)</p>\n",
