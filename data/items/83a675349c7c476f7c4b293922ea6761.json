More companies are kickstarting digital transformations to keep up with their tech-savvy competitors and meet the needs of their digitally-driven customers.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, making a companywide transition to the cloud might seem intimidating, particularly for organisations that still rely on legacy systems. Before small businesses migrate to the cloud, they should consider several important factors, including cost, availability, security and availability.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are the benefits of migrating to the cloud and some tips to keep in mind to make the process simple and effective: </span></p>\n<h1>Five benefits of cloud migration for businesses</h1>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cloud computing for enterprises involves </span><a rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://www.thesmbguide.com/cloud-services\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">running cloud-based application software</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> on various servers across the internet. More businesses are using the cloud than ever before.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Research shows that </span><a rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://www.statista.com/statistics/1062879/worldwide-cloud-storage-of-corporate-data/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">over 60 per cent of all corporate data</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> is stored in the cloud, and that figure will rise in the coming years. One reason the cloud will become more ubiquitous in business is the widespread remote work trend. More people are working at home due to the COVID-19 pandemic, so companies need cloud technology to support their employees.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Also Read: <a rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://e27.co/cloud-communications-firm-toku-nets-us5m-series-a-20221026/\">Cloud communications firm Toku nets US$5M Series A+ for APAC expansion</a></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Below are some primary benefits businesses can reap from migrating to the cloud:</span></p>\n<p><strong>Data accessibility</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cloud services allow users to access these applications from any location with internet access, which helps businesses with remote workers. Because the cloud </span><a rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://www.pcmag.com/how-to/what-is-cloud-computing\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">transmits data over the internet</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, there&#8217;s no need for employees to work near physical hardware in an office. Anyone with proper credentials can access the company cloud, a centralised, web-based information hub. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Scalability</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Modern businesses need digital solutions that can scale up or down, depending on needs. For example, companies using the cloud can adjust the number of users if new employees join the team or others resign. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Cost-effectiveness</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The most popular cloud service providers, such as Amazon Web Services (AWS), Microsoft Azure and Google Cloud Platform (GCP), offer a pay-as-you-go model. These subscriptions allow companies to only </span><a rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://www.techtarget.com/searchstorage/definition/pay-as-you-go-cloud-computing-PAYG-cloud-computing\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">pay for essential services</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, which helps reduce unnecessary expenses. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Security</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">A significant benefit of using the cloud is enhanced security. Cybersecurity must be a priority for virtually every company. Therefore, organisations should invest in solutions that will protect their sensitive data. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">However, no IT environment is completely secure in today&#8217;s cybersecurity landscape. More businesses are moving to the cloud, and it&#8217;s becoming </span><a rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://rehack.com/security/it-security-trends/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">an increasingly popular target</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> for hackers. The cloud is highly secure, but companies must utilise other preventive security measures to protect themselves.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Business continuity</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Another benefit of using the cloud is business continuity. The cloud will come in handy if an organisation experiences a disaster, such as a cyberattack or hardware failure. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cloud computing solutions offer suitable storage options for companies in an emergency. Their IT systems are usually accessible from remote locations </span><a rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://www.techopedia.com/why-your-business-continuity-plan-should-include-the-cloud/2/34731\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">to keep operations running</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> smoothly.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">While this is not an exhaustive list, it does provide a glimpse into how businesses can benefit from the cloud. </span></p>\n<h2>Tips for a seamless migration to the cloud</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Follow some of these helpful tips to ensure your cloud migration process is successful:</span></p>\n<p><strong>Assess company needs</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Before your company moves to the cloud, it&#8217;s important to identify why the transition is necessary, who will be affected by the change, a reasonable budget and other important considerations. </span></p>\n<p><a rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://techbeacon.com/enterprise-it/5-tips-tackling-cloud-migration\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider using the 80/20 rule</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> when planning the migration: 80 per cent of your data will migrate easily, and 20 per cent might pose challenges. The 20 per cent is also referred to as &#8220;anchor workloads,&#8221; which are crucial to operations, create a complex IT infrastructure and are costly. Take them into account when planning your strategy.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Consider a piecemeal transition</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some organisations are eager to leverage the cloud and, as a result, transfer all their processes there. However, this could overwhelm your employees and cause more harm than good. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Also Read: <a rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://e27.co/how-can-businesses-improve-their-operating-margin-by-controlling-cloud-costs-20221004/\">How can businesses improve their operating margin by controlling cloud costs</a></strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Consider </span><a rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://bluesentry.cloud/blog/common-mistakes-to-avoid-when-migrating-to-the-cloud/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">migrating to the cloud over time</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and train your employees to get a feel for the new IT landscape. A slow transition approach will help the company adjust and fix any possible issues.</span></p>\n<p><strong>Outline roles and responsibilities</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Migrating to the cloud might alter some of your employee&#8217;s roles and responsibilities. Keep them updated on these changes and what your departments should expect. All workers should be aware of the cloud migration and be ready to communicate during the process.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Your company&#8217;s IT department will play a significant role in the transition. IT professionals with experience in cloud tech will make a move easier. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Choose a migration partner</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many cloud service providers offer helpful migration services for companies. These vendors know that more clients need assistance moving to the cloud, so they offer expert support to help facilitate the transition. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Here are some of the </span><a rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://www.channelinsider.com/cloud-computing/cloud-migration-services-providers/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">most popular vendors with cloud migration</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> services:</span></p>\n<ul>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Accenture</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cognizant</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">AWS</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Infosys</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">IBM Managed Cloud Services</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Google Cloud</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Deloitte</span></li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">These organisations and others simplify cloud migration to ensure the process is successful. </span></p>\n<p><strong>Test, monitor and train</strong></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Once the company successfully migrates to the cloud, it&#8217;s important to run tests, monitor the new system and train employees on how to navigate the new environment. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">It might be challenging, particularly if seasoned employees are less tech-savvy than their younger peers. Employees must learn to leverage the cloud to fulfil their job responsibilities and contribute to the organisation.</span></p>\n<h2>Simplify cloud migration for your small business</h2>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The business landscape is rapidly changing. Companies must be agile, flexible and willing to adopt new technologies to align with their specific business objectives. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Cloud technology is becoming increasingly widespread for all types and sizes of businesses. Migrating to the cloud will benefit your company, but only if the process is successful.</span></p>\n<p>&#8211;</p>\n<p>Editor’s note: <b >e27</b> aims to foster thought leadership by publishing views from the community.
