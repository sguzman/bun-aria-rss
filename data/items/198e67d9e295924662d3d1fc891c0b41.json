  "description": "On Thursday’s Mark Levin Show, Ben Ferguson fills in for Mark. The media has shown how low they’ve gotten by using the funeral of George H.W. Bush to attack President Trump. Covering a Presidential funeral is the easiest story to cover; it’s a non-political political event where you honor the person, yet the media can’t even do that right. Trump did everything right at the funeral and never made it about him, yet the media finds ways to attack him by criticizing his body language. No matter what it is, the left and the media always feels the need to connect it to Trump so they can use it to attack him, all because they still can’t get over the fact that he’s president and doing amazing things for our country. Also, a father is being called a child abuser for punishing his daughter for bullying by making her walk five miles. This is good all-American parenting, and snowflake crybaby parents who don’t discipline their children are doing them more harm than good.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
