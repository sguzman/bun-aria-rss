  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, Marxism is traitorous. Tyranny is here and it's staring us in the face. Nancy Pelosi says that the Confederate Generals were traitors for seeking to destroy and divide our country. If that is so, isn't Marxism traitorous? Haven't the Marxists made it clear that their movements like ANTIFA, Black Lives Matter, and the Democrat Party are all traitors based on Pelosi's logic. Statues and flags aren't destroying professional sports, ruining major cities, attacking cops, and destroying schools. Then, this election will determine if the press is consequential or not. The left in the media are spreading a separatist message that weakens America from within. Just like the flat-earth Democrats, the government bureaucrats don't complain because they enjoy public sector largesse and continue getting paid while the private sector is shut down and the rest of America is hurting economically. Later, this program calls for a defund movement for colleges and universities that are indoctrinating America's youth. Biden and the teacher's unions push to keep kids out of school despite the scientific evidence proving their risk is minimal. Afterward, Dr. Manny Sethi, a candidate for the US Senate in Tennessee calls in to discuss the campaign.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
