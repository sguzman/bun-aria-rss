  "description": "Today we have Colton Broadbent, one of our favorite architectural designers with whom we’ve done quite a bit of work lately. We talk about the importance of the architect and what role they play in the whole design process where the architect is like the surgeon. We talk about what to look for in an architect, such as someone who will provide share-ables to you, and then look for someone that you get along with because often you’re going to be working with your architect for a couple of years. Colton tells us what goes into working with unique terrain such as putting a home on a mountain side, or working with a river that runs through a property. We emphasize the importance of putting together a team that you get along with from the beginning to have the right flow in order to get optimal results. We also go over how to talk about and bring up budgets with the client and the best ways to work a budget into a project.<br /><br />What to look for in an architect 3:47<br />Working with unique terrain 15:15<br />Decorators vs designers 27:20<br />Order of operations for setting up the team 30:11<br />Everything we wish a client had before working on a home 32:47<br />Tip for our listeners 37:50<br />How to talk about budgets and be realistic about costs 40:22<br />Budgets that Colton works with 50:42<br /><br />“My job as the architect is to either get them a great interior designer, or a lot of times these guys will bring work my way, and so we’ll work together to program the house.
