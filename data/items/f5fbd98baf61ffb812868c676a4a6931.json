  "description": "Today we want to talk about how we like to make our homes feel cozy during these winter months and our favorite layers we like to use to make our homes feel warm and inviting. There are so many warm and welcoming colors to add to your porch, such as pumpkins and velvety plants to match the season. This is the time of year you’re going to get a lot of guests and visitors, so filling up your porch with fun decorations and accessories is a great way to give your home that welcoming, warm touch. We recommend keeping some snips nearby and your eyes open during this season in case you spot some nice yew, or other similar plants to take from nature and enhance not just the visuals in your home, but the smells as well. <br /><br />The porch 1:58<br />The entry 6:46<br />Entry hall table 13:10<br />Layers 15:33<br />Winter or Fall bed 22:08<br /><br />“So that entry hall table, I always have some large books as well. Books that can be seasonal, like some entertaining books. I’ve got one on entertaining and the cover is like a silk, and it’s got this beautiful scene on it, and those warm earth tones look so good, especially at this time of year.” 13:11<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
