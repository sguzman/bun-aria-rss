  "description": "With the recent onslaught of ransomware attacks across healthcare institutions, critical infrastructure, and the public sector, it's clear that ransomware isn’t going anywhere. But given how common ransomware attacks have become, how is it that we've been unable to put a stop to them? Companies often overlook the role that hardware security plays in meeting this challenge, and that oversight has become a bad actor's dream. Michael Nordquist speaks about the recent surge in ransomware attacks, and how strong hardware security, combined with software security and personnel security awareness, can be the answer to the industry’s prayers.\nIn this episode of CyberWire-X, guest Steve Winterfeld from Akamai shares his insights with the CyberWire's Rick Howard, and Michael Nordquist of sponsor Intel offers his thoughts to the CyberWire's Dave Bittner.",
