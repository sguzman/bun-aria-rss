  "description": "<p>In part two of Don’t Just Communicate, Connect, John Maxwell shares the final disconnect he experienced early in his leadership journey that kept him from connecting with those he led. John then closes the lesson by sharing what he does well when it comes to connecting with people. These include valuing others, living with integrity, and simplifying his message.</p> <p>Mark Cole and Chris Goede reveal the importance of having tough conversations in a timely manner. They show how squandered opportunities to have hard conversations may jeopardize more than what you think is at stake.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this series is the Don’t Just Communicate, Connect Worksheet, which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching. You can download the worksheet by visiting MaxwellPodcast.com/Connecting and clicking “Download the Bonus Resource.”</p> <p>References:</p> <p><a href= \"https://store.johnmaxwell.com/Everyone-Communicates-Few-Connect-Hardcover_p_2783.html\"> <em>Everyone Communicates, Few Connect</em> by John C.
