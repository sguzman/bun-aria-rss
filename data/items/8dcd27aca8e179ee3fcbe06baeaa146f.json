A soap box for Independent Ideas, current events and politics of the day.\n\nThe government is facing a shutdown, but the reason is not because we are running out of money, or we are facing a future as seen in the televison series \"Designated Survivor\", no its because one party is holding 327 million people hostage to benefit 3.5 million people that are here without our permission. To make matters worse, and yes they can be worse, California is taking action openly hostile to the Federal Government that hasn't been seen since the Civil War. Toss in the conversation that California is looking to split in two and we've got a crockpot of headaches, and a chili of disaster on the menu. \n\nTune in as we discuss the matters of the day, that could be a bit longer. \n\nJoin me at 1030am Pacific, when I open up the lines, and discuss these and much more.\n\nTrigger Warning; I'm not intending to be Politically Correct.",
