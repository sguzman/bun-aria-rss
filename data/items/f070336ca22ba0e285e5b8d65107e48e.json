  "description": "<p>Welp, throw “Killer Legends” on the stacks of Halloween-ey docs we’ve hated!</p>\n\n\n<p>Having skimmed the Wikipedia pages and doing a combined 14 minutes of research, filmmakers Josh and Rachel head off to discover ‘the truth behind four of our most terrifying urban legends’….or whatever. Josh is overeager, Rachel is over Josh, and the city of Chicago is over the both of these fools asking if anyone is afraid of clowns. But hey, Donahue makes a hilariously morbid cameo, so it was all worth it. </p>\n\n\n<p><strong>LOOKING FOR MORE TCO?</strong> <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/TrueCrimeObsessed\">Check out our bonus episodes on Patreon!</a> We covered <strong>\"Serial\"</strong> episode-by-episode and capped the series off with an interview with <strong>Rabia Chaudry</strong>--Adnan's friend who brought his story to Sarah Koenig AND with <strong>Asia Mcclain</strong>--Adnan's alibi witness!
