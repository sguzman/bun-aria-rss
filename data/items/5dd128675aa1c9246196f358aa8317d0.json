  "description": "<div>\n<strong>Here’s a preview of Bad Women: The Blackout Ripper.</strong> <br>\n<br>\nOver a single week in February 1942, a depraved serial killer stalked London’s dark and WWII bomb-ravaged streets, hunting for victims in the city’s bars and clubs. But the victims of the so-called Blackout Ripper are now all but forgotten. <br>\n<br>\nUsing new research from police files, court transcripts and exhaustive genealogical studies, season 2 of Hallie Rubenhold’s Bad Women reconstructs the lives of the women The Blackout Ripper brutally attacked and murdered and examines why their deaths were swept from view. <br>\n<br>\nListen to Bad Women at <a href=\"https://podcasts.pushkin.fm/bwblackout?sid=uk%20\">https://podcasts.pushkin.fm/bwblackout?sid=uk </a>\n</div>\n",
