  "description": "<p>Today's guest is Steve Horwitz, he is the Charles A. Dana Professor and Chair of the economics department at St. Lawrence University.</p> <p>Steve recently wrote an article titled, <a href= \"https://fee.org/articles/make-babies-and-don-t-let-the-greens-guilt-trip-you-about-it/\" target=\"_blank\">\"Make Babies, and Don't Let the Greens Guilt Trip You about It.\"</a> This was a response to an argument made by the bioethicist Travis Rieder, who was recently <a href= \"http://www.npr.org/2016/08/18/479349760/should-we-be-having-kids-in-the-age-of-climate-change\" target=\"_blank\">profiled by NPR</a>. Rieder argues that it is immoral to have children because of the burden additional humans place on the Earth, in particular because of the risk of catastrophic climate change. Here's how that NPR piece put his argument:</p> <blockquote>\"Back at James Madison University, Travis Rieder explains a PowerPoint graph that seems to offer hope. Bringing down global fertility by just half a child per woman 'could be the thing that saves us,' he says. He cites <a href= \"http://www.pnas.org/content/107/41/17521.full\" target=\"_blank\">a study from 2010</a> that looked at the impact of demographic change on global carbon emissions. It found that slowing population growth could eliminate one-fifth to one-quarter of all the carbon emissions that need to be cut by midcentury to avoid that potentially catastrophic tipping point.\"</blockquote> <p>The problem with this sort of reasoning is that it views human beings as consumers and not as producers and innovators. Humans are able to contribute to the division of labour and to come up with ideas. That division of labour allows everyone to become more productive.</p> <p>Rieder's ideas echo those of <a href= \"http://www.econlib.org/library/Enc/bios/Malthus.html\" target= \"_blank\">Thomas Robert Malthus</a>, and he is wrong for much the same reasons. Malthus anticipated a world where the diminishing returns in agriculture and exponential population growth would lead humanity to subsistence in a few generations. As Malthus predicted, populations did skyrocket, but contra Malthus, people got significantly richer too. What happened?</p> <p>Innovation happened. Along with that innovation, and contributing to it, was a finer division of labour created by population growth. As <a href= \"http://www.econlib.org/library/Smith/smWN1.html\" target= \"_blank\">Adam Smith wrote</a>, \"the division of labour is limited by the extent of the market.\"</p> <div style=\"float: right; margin-left: 10px;\"><a href= \"https://www.amazon.com/Ultimate-Resource-Julian-Lincoln-Simon/dp/0691003815/ref=as_li_ss_il?ie=UTF8&qid=1473958034&sr=8-2&keywords=the+ultimate+resource&linkCode=li2&tag=economicsdete-20&linkId=1228128d85146e402c7f4295d4b2a331\" target=\"_blank\"><img src= \"//ws-na.amazon-adsystem.com/widgets/q?_encoding=UTF8&ASIN=0691003815&Format=_SL160_&ID=AsinImage&MarketPlace=US&ServiceVersion=20070822&WS=1&tag=economicsdete-20\" alt=\"\" border=\"0\" /></a><img style= \"border: none !important; margin: 0px !important;\" src= \"https://ir-na.amazon-adsystem.com/e/ir?t=economicsdete-20&l=li2&o=1&a=0691003815\" alt=\"\" width=\"1\" height=\"1\" border=\"0\" /></div> <p>Humans create resources, not by violating thermodynamics, but by discovering better ways to satisfy our needs with the physical matter that exists.
