  "description": "<p>Jason Haas is a Partner and the General Manager of <a href= \"https://tablascreek.com/\">Tablas Creek Vineyard</a>. His late father, Robert Haas was a renowned importer who partnered with Château de Beaucastel in Châteauneuf-du-Pape to scout a perfect site to grow Rhône varieties in California. They found it in the Adelaida District of Paso Robles and built one of the best wineries in California.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://tablascreek.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/Tablas-Creek-Proprietor-Jason-Haas.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"400\" /><em><span style= \"font-size: 8pt;\">Jason Haas of Tablas Creek.

His clear and educational writing has been published in many wine publications as well as the award-winning <a href=\"http://tablascreek.typepad.com/\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Tablas Creek blog</a>. </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>Jason is a big advocate for Paso Robles but also a passionate champion of more sustainable, earth-friendly solutions in the wine industry. He is a pioneer of the regenerative organic viticulture program in California, which we will discuss, and he is the first premium winery in California to put his wine in the sustainable 3 liter bag in box. This is Jason’s third appearance on the show and this time he updates us on all the work that he and <a href= \"https://tablascreek.com/\">Tablas Creek</a> have done to push forward in making their vineyard and winery ever more gentle on the environment. They are leaders in California and in global thinking in wine and they are forging a path for the others to reduce their impact on the earth in wine.
