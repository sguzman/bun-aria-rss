  "title": "285 - How (Not) To Read Your Bible - with Dan Kimball",
  "description": "There is a saying that states that “The fastest way to become an atheist is to read the Bible.” In many circles, the conundrum that is the Bible has become a stumbling block for Christians and non-Christians alike. How do you reconcile things like violence and slavery inside? How do you approach a text written so long ago, to societies so unlike ours? Is the Bible outdated and harmful? How does one reconcile the odd and disturbing things within? Is the Bible the “Good Book?” Is it authoritative and what does that even mean?\n\nToday, we sit down with author and Pastor Dan Kimball to discuss his new book, “How (Not) To Read The Bible.” Dan talks to us about approaches and understandings that are needed before you open the text. The Bible can be confusing and challenging… \n\nYou can pre-order Dan’s book at: https://www.dankimball.com/how-not-to-read-the-bible\nFollow Dan on social media: @dankimball\n\nAs always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
