The skies of perception part. Blanketed in awe, we’re compelled to re-evaluate our own personal capabilities.

Under nothing but his own power, Colin pulled a 300lb sled 932 miles in just 54 days across the coldest, windiest, most remote continent on earth from the Atlantic to the Pacific via the South Pole.</p><br><p>Colin first appeared on the podcast in December&nbsp;of 2015 (<a href=\"https://www.richroll.com/podcast/colin-obrady/\" target=\"_blank\">RRP 207</a>) — a deep dive into his unique&nbsp;upbringing on a commune; how he survived an almost lethal burn accident that left him unlikely to walk again; his phoenix like transformation into a professional ITU triathlete and Olympic hopeful; and how he morphed into a mountaineer with the audacity to attempt incomprehensible feats of adventure athleticism.</p><p>After conquering the Explorer’s Grand Slam, a&nbsp;challenge that encompassed scaling the highest mountain on each of the seven continents&nbsp;and&nbsp;treks to both the North and South Poles, Colin returned to the podcast in June of 2016 (<a href=\"https://www.richroll.com/podcast/colin-obrady-2/\" target=\"_blank\">RRP 235</a>).&nbsp;Among the 44 who have completed the EGS, only 2 have done it under a year. Not only was Colin the youngest person to successfully complete this most prestigious undertaking,&nbsp;he crushed&nbsp;the world record by a stunning 53-day margin, completing it in a mere 139 days. Along the way, he simultaneously broke the&nbsp;7 Summits&nbsp;world record by two days.</p><p>Today he returns to share his most remarkable achievement to date, a&nbsp;freeze solo&nbsp;adventure he dubbed the <a href=\"https://www.colinobrady.com/theimpossiblefirst\" target=\"_blank\">Impossible First.</a>&nbsp;It’s a jaw-dropping story you might have seen unfold in real time on Colin’s Instagram (<a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/colinobrady/\" target=\"_blank\">@colinobrady</a>) or in the stellar 360-degree&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/interactive/2018/12/18/sports/antarctica-race-tracker-map.html\" target=\"_blank\">New York Times coverage</a> penned by my friend (<a href=\"https://www.richroll.com/podcast/adam-skolnick/\" target=\"_blank\">and former podcast guest</a>) Adam Skolnick.</p><p>Uncovering the&nbsp;why behind the expedition, we explore how he dealt with the gear, solitude, -80F temps, and 30 mph headwinds.
