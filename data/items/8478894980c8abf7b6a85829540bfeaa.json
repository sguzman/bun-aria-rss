When you love your self you treat yourself as such.” [4:13]   “That relentless, ‘nothing’s going to stop me,’ when you use that power, that’s just as beautiful as the smile” [12:50]   “I can’t tell people to be fearless and look past their insecurities if I don’t do the same.” [28:35]   “If you practice honesty with yourself, that’s who you are, and you’ll naturally become that for everyone else.” [29:45]   “We are always trying to get better, you never land on betterment. We’re never always great.” [31:23]   “Even though you may know, you may know a lot.
