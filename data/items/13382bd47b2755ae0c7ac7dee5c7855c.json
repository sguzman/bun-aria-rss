  "description": "Light is a comfort to us. We’re forever reaching for the light switch first because if you can see it, you know what to fight, right?

And finally, the final light speaks in classic creepypasta “Gateway of The Mind”\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
