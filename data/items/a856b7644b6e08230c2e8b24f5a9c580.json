  "description": "<p>Partial differential equations (PDEs) are often computationally challenging\nto solve, and in many settings many related PDEs must be be solved either at\nevery timestep or for a variety of candidate boundary conditions, parameters,\nor geometric domains. We present a meta-learning based method which learns to\nrapidly solve problems from a distribution of related PDEs. We use\nmeta-learning (MAML and LEAP) to identify initializations for a neural network\nrepresentation of the PDE solution such that a residual of the PDE can be\nquickly minimized on a novel task. We apply our meta-solving approach to a\nnonlinear Poisson's equation, 1D Burgers' equation, and hyperelasticity\nequations with varying parameters, geometries, and boundary conditions. The\nresulting Meta-PDE method finds qualitatively accurate solutions to most\nproblems within a few gradient steps; for the nonlinear Poisson and\nhyper-elasticity equation this results in an intermediate accuracy\napproximation up to an order of magnitude faster than a baseline finite element\nanalysis (FEA) solver with equivalent accuracy. In comparison to other learned\nsolvers and surrogate models, this meta-learning approach can be trained\nwithout supervision from expensive ground-truth data, does not require a mesh,\nand can even be used when the geometry and topology varies between tasks.\n</p>",
