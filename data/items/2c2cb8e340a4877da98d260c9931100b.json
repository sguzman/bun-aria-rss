  "description": "<p>Richard Sherman reacts to Week 5 in the NFL, including the 49ers costly win over Baker Mayfield's Carolina Panthers with injuries to Nick Bosa, Jimmie Ward, and Emmanuel Moseley. What does Richard think of the Seattle Seahawks loss to the New Orleans Saints despite Geno Smith's great performance? The Dallas Cowboys might have a controversy, but it's not Dak Prescott vs. Cooper Rush – it's with Ezekiel Elliott and Tony Pollard. Finally, Richard gives his thoughts on the Pittsburgh Steelers suffering their worst loss in 33 years to Josh Allen & the Buffalo Bills in Kenny Pickett's first career start. #volume #herd #ColinCowherd</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
