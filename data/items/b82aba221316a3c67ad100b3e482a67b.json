  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, President Biden has attacked every aspect of American productivity from fertilizer to energy production. Democrat policies have killed jobs and increased the cost of goods. Inflation is out of control at a 40-year high and despite the manipulated calculations, when the GDP comes in, we’ll likely will see that the U.S is in a recession. Then, what would Donald Trump do to resolve these shortages? Trump would be on the phone with manufacturers, foreign leaders, and government agencies to roll back red tape. Yet, Biden blames everyone for our misfortune and praises himself for doing a good job. Later, China screwed us with the pandemic and Democrat Governors set the stage for Marxism at all costs to stop Trump while Marc Elias spearheaded legal challenges to circumvent constitutional election law. Churches, synagogues, and mosques were closed, and abortion clinics were allowed to stay open. BLM rioters looted our cities while barbershops were shut down. In breaking news, Rep's. Jim Jordan and Mike Johnson released a letter regarding the FBI's tracking and labeling of dozens of parents as insurrectionists. Following the infamous Merrick Garland memo last October, written at the behest of the National School Boards Association, whistleblowers have revealed that the domestic terrorism division of the FBI has used a tip line and threat tags to target concerned parents. This impedes a parent's Constitutional right to speak and advocate for their children. Afterward, US Senate Candidate Dave McCormick calls in to discuss his campaign. McCormick added how he will challenge his Democrat opponent in the general election. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
