  "description": "On today's show, Pat breaks down his trip to New York City for his appearance on Get Up, and dives into everything he ran into while in the Big Apple including his hotel room and travel issues, why his Uber driver had a big problem with Chinatown, and why he can never buy any of the knockoff items that the vendors sell there. Pat and the guys also discuss a wide range of topics including a new weight loss challenge starting on New Years Day between a couple of the guys in the office, they talk about what's going on in the NBA thus far this year and whether or not Kevin Durant is leaving the Warriors, chat a little more about the For The Brand brand, and break down some things floating around the NFL while also looking ahead to tonight's Thursday Night Football matchup featuring the Saints and the Cowboys. It's a great time. Come and laugh with us, cheers.\n",
