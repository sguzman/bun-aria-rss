  "description": "<p>When he was nine years old in 1872, Black Elk, a member of the Lakota tribe, had a near-death vision in which he was called to save not only his people but all of humanity. For the rest of his life, Black Elk's vision haunted and inspired him as he took part in many of the seminal confrontations between the Lakota and the U.S. government, including those at Little Bighorn and Wounded Knee. </p>\n<p>My guest today is the author of a biography of this native holy man. His name is <a href=\"joejacksonbooks.com\">Joe Jackson</a> and his book is <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/1250141257/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=1250141257&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>Black Elk: The Life of an American Visionary</em></a>. We begin our conversation with a background of the Sioux or Lakota Indians, including how the introduction of the horse turned them into formidable hunters and warriors and how their spirituality influenced their warfare. Joe then introduces us to Black Elk and unfolds the vision that he had as a boy which would lead him to follow in his family's footsteps by becoming a medicine man and guide him for the rest of his life. We then take detours into the seminal battles between the U.S government and the Lakota that Black Elk witnessed firsthand, as well as the Sun Dance and Ghost Dance rituals which helped catalyze them. Joe then explains why Black Elk converted to Catholicism after the Indian Wars and how he fused Lakota spirituality with his newfound faith. We then discuss why Black Elk decided to tell his vision to a white poet named John Neihardt and the cultural influence the resulting book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/0803283911/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=0803283911&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\"><em>Black Elk Speaks</em></a>, had on the West in the 20th century. We end our conversation discussing whether Black Elk ever felt he fulfilled his vision. </p>\n<p>Get the show notes at <a href=\"aom.is/blackelk\">aom.is/blackelk</a>.</p>\n",
