  "description": "Brick by brick the Trump team is not building a wall, it's dismantling the international order.  The latest move--an attack on the International Criminal Court by National Security Advisor John Bolton.  Should you care?  Isn't this just an inside baseball attack on some other acronym that probably doesn't work that well to begin with?  Or is it a signal of something more, something bigger, maybe even a watershed in international history?  To answer the question we hear from IISS's Kori Schake, Georgetown University's Rosa Brooks and Third Way's Mieke Eoyang.  Tune in for all that...and much more about Israel, Afghanistan, America, and bugbears.Support this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
