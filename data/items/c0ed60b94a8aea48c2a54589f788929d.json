  "description": "<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>We&#8217;re keeping an eye on Tesla after Elon Musk reached a deal to buy Twitter earlier this week. Musk has sold roughly $8.5 billion worth of Tesla shares in the last couple of days. We&#8217;ll get a little into the weeds about the dynamics playing out as the Twitter deal closes. Plus, the fallout after the Jan. 6 insurrection continues — we&#8217;ll update you on what&#8217;s happening in the courts. And a COVID-19 vaccine for young kids may be on the way. Then, the hosts play a round of Half Full/Half Empty. Finally, a big thank you to producer Marque Greene for all his hard work as he wraps up his stint on &#8220;Make Me Smart.&#8221; But don&#8217;t worry, he&#8217;s not going far.</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Here&#8217;s everything we talked about today:</p>\n<p><!-- /wp:paragraph --> <!-- wp:list --></p>\n<ul>\n<li>&#8220;<a href=\"https://www.politico.com/news/2022/04/29/second-oath-keeper-pleads-to-seditious-conspiracy-00028982\">Second Oath Keeper pleads to seditious conspiracy</a>&#8221; from Politico</li>\n<li>&#8220;<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/04/29/politics/hannity-text-messages-meadows-trump-white-house/index.html\">CNN Exclusive: New text messages reveal Fox&#8217;s Hannity advising Trump White House and seeking direction</a>&#8221; from CNN</li>\n<li>&#8220;<a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/elon-musk-sells-billions-of-dollars-in-tesla-stock-11651197227?mod=business_lead_pos1\">Elon Musk Sells $8.5 Billion of Tesla Shares After Deal to Buy Twitter</a>&#8221; from The Wall Street Journal</li>\n<li>&#8220;<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/29/podcasts/the-daily/ukraine-russia-war-us.html\">The Risks of a New U.S. Approach in Ukraine</a>&#8221; from &#8220;The Daily&#8221;</li>\n<li>&#8220;<a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/health-shots/2022/04/28/1095052893/moderna-asks-fda-to-authorize-first-covid-19-vaccine-for-very-young-children\">Moderna asks FDA to authorize first COVID-19 vaccine for very young children</a>&#8221; from NPR</li>\n</ul>\n<p><!-- /wp:list --> <!-- wp:paragraph --></p>\n<p>Tell us what you think about today’s show.
