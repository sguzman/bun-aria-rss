  "description": "<p>In June of 2003, college basketball star Patrick Dennehy vanished. For weeks leading up to the disappearance, Patrick had complained to friends, family, and teammates that he was in danger, but he was vague about the details. The FBI was called in to investigate and what they uncovered not only shocked Patrick's tight knight group of friends, but also threatened to upend the institution of college basketball at Baylor University by exposing the corruption at it's core.</p>\n\n\n<p>This one is bonkers, you guys.</p>\n",
