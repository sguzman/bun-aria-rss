But Brit Rock had a new wave of bands that preferred heaviness to cribbing from the Beatles. Amongst this lot were Feeder, framed as the plucky underdogs.  At first dubbed the “British Smashing Pumpkins”, Feeder hit the scene delivering grunge-affected heavy pop gems imbued with heart, charm and nostalgia for better days. Though they would score twenty Top 40 singles, their 2001 hit about a brand new car would be the one that remains glued in the national consciousness, in spite of their frontman’s enduring indifference to it. This is New British Canon, and this is the story of “Buck Rogers.”\n\n#feeder #BuckRogers #MusicDocumentary\n\nFact-checking by Serenity Autumn.\n\nSoundtrack\nLuar - Citrine (https://soundcloud.com/luarbeats)\nJesse Gallagher - The Golden Present\nB-Side - Pen Unubis\nLuar - Anchor (https://soundcloud.com/luarbeats)\n\n00:00 Introduction\n01:20 \"Don't Wait Up Because I Won't Be Home\"\n06:12 \"Buck Rogers\": \"I Think We're Gonna Make It\"\n10:25 Echo Park: 2001 - The Good Year\n13:47 Comfort in Sound: 2002 - The Bad Year\n17:52 Feeder Twenty Years Later\n\nYou can also follow me here:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TrashTheory\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TrashTheoryYT\n\nOr support me on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/TrashTheory",
