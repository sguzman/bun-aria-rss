  "title": "PMS 2.0 332 - Urban Meyer To Jacksonville, Justin Jefferson, Darius Slay, & AJ Hawk",
  "description": "On today's show, Pat and the boys react to the news broken by friend of the program Michael Lombardi that Urban Meyer to Jacksonville is essentially a done deal, who he might bring in to fill out his coaching staff, if Shad Khan is going to retain roster control, if Trevor Lawrence will be his QB, and everything else going on in the league as we approach the Divisional Round of the playoffs. Joining the show is a man who broke the rookie receiving record, Pro Bowler, All-Pro, potential Rookie of the Year and friend of the program, Justin Jefferson. Pat and Justin chat about his first season in the NFL, what he's working on this offseason, if he trains with other top WR's, his relationship with Kirk Cousins, how he was so successful this year, and whose Griddy is worse, Kirk or Adam Thielen (21:36-45:09). Next, 3x Pro Bowler, All-Pro, CB for the Philadelphia Eagles, Darius Slay joins the show to chat with Pat and AJ about his time in Detroit, what it was like coming to Philadelphia, if the locker room was aware of everything going on behind the scenes, who the toughest WR in the league to defend is, playing against Aaron Rodgers for 7 years, and much more (48:25-1:06:20). Lastly, Pat and AJ chat about a declassified document that brings to light some new alien news, who the Eagles next Head Coach might be, and look ahead to this weekend's games (1:20:39-1:37:03).
