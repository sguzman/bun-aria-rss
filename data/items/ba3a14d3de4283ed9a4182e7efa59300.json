  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, it’s unequivocal that the Democrat Party hates America as does the Democrat Party press because the voters did not give them the power they starve for. President Trump exercised his duty to protect and defend America and our interests after an Iranian-backed militia killed an American citizen and then attacked the U.S Embassy in Baghdad. Iran has been at war with America, chanting \"Death to America\" for nearly half a century, killing and maiming U.S soldiers since the days of President Carter. Yet the media is silent, not a single Gold-Star Family has been interviewed for their reaction to the killing of Qasem Soleimani, who is in large part, responsible for these atrocities. Then, the Trump Doctrine is similar to the Reagan Doctrine in that it relies on a strong military for American national security. Trump's Doctrine is unique in that it rejects the appeasement of the Obama Doctrine, as well as the interventionist and nation-building of the Bush Doctrine. Trump stood up and was guided by prudence as opposed to politics in making the decision to eliminate Soleimani. The Founders decided long ago that battlefield decisions would be made by the Commander-In-Chief, not by Congress. Afterward, Nancy Pelosi has failed to deliver the articles of impeachment and Mitch McConnell has the power to dismiss the articles.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
