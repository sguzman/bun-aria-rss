  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Helping others to establish a dominant brand through podcasting is what Podcast Powertrain is all about. One of the many people that make that possible is Alundas Havens.  His tumultuous upbringing caused him to develop grit and a strong work ethic. Despite his tough childhood, Alundas knew from an early age that he was going to make it, even if it was just to prove everyone wrong. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">After 4 years in the Marine Corp., Alundas tried his hand at a few things, but really wanted to start a podcast. When there was an opportunity to purchase Zach’s podcasting course for just $47, Alundas dove in. He was deeply motivated by the Underdog Empowerment Movement group, especially by Zach himself. Launching The Winner’s Paradigm podcast, Alundas got on Zach’s radar. Zach was impressed by Alundas’ grit and determination, and he knew he was someone he needed on his team. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>What You’ll Learn:</strong></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">How Alundas’ childhood shaped him into who he is today.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">What Alundas hopes to achieve with his podcast.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">What core values Alundas lives by. </span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">And much more!!</span></li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><strong>Favorite Quote:</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“As entrepreneurs, as alphas, we figure out the way to win, and then we dominate.” -Alundas Havens</span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Connect With Alundas:</strong></p> <p> </p> <p><a href= \"https://www.linkedin.com/in/alundas-havens/\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">LinkedIn</span></a></p> <p> </p> <p><a href=\"https://www.thewinnersparadigm.com\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">The Winners Paradigm</span></a></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>How to Get Involved:</strong></p> <p> </p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get podcasting help</span> <a href=\"https://podcastpowertrain.com/\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more on</span> <a href= \"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ep-310-sneaky-good-marketing-strategies-with-rich-schefren/id1373572178?i=1000546792970\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how to grow your business</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, check out this episode. </span></p> <p><br /> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you enjoyed this episode, head over and visit us on</span> <a href= \"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apple Podcasts</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- leave a review and let us know what you thought!
