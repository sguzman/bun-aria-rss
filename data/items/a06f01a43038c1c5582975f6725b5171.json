  "description": "<p><em>“</em>Nothing in life is to be feared, it is only to be understood. Now is the time to understand more, so that we may fear less.” ― Marie Curie</p> <p>Over the last few months, you’ve probably heard a lot of buzz about how you should be avoiding others, staying indoors, and wearing a mask. While there’s certainly a time for being cautious, I’ve found myself wondering why news outlets aren’t sharing more empowering information. There is a lot you can do to improve your immune function and protect your body from chronic illnesses so that you can better fight off infections.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p>Feeling powerless and fearful is no way to navigate your life. Instead, I want you to be equipped with real, proven information that gives you peace and preparation. Together, we can change the conversation and shift from living in an epidemic of fear to thriving in our own knowledge and understanding.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p>On today’s show, we’re going to discuss questioning not only what you hear on the news, but also your own self-serving biases. We’re going to focus on working with the scientific evidence that we already have, instead of waiting and wishing for a different outcome. I hope this episode arms you with the education you need to feel empowered in your choices and take authority over your health.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p><strong>In this episode you’ll discover:</strong></p> <ul> <li>How a <strong>self-serving bias</strong> works, and how you can challenge it.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></li> <li>Why the US has been hit so hard by COVID-19.</li> <li>The three things you do every day that contribute to your <strong>cellular makeup.</strong></li> <li>How many American citizens have diabetes or prediabetes.</li> <li>The link between <strong>immune function and viral infection deaths</strong>.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></li> <li>How conventional medicine and specialization can often miss the big picture.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></li> <li>The <strong>most effective thing</strong> we can do to improve the COVID-19 survival rate.</li> <li>How simply going on a short walk can boost your immune system.</li> <li>The relationship between vitamin D deficiency and COVID-19 infection rates.</li> <li>How quality sleep can <strong>improve your natural killer cell production</strong>.</li> <li>Why we need to better utilize the data we have on immune function.</li> <li>How chronic illnesses make us more susceptible to infectious diseases.</li> <li>The <strong>top three causes of death</strong> in the US.</li> <li>How many American people die from heart disease each year.</li> <li>What you need to know about exposure to carcinogens.</li> <li>The <strong>drawbacks of wearing a mask</strong> long-term.</li> </ul> <p><strong>Items mentioned in this episode include:</strong></p> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://themodelhealthshow.com/onnit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Onnit.com/model</a> ⇐ Get your optimal health & performance supplements at 10% off!</li> <li><a href=\"https://themodelhealthshow.com/beekeepers\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Beekeepersnaturals.com/model</a> ⇐ Get 15% off raw honey & other natural remedies!</li> <li><a href= \"https://themodelhealthshow.com/global-pandemic/\">Global Pandemic, The Human Virome, & Thriving During Chaos – Episode 405</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://themodelhealthshow.com/manage-stress/\">8 Powerful Ways to Manage Stress During Complicated Times – Episode 417</a></li> <li><a href= \"https://themodelhealthshow.com/human-virus-quarantine/\">Why Quarantine Has Us More Unhealthy Than Ever – Episode 411</a></li> <li><a href=\"https://sleepsmarterbook.com/\">Sleep Smarter by Shawn Stevenson</a></li> </ul> <p>* <a href= \"https://themodelhealthshow.s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/Episode+418.pdf\"> <em><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Download Transcript</span></em></a></p> <p><strong>Be sure you are subscribed to this podcast to automatically receive your episodes: </strong></p> <ul> <li><a href= \"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-model-health-show/id640246578\"> Apple Podcasts</a></li> <li><a href= \"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/model-health-show/the-model-health-show\"> Stitcher</a></li> <li><a href= \"https://open.spotify.com/show/6F3aCAq1L6k3eVqfaveMCp\">Spotify</a></li> <li><a href= \"https://soundcloud.com/themodelhealthshow\">Soundcloud</a></li> </ul> <p>Join TMHS Facebook community - <a href= \"https://www.facebook.com/groups/2393689010676188/\">Model Nation</a> </p>",
