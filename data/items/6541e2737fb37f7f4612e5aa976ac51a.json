  "description": "This week, the gals focus their attention on some cases involving one too many lovers. Topics include some incriminating Facebook posts, major drama in a hotel lobby, and a healthy(ish) dose of Freud. Pop open a fresh bottle of Ménage à Trois Red Blend, give your Brandy and Monica CD a break, and tune in for Love Triangles.",
