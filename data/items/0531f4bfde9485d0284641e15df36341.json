  "description": "<p>So much happened on Bravo this week that it's a miracle we fit it all in on this week's \"Watch What Crappens.\" We start with the \"Vanderpump Rules\" finale where seven of our brightest young minds convene to make articulate points about their lives and loves. Just kidding: it was basically just Kristen rolling her eyes and spewing venom.<br />\nThen it's on to \"Real Housewives of Beverly Hills\" where Ronnie Karam (trashtalktv.com) and Ben Mandelker (bsideblog.com) struggle to understand just what Lisa Vanderpump did to annoy Brandi Glanville so much.<br />\nNext we take on the Sunday brawls on \"Real Housewives of Atlanta\" and \"Blood, Sweat, and Heels\" before voicing our dissatisfaction with the \"Top Chef: New Orleans\" finale. Finally, things wrap up with the Shahs' visit to Iran.<br />\nIt's a whole lot of content.
