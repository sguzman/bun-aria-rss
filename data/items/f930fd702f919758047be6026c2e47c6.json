    "media:description": "Choosing the right heat sink is part of deploying a good thermal management solution, the other part is the attachment method. Whether clip, push pin, z-clip, or other, the attachment has an important impact on how effective the thermal solution is. This webinar will cover these issues including attachments for rectangular packages increasingly used in SoC and SiP packages. A handy technical reference sheet and white paper on attachment types will be provided to those who register. This webinar, presented by ATS Product Engineering Manager, Greg Wong will address all these issues and more.\n\nTo register for future webinars please visit qats.com/Training/Webinars\n\nhttps://www.qats.com&#13;\nAdvanced Thermal Solutions, Inc.&#13;\nA leading-edge engineering and manufacturing company focused on the thermal management of electronics.&#13;\n&#13;\nService, Products and Training&#13;\n• Cooling Solutions – From Chip to System&#13;\n• Mechanical Packaging and Design&#13;\n• Design Services&#13;\n• Air and Liquid Cooling Solutions&#13;\n• Rapid Prototyping&#13;\n• Custom Heat Sink Design&#13;\n• Research Grade Thermal Instruments&#13;\n• Engineering Training&#13;\n• State-of-the-art Experimental Laboratories&#13;\n• Qpedia Thermal eMagazine",
