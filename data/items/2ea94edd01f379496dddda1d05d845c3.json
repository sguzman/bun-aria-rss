  "description": "A single idea can be a parasite to the mind. It can enter our thoughts without us even knowing, bury itself deep within our psyche, and transform our entire reality and outlook on the world. Do you have the mental strength, prowess, and awareness needed to identify when this may be happening? On this episode of Conversations with Tom, professor and author of ‘The Parasitic Mind,’ Dr. Gad Saad, joins Tom Bilyeu to discuss such important matters and more as they explore how ideas can act as parasites to the mind and what you should be mindful of in this age of identity politics. They discuss the dangers of post-modernism, the changing culture in the western world, the void of common sense, nature versus nurture, why people latch onto ideas that separate them from true reality, how America is closer to a civil war than one might think, and how identity politics is a slippery slope that leads to dangerous consequences.   Purchase Gad’s book, “The Parasitic Mind”:  <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Parasitic-Mind-Infectious-Killing-Common/dp/162157959X\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.amazon.com/Parasitic-Mind-Infectious-Killing-Common/dp/162157959X</a> This episode is brought to you by: Indeed: Go to Indeed.com/IMPACT for a FREE $75 credit to boost your job post.
