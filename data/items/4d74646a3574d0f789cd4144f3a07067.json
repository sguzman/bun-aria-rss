  "description": "Five years ago, the Russian invasion of Eastern Ukraine began. That was followed by the annexation of Crimea, US and European sanctions and, soon after, by stepped Russian efforts to undermine the leaders and parties in the West that were opposing him. Which of course, leads not just to Donald Trump but to Brexit and the rise of the right in Europe. It's a stunning turn of events...and events look like they're going to be turning just like this for some time to come. No one is better equipped to make sense of this and give us a perspective on where we are going than former U.S. Ambassador to Russia and professor at Stanford University Michael McFaul. It's a great, thoughtful and wide-ranging conversation. Please tune in\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
