  "description": "<p>The day has finally come... Kirk Minihane is scheduled to interview Stevie Van Zandt later today. Following Wednesday's show, the guys discuss the tension between Quantum Week Chris and Dave (00:10:24). Chris brings what he called a \"game\" but it was more of an \"activity\" (00:32:00). It did reveal Chris' past as \"Monkey Boy.\" The Kirk Minihane Show is listed as an available podcast on Audacy, which is a problem for Kirk (00:19:02). Steve Perrault is leaving Section 10 and headed to Audacy. Kirk and Chris take issue with Dave's take on benefactors of notoriety & much more.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
