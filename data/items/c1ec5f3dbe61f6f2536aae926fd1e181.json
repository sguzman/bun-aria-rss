  "description": "<p>How do you work smarter and not harder?</p> <p>If you’re like the rest of us, you want to become more efficient by working smarter—not just harder. You already know what it’s like to feel overwhelmed with long to-do lists, stressful demands, and the pressure of not having enough time. This burden can feel even heavier when all of these tasks feel high-priority and can’t be ignored.</p> <p>Today, I want to talk about how to focus on the things that matter the most so that you can exert the same amount of effort but yield the highest possible rewards.</p> <p>When you’re weighed down with an endless list of tasks, it can feel like you’re being held back and aren’t able to pursue the things you really want to do. Even worse, it can lead to burnout. So if you’re struggling to identify how to apply your efforts to produce maximum results, this episode is for you.</p> <p>*** Do you want to stay up to date with every new episode and get my brand new Kwik Brain Accelerator Program?
