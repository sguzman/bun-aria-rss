  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, why did former AG Bill Barr stay with the Trump Administration as long as he did if Trump was as bad as he said he was? Barr erroneously assumes that the appointment of a Special Master for the FBI raid is a red herring when the issue at hand is the protection of privilege or one's fourth amendment right. If privilege simply didn't matter then it wouldn't be part of the Presidential Records Act. Then, this program will never defend the people that broke into the Capitol on January 6 and attacked cops. However, the greatest war this country has ever fought was the Civil War. Abraham Lincoln's second inaugural address preached unity and reconciliation for the nation when he said \"With malice toward none and charity for all.\" Lincoln didn't condemn the confederate Democrats or mention the names of political opponents because he didn't want to even the score, he wanted to keep the nation together. By contrast, President Biden's speech did the exact opposite. Afterward, Sen. Ron Johnson calls in with an update on his senate race. Johnson also called out the FBI for corruption when they presented phony briefings to senators to smear them. Johnson contends that the FBI has done more to meddle in US elections than any foreign enemy has. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
