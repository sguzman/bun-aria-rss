Does Chris have what it takes to recognize and reproduce this French comfort food classic without seeing what it is?&#13;\n&#13;\nDirector: Cory Cavin&#13;\nDirector: Matt Hunziker&#13;\nDirector of Photography: Eric Brouse&#13;\nEditor: Michael Imhoff&#13;\nHost: Chris Morocco&#13;\nSr. Culinary Director: Kelly Janke&#13;\nProducer: Halie Aaron &#13;\nCulinary Producer: Stevie Stewart &#13;\nCulinary Associate Producer: Rebecca Lucarelli&#13;\nLine Producer: Jen McGinity &#13;\nAssociate Producer: Yoshivel Chirinos&#13;\nProduction Manager: Janine Dispensa&#13;\nProduction Coordinator: Elizabeth Hymes &#13;\nCamera Operator: Jeremy Harris&#13;\nAudio: Lily Van Leewuen&#13;\nProduction Assistant: Alaina Chou&#13;\nPost Production Supervisor: Steph Cardone &#13;\nPost Production Coordinator: Scout Alter &#13;\nSupervising Editor: Eduardo Araújo&#13;\nAssistant Editor: Diego Rentsch\n\nWant Bon Appétit shirts, hats and more? https://shop.bonappetit.com/?utm_source=youtube&utm_brand=ba&utm_campaign=aud-dev&utm_medium=video&utm_content=merch-shop-promo&#13;\n&#13;\nStill haven’t subscribed to Bon Appétit on YouTube? ►► http://bit.ly/1TLeyPn&#13;\n&#13;\nWant more Bon Appétit in your life?
