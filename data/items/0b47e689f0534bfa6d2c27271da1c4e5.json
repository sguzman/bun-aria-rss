  "description": "<pre><code>The Big Pygmy - with @thebigmygmy   \"160,000 kids in the United States alone skip school every day because of bullying.\" These words were spoken by the legend himself, Justin Wren aka The Big Pigmy.    Only 20 - 30% of students who are bullied notify adults about the problem. That is why it is so important for those of you who are experiencing this nightmare to tell someone. And if that person doesn't listen then tell someone else. There is someone out there who loves and cares for you.   In this interview, Justin shares his first-hand experience of being bullied and how he overcame addiction and disappointment to become dubbed, \"The Big Pygmy.\"   The real fight of his life began with his journey to The Congo where he helped negotiate the freedom of hundreds of enslaved people and launch sustainable farming initiatives including clean water.    He was called \"Efeosa,\" which means \"the man who loves us,\" and founded the \"Fight For the Forgotten\" a non profit fighting to empower those who don't have a voice - from the forgotten people around the world affected by the water crisis, to the bullied in our own neighborhoods and schools.   Join me in experiencing this powerful and inspiring interview about the fight The Big Pygmy fought every day outside of the ring and how he found his life's calling through God and servitude.    WATCH/LISTEN NOW!   Please SUBSCRIBE to all platforms, by CLICKING THE LINK IN MY BIO.
