Newspapers carried headlines like \"Hunt for the Head\" and \"Headless Horror.\" Quickly, the crime scene became a tourist attraction and visitors traveled from all over to collect bloody souvenirs. The gruesome details were adapted into a popular song that's been recorded dozens of times. We talk with folklorist Sarah Bryan about the true story behind the murder ballad, and the band Elephant Micah performs an original arrangement.\nDownload Elephant Micah’s “Pearl Bryan” on iTunes or Bandcamp.
