  "description": "Touring the world opened up Kane's eyes that he had a wider audience.  On \"It's A Big Daddy Thing\", Kane wanted to tap into that audience.  The creation of songs like \"Smooth Operator\", \"Warm It Up, Kane\", \"Young, Gifted And Black\" and \"I Get The Job Done\" not only have hilarious stories behind them, but also were made to show the growth of Kane as an artist.  Kane's popularity was expanding and it wasn't just amongst his fans.  He was now being called on for features by fellow musicians such as Rick James and Quincy Jones.
