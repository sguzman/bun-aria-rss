  "description": "<p>This week on <em>Eat Your Words</em>, host Cathy Erway is getting a head start to the growing season! Chatting small-scale agriculture and the book “Microfarming for Profit: from Garden to Glory” with author Dave DeWitt and Bee Ayer, collective member and co-farm manager at the Youth Farm at BK Farmyards in Brooklyn, NY. Dave’s book is an entrepreneur’s guide which profiles successful microfarms around the country, teaches how to sell what’s produced, and specifies value-added products that can quickly increase the farmer’s bottom lineâ€”on five acres or less. Bee adds thoughts on the matter as well from her experiences in urban and youth farming and brings up the discussion on whether to grow things for the community versus growing items that will yield a higher profit. Thinking about getting into small-scale agriculture? Tune in for a great show!
