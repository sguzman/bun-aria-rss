  "title": "PMS 2.0 387 - Feel Good Good Friday, Xavier Rhodes, & Ariel Helwani",
  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys slog through this Feel Good, Good Friday chatting about Jeff Bezos potentially buying the Chargers and why the richest man in the world getting into the NFL would be a good thing, what's going on around the NFL, and much more. Next, 3x Pro Bowl, All-Pro, former Minnesota Vikings CB and current Indianapolis Colts CB, Xavier Rhodes joins the program to chat about what it has been in Indianapolis that has gotten him back to his dominant play, what he loves about playing for Frank Reich, what WR's have given him the most trouble during his time in the league, if he likes being able to do the offseason virtually, and much more (32:40-51:19). Later, ESPN MMA Insider, former friend of the program (before the ban), Ariel Helwani joins the program to chat about his time away from the show, a certain April Fools prank that had us all confused, and ultimately, if he thinks Jon Jones and Francis Ngannou are going to fight each other in the Octagon (1:02:23-1:35:03).
