  "description": "<p>Everyone feels under greater psychic pressure these days, but we adults hope that children, who have always been seen as naturally resilient, have been spared the stress. Unfortunately, kids are increasingly experiencing mental health problems like anxiety at younger and younger ages, and this trend has been going on for years. </p>\n<p>My guest today wrote <a href=\"https://www.theatlantic.com/press-releases/archive/2020/04/the-anxious-child-and-the-crisis-of-modern-parenting/609901/\">a cover article for <em>The Atlantic</em> on the causes and cures of this phenomenon</a>. Her name is Kate Julian and we begin our conversation today by describing the extent to which problems like depression, anxiety, and even suicide have been on the rise among children, and how these issues correlate with continued problems later in life. We then talk about the possible causes behind the increase in childhood anxiety, and whether technology and social media are to blame. We then delve into the idea of how parents are perpetuating their children's anxiety through their own anxiety and their willingness to make accommodations to keep their kids calm and happy. We get into the idea that getting your children comfortable with being uncomfortable can inoculate them against anxiety, and end our conversation with a discussion of whether more exposure to the news of a tumultuous world might actually make kids more resilient.</p>\n<p>Get the show notes at <a href=\"aom.is/childhoodanxiety\">aom.is/childhoodanxiety</a>.</p>\n",
