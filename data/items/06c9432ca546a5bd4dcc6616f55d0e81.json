  "description": "Quavo is in the house, and talks about his influences, collab’ing with Justin Bieber and Jay-Z & Beyonce, creating with family, making movies with Randall, and the meaning of “grouped out.” And it’s the return of BravoCon this Fall in New York City, and Randall remembers his first-ever experience with the #PumpRules fans! Plus, congrats to James Kennedy & Raquel Leviss on their engagement! Lala and Rand were there and spill the tea on the magical night, and they give an update on their own rescheduled wedding plans (and is that a wedding band on Rand’s finger?). And Baby O rules the roost but not the swimming pool!\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
