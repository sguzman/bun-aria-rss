  "description": "<p>Lots of schools are closed and people are staying home. In this episode we’ll explain how all of this could help slow the spread of the new coronavirus. We’ll explain some terms you’re probably hearing too, like “social distancing” and “flattening the curve.” </p>\n<p>Plus, we talk with a doctor who is on the front lines helping people get better, and two virus podcasters help answer your coronavirus questions like, “How did this virus start?” and “Can our pets get sick too?” </p>\n<p>And of course there’s a Mystery Sound and a Moment of Um looking at why our tongues stick to ice.</p>\n<p><em>Please note that this episode was released on March 24, 2020.
