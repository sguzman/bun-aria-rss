  "content:encoded": "<p>We realized many of our discussions on the <em><a href=\"http://reformedforum.org/rmr\">Reformed Media Review</a></em> were drifting toward the philosophical.&nbsp; And we also believe there is a general lack of good philosophical resources â€“ at least from people working from a Reformed theological framework.&nbsp; As a result, we bring you <em><a href=\"http://reformedforum.org/pft\">Philosophy for Theologians</a></em>. Our goal in this program&nbsp;is to provide an overview of a particular philosophical figure or an idea and to analyze it critically through the lens of Scripture.&nbsp; That doesn&#8217;t mean proof-texting Kant&#8217;s views, but it does mean that we consider everything in light of God&#8217;s revelation. &nbsp; We not only want to address philosophical questions on <em><a href=\"http://reformedforum.org/pft\">Philosophy for Theologians</a></em>, but we want to equip you with a way to think about these questions. In this wide-ranging discussion, the panel begins with a discussion between Nate Shannon and Bob LaRocca regarding the role of realism in Herman Bavinck and the consistency thereof. &nbsp; The discussions moves on and touches, among other things, upon Thomas Reid, Alvin Plantinga and possible worlds semantics.</p>\n<p class='podcast-participants'>Participants: <a href=\"http://reformedforum.org/people/bob-larocca/\" rel=\"tag\">Bob LaRocca</a><span class=\"sep\">,</span> <a href=\"http://reformedforum.org/people/camden-bucey/\" rel=\"tag\">Camden Bucey</a><span class=\"sep\">,</span> <a href=\"http://reformedforum.org/people/jared-oliphint/\" rel=\"tag\">Jared Oliphint</a><span class=\"sep\">,</span> <a href=\"http://reformedforum.org/people/jonathan-brack/\" rel=\"tag\">Jonathan Brack</a><span class=\"sep\">,</span> <a href=\"http://reformedforum.org/people/nate-shannon/\" rel=\"tag\">Nate Shannon</a></p>\n",
