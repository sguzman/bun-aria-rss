  "title": "Charles William Johns, \"Object Oriented Dialectics: Hegel, Heidegger, Harman\" (Mimesis International, 2022)",
  "description": "In Object Oriented Dialectics: Hegel, Heidegger, Harman (Mimesis, 2022), Johns, in the style of Derrida, looks over the absence or spectre of the signifier ‘dialectic’ in both Martin Heidegger and Graham Harman’s work, arguing that such a negation of the term turns out to be more of an intentional repression than any passive act of neglection. Johns insists that such repression finds its way into their writing as an alternative interpretation of their core concepts altogether. Less a Hegelian critique of such thinkers and more a Heideggerian and Harmanian resuscitation of the dialectic in Hegel as a realist method capable of integration into contemporary philosophy, this book will be invaluable to anyone interested in the crossroads of contemporary strands of idealism, materialism and realism and the place of the dialectical method today.\nAdam Bobeck is a PhD candidate in Cultural Anthropology at the University of Leipzig. His PhD is entitled “Object-Oriented Azadari: Shi’i Muslim Rituals and Ontology”. For more about his work, see www.adambobeck.com.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
