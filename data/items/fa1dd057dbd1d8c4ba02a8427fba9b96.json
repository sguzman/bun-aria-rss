  "title": "“Gentle” Parents Still Set Boundaries With Destini Davis",
  "description": "There’s this fear that honoring our kids’ emotions when they throw tantrums or break the rules reinforces “bad” behavior. That if we don’t use punishment… we’re just being permissive. Here’s the truth: There’s nothing “soft” about parenting with empathy. This week, parenting coach Destini Davis joins Dr. Becky for a total reframe of what it really means to be a sturdy leader. The two open up about their own parenting philosophy journeys and how they realized that building connection with our kids goes hand-in-hand with holding firm boundaries. As they answer callers’ live questions about tricky situations with their kids, they debunk outdated ideas on “shaping behavior” and share deep thoughts about what actually leads to change. Their lively conversation will give you practical strategies for setting intentional limits, tolerating your child’s frustration, embodying your authority, and—most importantly—trusting yourself in the process. <p/>\n<p/>\nJoin Good Inside Membership: https://bit.ly/3cqgG2A  <p/>\nFollow Dr. Becky on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drbeckyatgoodinside <p/>\nSign up for our weekly email, Good Insider: https://www.goodinside.com/newsletter <p/>\nPre-order Dr. Becky's upcoming book, Good Inside: A Guide to Becoming the Parent You Want to Be: www.goodinside.com/book or wherever you order your books.<p/>\n<p/>\n",
