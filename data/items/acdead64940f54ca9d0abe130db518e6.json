  "description": "<p><em>On Things Heard</em> (Greek ΠΕΡΙ ΑΚΟΥΣΤΩΝ, Latin DE AUDIBILIBUS) is a work which was formerly attributed to Aristotle, but is now generally believed to be the work of Strato of Lampsacus who was the third scholarch of the Lyceum. Our extant version of <em>On Things Heard</em> is made up of long extracts included in Porphyry's <em>Commentary on Ptolemy's Harmonics</em>, and is thus partial. The extracts are concerned with the nature of sound production.
