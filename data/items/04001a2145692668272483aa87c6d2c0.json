  "description": "Right now most of us are suffering through the effects of a global pandemic, one way or another. And perhaps one of the best ways to deal with such collective pain is to listen to those who have already overcome serious trauma in their own lives. Fran Drescher has survived both a vicious sexual assault and uterine cancer, and has managed to find ways to turn those experiences into something positive. On this episode of Impact Theory with Tom Bilyeu, Fran Drescher talks openly about the mistakes she made when first trying to heal, then describes what actually worked. She also details the efforts she makes to trust and take control of her body, discusses what it really means to live in the present moment, and even shares some simple actions anyone can take that kill viruses.
