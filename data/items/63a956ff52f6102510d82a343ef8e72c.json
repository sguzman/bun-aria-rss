  "description": "On Monday’s Mark Levin Show, the liberals in the media are upset with Mark for speaking the truth about Biden and the Democrats sabotaging our economy and our energy industry. The left within the media treat climate activism like a religion as they advance intersectionality. Then, a 22-year-old Good Samaritan with a handgun stopped a mass shooting at an Indiana mall. It is yet another example of a good guy with a gun stopping a bad guy with a gun, compared to new details emerging in the ultimate failure with law enforcement in Uvalde. Later, all-sides-ism once known as objectivity is coming into question in a new Pew Research poll, yet the media views their job as the editors of truth as opposed to the reporters of it. Afterward, Iran has threatened to assassinate former President Donald Trump and former US Secretary of State Mike Pompeo. Interestingly the media hasn't reported on that but they sure are focused on Steve Bannon and the upcoming January 6th hearing. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
