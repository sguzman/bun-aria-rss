  "description": "<p>Anjelica Huston has lived many lives, all with grace and charisma. As the daughter of John Huston (director of <em>The African Queen</em>, <em>The Maltese Falcon</em>, and more) she was movie royalty from birth. But she grew up in rural Ireland and went to high school in Swinging-Sixties London. That meant she developed a set of values far removed from Hollywood high society. Her first career was as a high-end fashion model, a favorite subject of Richard Avedon and later a muse of Halston. But she had always wanted to be a movie actress, and she spent time in the trenches, working on her craft in classes and smaller roles before her Oscar-winning turn in <em>Prizzi's Honor</em>. Right as she was leaving the photo studio for the movie studio, she met Jack Nicholson: \"he made me laugh,\" she tells Alec. The couple defined Hollywood cool for almost two decades. Huston tells Alec the story of all of her transitions -- romantic, professional, and geographic. Her two wonderful memoirs are <a href=\"https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781451656299\">A Story Lately Told</a> and <a href=\"https://www.indiebound.org/book/9781476760346\">Watch Me</a>.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
