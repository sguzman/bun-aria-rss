  "title": "NFL Mock Draft Monday 1.0: Breaking down Trevor Lawrence and the rest of the quarterbacks (Football 2/15)",
  "description": "Welcome to draft season! Each Monday over the next few months, the Pick Six feed will be dedicated to draft content and mock drafts (with plenty of mid-week coverage as well). We start things today with a set-up of things to come. Trevor Lawrence is the blatantly obvious #1 overall selection as Ryan Wilson details what makes him such a great prospect. Then, we shift focus to the rest of the quarterback class and Wilson's unique rankings. Who's the 2nd-best QB behind Lawrence? Is it Justin Fields, Zach Wilson Mac Jones or even Trey Lance? Quarterbacks tend to dominate the pre-draft discussion, so we set the table here but will cover everything you need to know in the coming weeks regarding the 2021 NFL Draft. \n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nYou can listen to Pick Six on your smart speakers!
