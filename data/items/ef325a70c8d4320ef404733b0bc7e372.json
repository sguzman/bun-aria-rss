In this episode I take a look at a neat new study that involved having singers lie down in an MRI while their brains were scanned. Take a look at how your cerebellum, your parietal lobe your somato-sentory cortex and your amygdala are all involved in your ability to sing.  I'll also look at how mental rehearsal can positively affect how well you perform a task. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><ul><br /><li>Kleber, B., Veit, R., Birbaumer, N., Gruzelier, J., & Lotze, M.
