  "description": "<p>I will be speaking to “D” and he writes “I was walking to my hunting spot late one afternoon and I saw a creature break a tree. This thing was wounded in the shoulder and it’s left arm hung limp. I don’t know if it was shot or hit by a car but it’s arm wasn’t being used. I was heading to my spot an it had rained the night before, it was the 2nd day of buck season. This creature broke a 6 inch tree using its right foot and it’s right hand. I was squatted down in some mountain Lorele an watched it for about 10 to 12 min. The creature broke apart an old stump, I think it was eating ants. The creature milled around some and sniffed the air. I thought it could smell me but I was up on a ridge line. It looked around but I don’t think it ever knew I was there. I would like to speak with you and share with you the details of what I saw.”</p> <p><strong>East Texas Sasquatch Expeditions Update</strong>: Bob Garrett will be coming on the show tonight to talk about some of the things they are planning for their East Texas Sasquatch Expeditions. You might be interested in some of things they are planning including having a commercial drone pilot on site during the expeditions.</p>",
