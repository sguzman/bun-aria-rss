  "description": "<p>In this busy news day, Charlie covers multiple, seemingly unrelated bombshell stories, all in one episode, and then explains how they're all actually a symptom of the same cultural disease. Charlie breaks down the breaking news that the Chinese Communist Party was colluding with an election technology firm based out of Michigan, and was granted access to the names of nearly 2 million poll workers. But why did George Gascon, the Soros puppet bring the charges? Next, Charlie covers some of the most explosive clips from Tucker Carlson's interview with Tony Bobulinski exposing the Biden family for their relationship with China and exactly how much money they stood to make from the CCP. Finally, Charlie gives the audience a terrifying look into our woke future where a Vermont high school girls volleyball team is now facing disciplinary actions for speaking out against a male athlete having access to their locker room.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.charliekirk.com/support\" rel=\"payment\">Support the show: http://www.charliekirk.com/support</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
