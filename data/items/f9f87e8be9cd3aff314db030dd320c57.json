  "description": "In November 2015, Pope Francis made a call to theologians to explore whether Catholic practice ought to be amended to include Christians from different churches in full participation in the Eucharist. Thomas O’Loughlin replies in his book, Eating Together, Becoming One: Taking Up Pope Francis’s Call to Theologians (Liturgical Press Academic, 2019). This is an insightful and practical book exploring theological arguments for intercommunion. O’Loughlin builds on the initial sketches offered by Pope Francis, and investigates the grammar of meals as an anthropological community building activity, the role of the Holy Spirit in liturgical practice, and the teleology of Eucharistic ritual. This is an accessible and important book contributing toward an ecumenical posture of unity across Christian traditions, and is as valuable for its approach and tone as for its penetrating insights. \nTom O'Loughlin is Professor Emeritus of Historical Theology at the University of Nottingham.\n Ryan David Shelton (@ryoldfashioned) is a social historian of British and American Protestantism and a PhD researcher at Queen’s University Belfast.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
