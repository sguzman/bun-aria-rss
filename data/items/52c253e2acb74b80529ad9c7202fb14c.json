  "description": "<p>We have a great chat for you today as we bring you our first taste of Rhythmic Gymnastics by speaking with two members of the history making Australian group team from Tokyo, Emily Abbot & Alannah Mathews! Both Emily & Alannah tell us about their different journey into the sport of Rhythmic Gymnastics and why it is a sport that needs to be talked about more in Australia. We also learn about how concussion is a possibility in the sport, just how strenuous that training routines are in the lead up to an Olympic Games as well as all the finer aspects of the technical side of the sport and just what on earth a koala has to do with their competition. Added to this a large dose of nicknames, ABBA and perhaps the most philosophical answers you will ever hear, this is one fun and entertaining chat you won’t want to miss!</p>",
