Mark also runs one of the largest personal growth websites in the world, and his writing is often described as \"self-help for people who hate self-help.\" In a <a href=\"https://www.goodlifeproject.com/podcast/mark-manson/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">past podcast conversation</a> (https://www.goodlifeproject.com/podcast/mark-manson/), we explore Manson's \"origin story\" and love of philosophy and writing, including his choice of profanity in his writing voice (hint: it has nothing to do with linguistic laziness).
