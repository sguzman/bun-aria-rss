  "description": "<p>State-of-the-art speaker verification frameworks have typically focused on\nspeech enhancement techniques with increasingly deeper (more layers) and wider\n(number of channels) models to improve their verification performance. Instead,\nthis paper proposes an approach to increase the model resolution capability\nusing attention-based dynamic kernels in a convolutional neural network to\nadapt the model parameters to be feature-conditioned. The attention weights on\nthe kernels are further distilled by channel attention and multi-layer feature\naggregation to learn global features from speech. This approach provides an\nefficient solution to improving representation capacity with lower data\nresources. This is due to the self-adaptation to inputs of the structures of\nthe model parameters. The proposed dynamic convolutional model achieved 1.62\\%\nEER and 0.18 miniDCF on the VoxCeleb1 test set and has a 17\\% relative\nimprovement compared to the ECAPA-TDNN.\n</p>",
