  "description": "You know it, you see it: there’s something about Lakeith. It’s there in Atlanta, in Get Out, in Someone Great… the list goes on. It’s actually many things — ace acting ability, a bucketload of confident, quirky charm, and a presence that belies his slight and lovely frame, all in a relatively short career so far. We wade through all these thirst-inducing attributes, as well as what it means to fancy a Thirst Object when they’ve messed up… We also have a reader drabble about an old TAK fave, as well as our own new Lakeith-centric fanfic. It’s a good day to be thirsty, pals.\nFollow us on Twitter @ThirstAidKit. Bim is @bimadew and Nichole is @tnwhiskeywoman. Our music is by Tanya Morgan.
