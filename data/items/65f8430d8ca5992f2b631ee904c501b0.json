  "description": "This episode is not a plug for you to hire Alice Lane, but this is if hiring anybody, or if you don’t, this is going to be the work that you should make sure and do for yourself because it’s not something you should phone in and take lightly. You know yourself. If you’re not a great decision maker, you’re not going to be a good designer for yourself. If you waffle, don’t know what to do, and you get paralyzed, and you don’t want to answer, guess who makes the decision for you? Your builder, based on what’s in stock. So you have to be a great decision maker to go this route. A designer is going to help you figure out who you are, what you want, and ultimately is going to save you time and money by doing everything as efficiently as possible. <br /><br />Why it’s important to hire a designer: you’re going to save a lot of money 3:41<br />Our knowledge and our resources 8:53<br />We’re technicians 13:22<br />Timing 19:13<br />Creating schedules 21:17<br />Great decision makers 28:11<br />Executing the design 29:53<br />Great vendor connections 31:05<br /><br />“You guys wanna know something crazy that our Better Builders have been letting us know? We have to have made all our decisions before they even break ground, for the sake of efficiency in ordering things because things are taking so long, not only appliances, but hardware is ridiculous, getting your cabinetry in line with the cabinet shop. You have to be out a long time, and so if you don’t have a designer, and you’re not good at making decisions, this can be really painful to get, like your 2 year build just turned into a 4 year build.” 12:15<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
