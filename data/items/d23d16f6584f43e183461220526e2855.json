So, even if you are in a room with the president of the country, your mother, your boss, and your future spouse, there is no one more important to impress than yourself. If you’ve been here before you’ve probably heard it said, the only thing that matters is how you feel about yourself when you are by yourself. Can you trust yourself to show up and get things done when you say you’re going to? Or do you not believe yourself when you tell someone that you will be there or you will have this done for them by a certain date? It is critical to your future success that you earn trust and have credibility with yourself more than anyone else. Being accountable and reliable for yourself is the secret to building stronger relationships and social networks. Tom is going to take you through why being accountable to yourself matters, how you can build that relationship with yourself, and the unspoken rules of accountability taking place in relationships that you need to be aware of to succeed. Ultimately, accountability comes down to the sincere pursuit of your goals, not actually achieving them.
