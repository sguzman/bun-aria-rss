  "description": "<p>Richard is the owner of Gas Monkey Garage. He rebuilds muscle cars and has a lot of fun doing it. His conversation with Joe was light hearted and very funny. They got down drinking some Gas Monkey Tequila and you can imagine where it went from there.</p>\n <p>Enjoy my review folks!</p>\n <p>Please email me with any suggestions and questions for future Reviews:</p>\n <p>Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com</p>\n",
