  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, Donald Trump saved the Republican Party! Neo-Marxists like Chuck Schumer want to turn America into California suggesting that America needs big bold changes. Why would the greatest country on the face of this earth need such a radical transformation? The framers presumed that the people of this country would have some sort of virtue, sadly the Congress and much of the country is run by a Marxist mob. Using this power is one step closer to destroying capitalism in the name of socialism disguised as racial and economic inequality. Rhetoric like Schumer's was once considered crackpot radicalism and today it's taught in the Ivy League. Then, the Democrats are waging a political war with our freedom, our constitution, and our society, they are the ones inciting hatred. We the people want to be left alone, not a system that is fixed violates our Constitution and run by one party. When critical race theory intersects with Marxism, movements like Black Lives Matter are born. BLM seeks to destroy individualism while dividing one group versus another group. Later, Project Veritas strikes again this time releasing a video of Facebook CEO Mark Zuckerberg. The video is a meeting of Facebook leaders where Zuckerberg praised Biden saying, “In his first day, President Biden already issued a number of executive orders on areas that we as a company care quite deeply about and have for some time..” Afterward, Rep. Elise Stefanik (R-NY) calls in to discuss the mess in New York caused by Gov. Andrew Cuomo and why Harvard University removed her from one of the advisory committees for its school of public policy.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
