    "media:description": "Trichoplax adhaerens is a species of placozoa, the simplest animals at the base of the tree of life. It doesn't have a nervous system, yet it exhibits complex behaviors. How is this possible? The answer could illuminate the origins of the nervous system—and the future of robotics. “It’s a tour de force of biophysics,” said Orit Peleg of the University of Colorado, Boulder.\n\nRead the full article at Quanta Magazine: https://www.quantamagazine.org/this-animals-behavior-is-mechanically-programmed-20220316/\n\nQuanta Magazine is an editorially independent publication supported by the Simons Foundation.",
