  "description": "<p>The Mommies are starting things off with an interesting way for a man to make $20. How much money would it take you to complete this \"task?\" Tom and Christina also wonder who is purchasing adult movies in hotel rooms? They recall the times they've made such purchases. Christina has developed a fascination of Josh Potter's ability to get laid and inquires about that. Plus, Cool Guy Tony makes his triumphant return from Jail.</p> <p>Big Jay Oakerson is a stand-up comic who you can hear on one of his many podcasts, including The SDR Show, Legion of Skanks and on SiriusXM's The Bonfire. Jay also recently acted in a film with Jennifer Lopez called \"Hustlers.\" Jay and Tom talk about meeting during the Oddball tour, and what went wrong with it. The topic of NYC's new found \"woke-ness\" is brought up as Jay had an incident at The Comedy Cellar. Big Jay and Dan Soder often watch clips on their show The Bonfire, including Good Morning Julia, so the Mommies get his insight into it and let him in on what they've found. Big Jay and Dan also reviewed Charro's video, so we relive that with him as well. Robert Paul Champagne is brought to Jay's attention and Jay recounts a story from back in the day when Josh Potter was driving him around for a weekend. Big Jay also tells The Mommies about Skankfest and the Louis CK appearance, and the murder of his manager and owner of The Stand Comedy Club in NYC, Dave Kimowitz.</p>\n",
