  "description": "<p>The Pfister Hotel sits three blocks from Lake Michigan in Milwaukee, Wisconsin and once advertised itself as the only fireproof hotel in the city. The hotel was built to be the \"Grand Hotel of the West\" and it really was a gorgeous hotel with Victorian artwork, beautiful chandeliers and gold trim that still exist. This started as the dream of one man and was completed by his children. Today, guests can experience a lavish stay and perhaps even a few bumps and creaks in the night. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of the Pfister Hotel! The Moment in Oddity features Lady Wonder the Psychic Horse and This Moment in History features The Ra II Expedition. Our locations was suggested by listener Brad Brancel.</p> <p>This episode sponsored by Best Fiends!
