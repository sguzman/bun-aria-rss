  "description": "Does being an actor prepare you for a life in politics? The answer is... not in the way you might think. Tracy shot to fame playing Tricia Armstrong in Coronation Street and went on to star in EastEnders, Holby City, The Bill, Silent Witness, Casualty and loads more. She's now the Labour MP for Batley and Spen and tells Matt about how she coped campaigning there after Jo Cox's murder and the pressure of being Jo Cox's successor. Tracy is running to be the West Yorkshire Mayor and explains why, after just a few years as an MP she's prepared to leave the Commons behind. This is an invigorating conversation about what politics is really about.
