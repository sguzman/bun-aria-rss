  "description": "<p><p>On Episode 51, the gents start off with some World Series talk as RA and Whits take opposing views about the post-game proposal. They also discuss Crosby's missed empty-netter attempt from center ice that cost RA some shekels and the hideous Team USA jersey before bringing on the always entertaining Colby Armstrong (@armdog). Armdog talks about dressing up as Danaerys for Halloween while live on TV, his NBCSN debut, the sick costumes that NHL players always come up with, what ails the Oil, riding aboard a truck in the Penguins parade, and so much more. There's no way he's going back to the minzies after this ep. The boys then have some laughs as they finish up with #AllRightHamilton questions. Lotta fun once again. Tune in.</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
