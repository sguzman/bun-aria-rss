  "description": "President Trump is knocking down the media’s house of fear. The media went nuts when Trump took off his mask on the White House balcony and told Americans not to let the coronavirus dominate their lives. But Glenn shows that Trump is not the first leader to echo the words of FDR: “We have nothing to fear but fear itself.” Washington Examiner reporter Salena Zito discusses if Joe Biden really is dominating in the polls.
