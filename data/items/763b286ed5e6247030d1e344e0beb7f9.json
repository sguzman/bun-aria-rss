  "description": "<p>Why have we concentrated so intensely in this series on the 300 Spartans at Thermopylae? Because you and I are in a battle too. Like the Spartans, we know the outcome in advance. No miracle will save us. No truce, no negotiation, and certainly no \"victory\" will see us off the field alive. Our question is the same as the Spartans': what are we going to do about it?<br/><br/>New episodes every Monday. SUBSCRIBE wherever you get your podcasts.</p>",
