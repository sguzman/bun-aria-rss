    "media:description": "What on Earth happened to the Arab Christians? Christianity has been in the Middle East for 20 centuries now, but just what does it mean to be an \"Arab Christian\" or \"Christian Arab\"? Does such a designation even exist? In today's video, we'll be discussing some of the history of Islamization and Arabization in the regions of the Levant, Egypt and the Maghreb and how this has affected the demographics and identities of their indigenous Christian population.\n\nThe complex ethno-religious and political situation of the Middle East has been shaped by generations and generations of migrations, conflicts, assimilation and cultural shifts. Arabic-speaking Christians are an often glossed over demographic in the minds of many Americans and Westerners, but they are an important part of the historical and current situation in the region.
