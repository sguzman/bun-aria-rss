  "description": "<p>Corrine Fisher and Joe Derosa came to the studio to talk about the awesome and unique state NYC boozers find themselves in. It's summertime and none of the bars allow indoor seating. So many of them have gone to window service. You can get cocktails, beers, wine, and frozen drinks TO GO! It has turned the entire city into a giant street fair. It's amazing and people are really turning into their alcoholic butterflies.</p>",
