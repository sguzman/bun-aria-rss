The wonderfully warm Dr. Benjamin Karney of the UCLA Marriage lab has been studying romance and intimate relationships for 20 years and sits down to chat about being single and the mechanisms behind finding a partner, what behaviors foster intimacy, why some couples stay together vs. splitting up, some bananas proposals, wedding budgets, how parenting affects marriage, historical problems with matrimony and his own experiences with marriage and divorce. These behaviors are also so applicable to friendships, work partnerships and as it turns out...professional clowns.</p><p>Dr. Ben Karney at the <a href=\"http://marriage.psych.ucla.edu/people.html\" target=\"_blank\">UCLA Marriage Lab</a></p><p>This week's donation was made to <a href=\"https://www.care.org/impact/stories/cares-work-end-gender-based-violence\" target=\"_blank\">Care.org</a>, which works to end gender-based violence.</p><p>Sponsor links: <a href=\"http://TheGreatCourses.com/ologies\" target=\"_blank\">TheGreatCourses.com/ologies</a>, <a href=\"http://Linkedin.com/ologies\" target=\"_blank\">Linkedin.com/ologies</a>, <a href=\"http://TrueandCo.com/ologies\" target=\"_blank\">TrueandCo.com/ologies</a></p><p>More links at <a href=\"http://alieward.com/ologies/matrimoniology\" target=\"_blank\">alieward.com/ologies/matrimoniology</a></p><p>Become a patron of Ologies for as little as a buck a month: <a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/ologies\" target=\"_blank\">www.Patreon.com/ologies</a></p><p><a href=\"http://ologiesmerch.com/\" target=\"_blank\">OlogiesMerch.com</a> has hats, shirts, pins, totes!</p><p>Follow @Ologies on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/ologies\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> or <a href=\"http://instagram.com/ologies\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></p><p>Follow @AlieWard on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/alieward\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> or <a href=\"http://instagram.com/alieward\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></p><p>Sound editing by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stevenRayMorris\" target=\"_blank\">Steven Ray Morris</a> & <a href=\"http://instagram.com/Jarrett_Sleeper\" target=\"_blank\">Jarrett Sleeper</a></p><p>Theme song by Nick Thorburn</p><p><a href=\"http://Patreon.com/ologies\">Support the show: http://Patreon.com/ologies</a></p>\n",
