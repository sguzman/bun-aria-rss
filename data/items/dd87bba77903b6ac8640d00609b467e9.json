  "description": "<p>We're back for another great interview as today we speak with a history making athlete who is the first Australian male athlete to be selected for an Olympics in the sport of sports climbing, Tom O'Halloran! We learn from Tom just how he got into the sport and why he has always had a dream to represent Australia at the Olympic Games. We also learn about the unique year he had in 2020 to even get to Tokyo, why making the Olympics wasn't quite what he expected it to be with the events that followed and just why a story from his childhood may be brought up on Channel Seven during the Olympics should they listen to this interview! It's one insightful and fun chat that you won't want to miss!</p>",
