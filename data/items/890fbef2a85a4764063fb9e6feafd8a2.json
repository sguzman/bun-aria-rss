  "description": "<p>We’re making a big buzz about bees! Our pollen-collecting friends get so much done, and we’re taking a look at how they live. We’ll bust some bee myths and meet some honeybees for a look at life inside the hive. <br>Our mystery sound is from a listener (here’s a hint: they recorded the sound in Alaska!), and our Moment of Um answers a buzzworthy question: Why do beehives look like hexagons? <br>And! One episode on bees just isn’t enough. We’ll be back next week with more buzz on pollination.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Want to hear more about bees?
