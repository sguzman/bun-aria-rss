  "description": "<p>The Oliver House Bed & Breakfast is located in Bisbee, Arizona. Bisbee is a quaint town with a historic mining background. As is the case in most mining towns, this town has a rich history with gambling, prostitution and murder taking center stage. The Bisbee of the modern era may have quieted considerably, but the unseen world has not stopped kicking up its heels. Long dead residents still seem to be hanging around and one of their favorite places to knock about is the Oliver House. Diane and Denise are both under the weather during this podcast and the tail end of the show devolves into weird ghost vocals, a rooster banshee and other fun! Moment in Oddity features the MacKenzie Tomb and This Day in History features the Blood Bath at Vassy.</p> <p>Check out the website:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes along with a link to the Louis Vuitton trunk we mention and our interview on the 9th Story Podcast can be found here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/03/hgb-podcast-31-oliver-house.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/03/hgb-podcast-31-oliver-house.html</a></p>",
