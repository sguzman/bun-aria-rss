  "description": "<p>The gang's all here!!! Avery, Codie & Tony are back together to talk about the violent prelude to the Gettysburg Campaign of 1863; heralded as Lee's greatest victory, The Battle of Chancellorsville within Spotsylvania County, Virgina stands as the fourth bloodiest single battle of the war with nearly 30,000 casualties between Apr. 27-May 6, 1863. The guys sit and analyze the popular stories and misconceptions of the battle, and banter whether or not this engagement at the Chancellorsville crossroads really was Lee's greatest victory or not. Tony regales Avery & Codie about his Disney adventures, Codie keeps his cool as best he can, and Avery probably pisses off the Lost Causer audience as he always does. Strap in for a great episode, Banterers. Enjoy! </p>",
