  "description": "This week on Talking Sopranos Michael and Steve take on one of the most memorable episodes of the Sopranos ever. This one is extra special for Michael because wrote it! Originally it was a spec script he created in between season one and two where Christopher OD’s. David read it, loved it, and thought it would work perfect in an episode where Christopher gets shot. \nThe story is fantastic and there’s lots of inside info as Paulie Walnuts is haunted by ghosts from his past, and a vision of life after death. Didn’t his donations to the church cover all this? In one of the most powerful scenes of the entire series Tony confronts Melfi about his Italian heritage, honor, family and loyalty. As Christopher says to Carmela when she asks about the hospital drugs…It’s pretty f**cking good.  S2 E9 of the Sopranos “From Where to Eternity” takes us to some crazy places. Make sure to check it out and please subscribe to the Talking Sopranos podcast where ever you get your podcasts. Also post questions for Michael and Steve and get your official Talking Sopranos merchandise at talking sopranos.com\n",
