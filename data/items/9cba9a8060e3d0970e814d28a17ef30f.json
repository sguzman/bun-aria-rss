  "description": "In today's podcast we learn that so far Russian influence seems not to be operating in Germany's election. Iran's APT33 turns from spying to sabotage. Equifax woes continue, but don't appear to include cover-up of an earlier breach. UpGuard helps Viacom dodge a cyber bullet. You may be party to a contract you didn’t know about. Criminal boneheads again more common than criminal geniuses. Ben Yelin from UMD CHHS with a story of the FBI raiding the wrong home based on WiFi router information. Guest is Eddie Habibi from PAS, debunking some ICS myths. And don't be a gazelle. \n   Thanks for listening to the CyberWire. One of the ways you can support what we do is by visiting our sponsors. Recorded Future's user conference RFUN 2017 comes to Washington, D.C. , October 4th and 5th, 2017, bringing together the people who put the act in actionable intelligence. If you’d like to learn more about how small nuances in how artificial intelligence and machine learning are used can make a big difference, check out E8’s white paper.",
