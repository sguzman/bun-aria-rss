  "description": "<p>Deep Divers, we are on a JOURNEY this week and you may or may not want to come along. June recounts her trip to Miami and you'll be shocked to learn she took Jessica's styling advice. We're talking gold hoops, six-inch heels, and sugar-free vodka Redbulls by the pool, honey! Then, June issues an apology to Jessica while stating an age-old proverb: \"Maybe she's born with it, or maybe she's wounding her face.\" Finally, we dig into DMs and d*ck pics, and we discover the romance and sexuality of the TV shows Bridgerton and Outlander. Remember Deep Divers, just because you finished the Oregon Trail and did not contract dysentery, we still need to replenish supplies, and sometimes those supplies hurt.  </p><p> </p><p> </p><p>Visit the Pinterest Board <a href=\"http://pinterest.com/thedeepdive\" target=\"_blank\">pinterest.com/thedeepdive</a></p><p>You can follow The Deep Dive on Twitter @thedeepdivepod</p><p>June Diane Raphael @MsJuneDiane on Twitter @junediane on Instagram</p><p>Jessica St. Clair @Jessica_StClair on Twitter @stclairjessica on Instagram</p><p>Check out the Jane Club at <a href=\"http://www.janeclub.com/\" target=\"_blank\">www.janeclub.com</a></p><p>Send us your The Deep Dive theme or any questions you might have to thedeepdive@earwolf.com</p>\n",
