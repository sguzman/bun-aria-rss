  "description": "Cryptocurrency assets are growing at a far faster pace than the internet, according to macroeconomic expert Raoul Pal.\n\nPal is also detailing specific price targets for Bitcoin based on various rates of adoption moving forward.\n\n“Assuming BTC remains one standard deviation below trend it gives a price target of $600,000. If it slows to two standard deviations below trend, then you get a number of around $300,000.\n\nMaybe the regression trend should be taken from 2013 to avoid the very early spike. That gives slower growth and lower targets. That gives trend at $700,000, one standard deviation [above] at $350,000 and two standard deviations at $200,000.”\nLearn more about your ad choices.
