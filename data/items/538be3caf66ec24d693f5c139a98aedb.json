  "description": "Vivek Ramaswamy, a scientist, lawyer, and former venture capitalist and entrepreneur, has a new book out: \"Woke, Inc.: Inside Corporate America's Social Justice Scam\". In this book, he argues that \"wokeism\" has become a way for corporations to wrap themselves in a mantle, which then furthers the idea of crony capitalism and extends their power into spaces they were never meant to be in.\n\nLuigi Zingales and Bethany McLean sit down with Ramaswamy to discuss his perspectives on the role of virtue, ethics, and politics in business and society.",
