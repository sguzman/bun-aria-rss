  "description": "On today's show, Pat is joined by 2x Super Bowl Champion, former Pittsburgh Steelers great, and friend of the show, Ike Taylor. Ike and Pat discuss the Darrelle Revis/Richard Sherman beef, and Ike breaks down the differences in both of their styles, and gives his thoughts on what made Revis so upset with Sherman. Ike also discusses why he thinks the 49ers may be too much for the Chiefs to handle, he chats about the Chiefs weapons and what San Francisco needs to do to defend them, gives his thoughts on whether or not Joe Burrow will have typical rookie struggles when he enters the league, and gives his prediction for the Super Bowl (9:11-24:25). Also joining the show is Super Bowl Champion, former Heisman finalist, and one of the best backup Quarterbacks in the NFL, Chase Daniel. Chase gives his thoughts on the Bears' season this year and why he thinks things didn't go the way they expected. He also touches on Mitchell Trubisky's struggles and why he thinks he was one of the most important elements in keeping the locker room together when things started to go sour for the Bears. Chase also gives his thoughts on the Super Bowl matchup after having a couple of weeks to watch the Chiefs and 49ers play, and gives his thoughts on the futures of Tom Brady and Drew Brees while considering his own options for his next backup role (26:22-40:11). Pat also gives his thoughts on the NFL Draft being in Las Vegas this year and asks his agent if the different locations for the NFL Draft have been a success, how he thinks the logistics will play out with players being driven by boat to a floating red carpet on the Bellagio fountain. Pat also goes to bat for Jimmy G and for those who are saying he is nothing more than a system Quarterback, and breaks down the bench clearing brawl between Kansas and Kansas State that spilled into the crowd and has resulted in some harsh suspensions for each team thus far. Don't forget to send your Super Bowl predictions in with the hashtag #PatIPredict. If you correctly guess, you'll be entered into  a drawing for a chance to win $1,000. Today's episode is fun one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.\n",
