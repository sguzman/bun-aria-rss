  "description": "Each era of the NBA has its transcendent players. The type of players that change the game simply by the manner in which they play, using their extreme talent to force opponents to change their approach. Can Zion Williamson be one of those players? Well, he's certainly on his way. In just his second season, he already has seasoned vets shaking their heads at the sheer talent and confidence he exudes on the court. And this week he sits down with JJ and Tommy and shows why he's just as impressive off the court as he is on it. He opens up about about several personal topics, including his feelings towards all the accolades and praise he has received so far, what it means to be named an all star, dealing with negative comments on social media, his progression as a player, and much more. \n**Note: there is no TOP 5/Draft in this episode. But tune in next week for an extra special draft with two guests that is easily one of the craziest OM3 drafts so far.  \nRUNDOWN\n•\tWhat's it's like to be named an all-star\n•\tDoes he set goals for himself\n•\tDoes he pay attention to the accolades and records that he's set this season\n•\tDid he have any other plans for all-star weekend (dunk contest??)\n•\tHas he spoken to B.I. about not making the ASG\n•\tTalk about players who got snubbed \n•\tDiscusses the improvement in Lonzo Ball's game\n•\tDealing with negative comments on social media\n•\tBreaks down his progression as a player\n•\tTalking some X's and O's about the N.O. offense\n•\tAt what point in high school did he get his handle\n•\tTalk about the viral video of the small kid fouling Zion in HS\n•\tWho are some of the people he has really enjoyed playing against\n•\tHow the superstars can make good defense moot\n•\tWhat parts of his game does he feel needs improvement\n•\tOn working with Fred Vinson on his shot\n•\tLooks back at his 17 in a row against the Spurs in his first game\n•\tDoes he feel the game is different without fans\n•\tHas this season been more fun for him \n•\tIs he following the Top Shot mania right now\n•\tJJ asks Zion about his poetry skills\nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\nLearn more about your ad choices.
