  "description": "<p>August 20, 1989. Beverly Hills, California. Jose and Kitty Menendez were eating ice cream and watching a movie at home when they were shot to death. Their two sons, Lyle (21) and Erik (18) said that they were not home at the time but their behavior following the murders of their parents as well as the investigation into it began to reveal a different story. The two sons had burned through a lot of money buying cars, trips and even a restaurant. After Erik told his psychiatrist, Dr. Jerome Oziel, that he and his brother had killed their parents, Oziel's mistress then told police. Investigators then knew who committed the murders but not why. When the case went to trial, Erik's defense attorney, Leslie Abramson, alleged that Lyle and Erik had endured years of sexual abuse at the hands of their father. It was said that they feared that they would be killed and that was why they shot their parents. Were the murders done out of fear? Or did Lyle and Erik just want their parents' money?</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
