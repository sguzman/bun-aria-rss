Last Call is pretty good:  it&#8217;s full of action and it reads like a cross between Stephen King, Roger Zelazny, and George Pelecanos.  I thought the ending was weak, but, hey, <a href=\"https://statmodeling.stat.columbia.edu/2017/07/28/improved-ending-martian/\">nobody&#8217;s</a> perfect.</p>\n<p>The poker scenes in Last Call were carried out well.  The only problem I had was in some of the exposition near the beginning, where it seemed that the author was regurgitating a bunch of Frank Wallace&#8217;s classic, &#8220;Poker: A guaranteed income for life by using the advanced concepts of poker,&#8221; even to the extent of repeating the anecdote about the sandwich.  Wallace&#8217;s book remains very readable, and I have no problem using it as background, but it&#8217;s gotta be processed first so it doesn&#8217;t look like raw research.</p>\n",
