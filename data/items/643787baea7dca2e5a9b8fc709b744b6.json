(Have you tried her chocolate rugelach? Then you know what we’re talking about.) Jessie’s newest cookbook, <em>The Vintage Baker</em>, is out now and it’s a celebration of the vintage recipe pamphlets she has collected over the years. Jessie didn’t set out to be a baker.

Tune in to hear about her new book, her career pivot, and even her best exercise advice (hint–it involves coffee!).</p>\n<p>Thank you to today’s sponsors:</p>\n<p>Le Cordon Bleu, the legendary culinary school.
