  "description": "Would you give up a day of skydiving to be a guest on our podcast? Major Frank Anello, Marine Forces Special Operations Raider did just that for this episode. <br /><br />“I was 100% sure either the bad guys were going to come back up the mountain and we were going to have a bad firefight or we were going to die of exposure. I was very sure we were in a bad place.” Challenges aren’t just downrange. They can be with a leader you don't agree with or dealing with mental health issues. <br /><br />Hear how these special operators dealt with the mountain top battles and the battles that are on the inside. <br />_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ <br /> <br /> SOFcast is the U.S. Special Operations Command official podcast where we harness the power of storytelling to connect you directly to thought-provoking and unique perspectives from our force. Listen to members of America's elite special operations forces gather to discuss current issues. We believe that leadership is critically important at all levels, throughout every element of SOF and that leadership can be honed through hearing and understanding the trials and triumphs of others. <br />_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________ <br /> <br />#specialoperations #specialforces #military #sof #army #navy #marines #airforce #navyseal #sealteam #frogman #greenberet #ranger #marsoc #operator #tactical #theonlyeasydaywasyesterday #podcast",
