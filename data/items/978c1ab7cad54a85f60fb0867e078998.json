  "description": "<p>This paper introduces high school students to continued fractions and\ndevelops basic properties of Finite Continued Fractions and Infinite Continued\nFractions. This also includes computation of the quadratic number with a given\nperiodic continued fraction, conjugate quadratic numbers, and approximation of\nreals and convergent of continued fractions. Through the study of continued\nfractions, you will gain increased insight into the proper relationships of\nnumber systems that are emphasized in today's modern mathematics courses. I\nbelieve that you will find continued fractions fun to work with.\n</p>",
