  "description": "Rarely has there been a politician as honest, bold, and humble as Nikki Haley. A true role model, she never wanted to be a politician. But as governor, she led South Carolina through one of its worst tragedies. And as ambassador to the U.N., she used her famous “taking names” approach to reclaim America’s strong reputation of leadership. One of the only Trump officials to leave without a tweet, she wasn’t always a Trump fan. But by simply speaking the truth, the two quickly gained a strong trust. Nikki Haley details how she saw firsthand the Deep State’s attempts to circumvent Trump, as well as Trump’s true support for Israel and “soft words, but strong actions” approach to Russia and China. And as for her own future, she’s not done yet.\n\n\nThis Week's Sponsors:\n\nQuip dental products are intentionally designed to make good habits simple.
