  "description": "<p>On today’s show, the guys give an update on the weight loss competition and discuss what the D.O.G. leaderboard is currently looking like, plus chat about The Situation preparing to go to jail on tax evasion charges, the Clemson football team being served McDonald’s at the White House by the President, and a woman in Texas being banned from her local Walmart for drinking wine out of a Pringles can and riding a scooter in the parking lot. Todd wants to know what name the guys would give themselves if they were assassins, and Gorms wants to know what everyone’s first impression of him was as the guys get a little introspective. They also play some Elvis related fact or fiction, answer a few listener questions including what they would do if they were a computer virus, and who they would choose if they could be any cartoon character. To close the show, the guys each give some vitamin thoughts. It’s a fun one, come and have a good time with us.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>This episode features @toddmccomas, @PatMcAfeeShow, @Digz, @nickmaraldo, @tyschmit, @BostonConnr, @HeyGorman, @VivalaZito, @evanfoxy, and closes with “Poor Man Blues,” by Zac Wilkerson</p>\n",
