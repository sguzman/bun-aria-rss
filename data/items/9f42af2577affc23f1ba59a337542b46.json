  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, Speaker Nancy Pelosi is concealing information regarding her culpability for the security breach at the Capitol on January 6th, 2020. Our Congress trashes the Constitutional system and seeks to change the Constitution by appointing radical judges and by legislation, instead of by proposing amendments. The January 6 Committee’s agenda is clear, it’s to prevent Donald Trump from ever serving as President again, it has nothing to do with legislative inquiry. Then, Adam Schiff should be disbarred for his public behavior. But that's not stopping the January 6 Committee from requesting the cooperation of Sean Hannity in their partisan smear job. This is all about politics and the destruction of press freedom so they can eventually define who is a journalist and who isn't. Later, Democrats are trying to win the midterms by redistricting; adding Democrat seats in Republican states. They are also abusing the Civil Rights Division of the US Department of Justice to use litigation to achieve their goal. Afterward, Officer Kim Potter's conviction was excessive, she made a mistake and now she's been denied bail. This case is bigger than Potter's case as this aggressive prosecution of Police Officers presents a larger danger. Lastly, getting rid of the filibuster rule would nullify the need for a Senate as a whole. What is the need for two Senators from each state if debate is removed and mob rule takes over? Democrats push for a majority-rule democracy, not the republic that this country was founded as.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
