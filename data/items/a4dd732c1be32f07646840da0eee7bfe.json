  "description": "This week we’re talking about our experience at Buzzfeed. As a quick refresher, we pitched our show, The Breakdown, to a program called Vertical U that’s run by Instagram and Buzzfeed. Out of over 300 creators, 15 were selected to spend the week at Buzzfeed developing their shows. After the last day of the program, we decided to pick up the mics and recorded our thoughts on the week. \nOn this episode we take you through our experience at Vertical U, we talk about what we learned from the program and what we learned about ourselves from the experience.",
