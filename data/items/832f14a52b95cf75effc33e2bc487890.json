  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys are joined by friend of the show, Matt Hasselbeck, live from the box truck studio in New Orleans. They discuss everything going on in the NFL right now including Daniel Jones getting the starting nod in New York, whether or not Jalen Ramsay is going to be traded, and what Pat and Matt think about Adam Vinatieri's current situation and when he will bounce back, and Matt talks about the mental toughness it takes to be a starting QB in the NFL for a good chunk of time, only to go somewhere else with the intention of being someone's backup QB. Matt also tells a couple of incredible stories from this time in the locker room with guys including Brett Favre, Jerry Rice, Tom Coughlin, and Josh McCown, among others. Today's show is loaded with everything you need to be up to date on going on in the NFL ahead of week 3. It's a good one, come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
