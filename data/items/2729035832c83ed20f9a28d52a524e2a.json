  "description": "What do you think of, when you think of the genre of fantasy?  \n\n\n\nWhether it’s fiction, TV, cinema, or games, are there certain elements you need to have for something to be considered fantasy?  \n\n\n\nWell, you might say fantasy is medieval, or at least set in a time of swords and sorcery.\n\nOr that fantasy has to be epic in scale; there are always grand and noble characters. \n\nOr maybe fantasy has to be set in an imaginary world.\n\nOr, at the very least, there should be some magic.  \n\n\n\nBut, as I explore on this episode. Some, or all, or none of these might be present in a work of fantasy. There's more to fantasy than you might expect.  \n\n\n\nThis week I chat to Dr Gerard Hynes to try to get the core of fantasy. We explore Game of Thrones, Lord of the Rings, and the pop culture behemoth that is fantasy right now. We also look at a hugely diverse array of fantasy that goes far beyond what many people imagine when they think of the genre.\n\n\n\nFor more details, links, and transcripts head to wttepodcast.com\n\n\n\nJoin the WTTE community and support the show on Patreon!",
