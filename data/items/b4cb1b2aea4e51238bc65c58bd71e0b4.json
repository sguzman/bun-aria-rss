  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, the media is cherry-picking and manipulating the transcript of President Trump's conversation with Ukrainian President Zelensky, so this program breaks it down in its entirety. The Department Of Justice and the Federal Election Commission have both reviewed this transcript and agree that there was no violation of federal election law. The truth of the matter is that Joe Biden obstructed justice by blackmailing Ukraine to fire a prosecutor. There was no this-for-that quid pro quo between Trump and Zelensky the way there was with Biden and former Ukrainian President Petro Poroshenko. Then, the very thing they blame Trump for doing was done when three Democrat Senators, Dick Durbin, Patrick Leahy, and Robert Menendez, interfered in Ukrainian investigations by sending an official letter to Ukrainian officials in May of 2018. Later, John Solomon calls in to discuss his reporting on Hunter Biden and the Ukrainian prosecutor and how it was the Democrats that first solicited Ukraine’s help in the 2016 election. Afterward, Fox News Contributor Dan Bongino joins the program to discuss his new book \"Exonerated: The Failed Takedown of President Donald Trump by the Swamp.\"\nLearn more about your ad choices.
