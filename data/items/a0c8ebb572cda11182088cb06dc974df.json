  "description": "<p>In this episode, John makes the case why Tua should play for the Dolphins right now - despite Ryan Fitzpatrick's solid play, and why the Pac-12 coming back for a 6 game season is a joke, explains why he's impressed with the NFL effort level, despite not having fans, and why he thinks Sean Payton knows the Saints could be in big trouble. He also passes along some of the chatter he's hearing from his sources around the league, and gives his 3 for the $ Week 3 ATS picks, and answers listener questions in the Middlekauff Mailbag.
