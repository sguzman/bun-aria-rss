  "description": "Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the life and work of Louis Pasteur (1822-1895) and his extraordinary contribution to medicine and science. It is said few people have saved more lives than Pasteur. A chemist, he showed that otherwise identical molecules could exist as 'left' and 'right-handed' versions and that molecules produced by living things were always left-handed. He proposed a germ theory to replace the idea of spontaneous generation. He discovered that microorganisms cause fermentation and disease. He began the process named after him, pasteurisation, heating liquids to 50-60 C to kill microbes. He saved the beer and wine industries in France when they were struggling with microbial contamination. He saved the French silk industry when he found a way of protecting healthy silkworm eggs from disease. He developed vaccines against anthrax and rabies and helped establish immunology. Many of his ideas were developed further after his lifetime, but one of his legacies was a charitable body, the Pasteur Institute, to continue research into infectious disease.\n\nWith \n\nAndrew Mendelsohn\nReader in the School of History at Queen Mary, University of London\n\nAnne Hardy\nHonorary Professor at the Centre for History in Public Health at the London School of Hygiene and Tropical Medicine\n\nand \n\nMichael Worboys\nEmeritus Professor in the History of Science, Technology and Medicine at the University of Manchester \n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson.",
