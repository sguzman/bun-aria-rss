It’s also the first of its kind to focus on the largely unexplored world of metagenomic proteins.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">This new database could help scientists gain insight into the extraordinary diversity of the natural world and make discoveries that could help cure diseases, clean the environment and produce renewable energy. </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">We hope that sharing the database and the AI model used to create it will fuel further scientific progress in this field and improve our understanding of the world around us.</span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">Learn more about </span><a href=\"https://ai.facebook.com/blog/protein-folding-esmfold-metagenomics/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400\">our AI model</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400\"> and the biological impacts it could have on our planet.</span></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://about.fb.com/news/2022/11/ai-protein-research-could-drive-progress-in-medicine-clean-energy/\">New AI Research Could Drive Progress in Medicine and Clean Energy</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://about.fb.com\">Meta</a>.</p>\n",
