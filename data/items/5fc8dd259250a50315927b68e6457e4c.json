  "description": "<p>Welcome to the first episode in our series on Sophocles’ Greek drama <em><a href= \"https://www.gutenberg.org/ebooks/54543\">Antigone</a></em>. After sharing a little about their background with this play, Angelina, Cindy and Thomas talk about the overall structure and the conventions of Greek Drama and Greek Tragedy. Thomas also gives an overview of the type of characters to expect in Greek Tragedy, and he highlights the ways in which Sophocles changed Greek Drama. Angelina explains the ideas of unity of time, unity of place, and unity of plot as presented by Aristotle. Thomas also summarizes the myth on which this play is based, talks about Creon’s character, and expands on some of the tensions present in <em>Antigone</em>.</p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>You don’t know what ideas my mind-spirit needs right now; I don’t know what your mind-spirit need; and we don’t know the mind-spirit needs of each child in a classroom. Vital ideas are not sold pre-measured in a bottle.</p> <cite>Anne White</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>She had a terror of solitary evenings, all the terror of one who did not care for books, who was soaked in superstition and loved lights and noise.</p> <cite>Hugh Walpole</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>When we are self-conscious, we cannot be wholly aware; we must throw ourselves out first. This throwing ourselves away is the act of creativity. So, when we wholly concentrate, like a child in play, or an artist at work, then we share in the act of creating. We not only escape time, we also escape our self-conscious selves.</p> <p>The Greeks had a word for ultimate self-consciousness which I find illuminating: hubris: pride: pride in the sense of putting oneself in the center of the universe. The strange and terrible thing is that this kind of total self-consciousness invariably ends in self-annihilation. The great tragedians have always understood this, from Sophocles to Shakespeare.</p> <cite>Madeleine L’Engle</cite></blockquote> <h3>A Scot to Jeanne D’Arc</h3> <p><em>by Andrew Lang</em></p> <p>DARK Lily without blame,  <br /> Not upon us the shame,  <br /> Whose sires were to the Auld Alliance true;  <br /> They, by the Maiden’s side,  <br /> Victorious fought and died; <br /> One stood by thee that fiery torment through,  <br /> Till the White Dove from thy pure lips had passed,  <br /> And thou wert with thine own St. Catherine at the last.  </p> <p>Once only didst thou see, <br /> In artist’s imagery, <br /> Thine own face painted, and that precious thing  <br /> Was in an Archer’s hand  <br /> From the leal Northern land.</p> <h3>Book List:</h3> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3xuS2TM\">Ideas Freely Sown</a></em> by Anne White</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2TKL5PP\">The Thirteen Travellers</a></em> by Hugh Walpole</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2SPBmHS\">The Sea Tower</a></em> by Hugh Walpole</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3zJ8ZM3\">A Circle of Quiet</a></em> by Madeleine L’Engle</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3cVPoyE\">The Great Divorce</a></em> by C.
