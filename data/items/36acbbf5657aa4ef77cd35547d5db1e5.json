  "description": "<p>In this episode, I talk about the differences between jealousy and envy and how they relate to other emotions. They both hinge on the thought that you need something external - money, a certain job, a romantic partner, a friend - to be happy and that you will be unhappy without it. Join me today to hear why confidence alone won't solve issues with jealousy.</p> <p>Get full show notes and more information here: <a href= \"https://unfckyourbrain.com/60\">https://unfckyourbrain.com/60</a></p>",
