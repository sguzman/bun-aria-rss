  "description": "Today we’re talking about those things that can be a splurge and don’t have to be, but they just make us so happy. They make life easier and more beautiful. Sue loves linen sheets as they look nice and breathe super well, improving one’s sleep, and we can agree that a good pillow, like the brand called Coop, can go a long way in terms of luxury and comfort. Getting alluring aromas is a pleasure we love to indulge because it’s great to get compliments on how you or your house smells. The bathroom setup is often key to defining luxury in your home where you can have a place to bathe in comfort, and then you want an area that provides you with all the possibilities and necessities in getting ready for the day.<br /><br />Some of Sue’s favorite guilty pleasures 2:18<br />Pillows 4:07<br />Towel warmer and scents 7:07<br />Baths and luffas 13:34<br />Hair and bathroom products 15:09<br />A gorgeous product for the closet 20:17<br />The kitchen 23:15<br />Slippers 26:16<br />Entry dish 29:36<br />Hand knotted rugs, sofa throw, and original art 31:28<br /><br />“I have 2 vanities for my husband and I, both in corners of the bathroom, and then in the middle is a seated area where I can sit and do my makeup in front of a window, and there’s just something about natural light. I can see if I need to pluck my eyebrows, I can see when I need to draw on my eyeliner, if my foundation is right. It just tells the truth, where I feel like you just can’t get it if you’re getting ready in a hotel bathroom and there’s no window in there. So I think a window in a bathroom where you can sit down and get ready is a total luxury.” 19:45<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
