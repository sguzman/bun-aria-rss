  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, WREC Radio Host Ben Ferguson fills in for Mark. President Biden has lots of problems from the border chaos, the botched Afghanistan withdrawal, and the budget reconciliation crisis and CNN is covering all of them to distract from Special Counsel Durham's indictment of Clinton Lawyer Michael Sussman. Then, Members of the FBI did the dirty work of the Clinton Campaign and the Democrat National Committee and did it through a web of lawyers. The media spread the lies that promoted the phony Russian Collusion story peddled by Sussman on behalf of the Clinton campaign and the DNC. Later, John Durham's investigation may lead to Hillary Clinton appearing in front of a grand jury. This investigation may lead as high as officials in the White House and the FBI as well. Afterward, the border chaos continues as all manner of unidentified people including trafficked children and gang members steadily grows. Yet rather than be upset by the Biden-made humanitarian crisis, the White House is investigating the horse-mounted border patrol agents that corralled and grabbed the shirt of a Haitian migrant that crossed the border illegally.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
