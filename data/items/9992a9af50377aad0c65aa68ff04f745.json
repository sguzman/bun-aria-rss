  "description": "The Global Education Effect and Japan: Constructing New Borders and Identification Practices (Routledge, 2020) volume investigates the \"global education effect\"--the impact of global education initiatives on institutional and individual practices and perceptions--with a special focus on the dynamics of border-construction, recognition, subversion, and erasure regarding \"Japan\". The Japanese government's push for global education has taken shape mainly in the form of English-Medium Instruction programs and bringing in international students who actually serve as a foreign workforce to fill the declining labour force. Chapters in this volume draw from education, anthropology, sociology, linguistics, and psychology to examine the ways in which demographic changes, economic concerns, race politics, and nationhood intersect with the efforts to \"globalize\" education and create specific \"global education effects\" in the Japanese archipelago. This book will provide a valuable resource for anyone who is interested in Japanese studies and global education.\nJingyi Li is a PhD Candidate in Japanese History at the University of Arizona. She researches about early modern Japan, literati, and commercial publishing.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
