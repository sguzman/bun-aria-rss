OpIsrael hacktivists are expected back this weekend. More on below-the-belt selfies. Prof. Awais Rashid from University of Bristol on training people to work with cyber security complexity at scale. Guest is Hank Thomas from Strategic Cyber Ventures on the current environment for VC funding in cyber security.\n For links to all of today's stories check our our CyberWire daily news brief:\n  https://thecyberwire.com/issues/issues2019/April/CyberWire_2019_04_02.html \n Support our show",
