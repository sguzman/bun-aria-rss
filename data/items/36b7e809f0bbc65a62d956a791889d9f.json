  "itunes:summary": "Transience, improvisation and collaboration form the basis of Dylan Martorell’s music-based art practice. Housed within the conceptual framework of a musical diaspora, his work is drawn to ways in which music travels through space and is affected by changes in geography, climate, culture and materials to become an agent for cross-cultural reciprocation.\n\nPublished on Disclaimer are a series of music scores using the growth structures of plants found within the City of Yarra and the City of Moreland. Here, Dylan talks through the processes, techniques and concepts behind these scores that form the basis of a series of sound recordings and interactive walking maps.\n\nhttps://disclaimer.org.au/contents/sonaflora-drift-scores\n\nImage: Dylan Martorell\n\nFinancial support from patrons at any level has a resounding impact on our work. You can support Liquid Architecture’s weekly podcast and our online journal Disclaimer, for new thinking and writing on listening and sound through a Patreon subscription, for as little as $5 a month.\n \nhttps://www.patreon.com/liquidarchitecture\n\nFor the past 20 years, Liquid Architecture has been Australia’s leading organisation for artists working with sound and listening. LA investigates the sounds themselves, but also the ideas communicated about, and the meaning of, sound and listening.",
