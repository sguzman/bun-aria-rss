  "description": "<p>On a Columbus Day Holiday, Charlie records a special episode just for his podcast listeners, diving headlong into some of the most censored thought crimes in all of media and social platforms. Charlie explains Florida Surgeon General Dr. Ladapo's new vaccine recommendation, advising young men from 18-39 NOT to take the vaccine due to an 84% increase in cardiac related death. Charlie dives into the statistics, including other countries that are advising against young men taking the shot like Denmark, Norway, and now even Australia, and contrasts that with the rest of America. Also, what can we make of excess mortality rates that have been reported in some of the most vaccinated countries? Charlie then documents the story of Illinois Rep. Sean Casten who tragically lost a daughter in her sleep from a cardiac arrhythmia. Why is it he felt compelled to mention his daughter's vaccine status in his statement following her death? Finally, Chalie dives into some of the most intriguing midterm races that are shaping up to be big surprises come November 8. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.charliekirk.com/support\" rel=\"payment\">Support the show: http://www.charliekirk.com/support</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
