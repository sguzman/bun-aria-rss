  "description": "<p class=\"\" data-pm-slice=\"0 0 []\">Meredith and Kaytee are chatting this week with a very special guest! She is the person that has been MOST requested as a guest on our show, and she’s here! Anne Bogel, creator of Modern Mrs. Darcy and What Should I Read Next, and general, all-around amazing lady, is chatting with us today and we couldn’t be more excited.</p> <p class=\"\">You’ll hear a “bookish moment of the week” from all three of us: two are very similar in that they involve bookish friendships, and one is a library-related book demerit (a la Gretchen Rubin on the Happier podcast).</p> <p class=\"\">Next, we discuss our current reads for the week. Two titles from each host, and we are bringing a wide range of books, from romance to thrillers, to interesting writing styles, to weirdo books. It’s all here!</p> <p class=\"\">We’ve got an update for you on our Slow But Steady reads and what’s been happening in the past week, as well as a fun update from a listener.</p> <p class=\"\">For our deep dive this week, we are chatting all things Anne Bogel. You’ll hear about the advice she would have given herself before Episode 1 of What Should I Read Next (now that she’s 200+ episodes in), you’ll hear about her new book coming out next year, and a bit of behind the scenes talk about giving book recs on the fly.</p> <p class=\"\">Finally, this week, we are Pressing Books into Your Hands. And we know you cannot wait to see what Anne chose as her press! We’ve got a novella for every reader who loves books about books, the beginning of a new (old) mystery series, and a summer read that we’ve gushed about in previous episodes.</p> <p class=\"\">As per usual, time-stamped show notes are below with references to every book and resource we mentioned in this episode. If you’d like to listen first and not spoil the surprise, don’t scroll down! </p> <p class=\"\">.</p> <p class=\"\">.</p> <p class=\"\">.</p> <p class=\"\">.</p> <p class=\"\">.</p> <p class=\"\">1:12 - <a href= \"https://www.patreon.com/whatshouldireadnext\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">What Should I Read Next</a> podcast</p> <p class=\"\">1:15 - <a href= \"https://modernmrsdarcy.com/onegreatbook/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">One Great Book</a> podcast</p> <p class=\"\">2:16 - <a href= \"https://modernmrsdarcy.com/200-episode/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">200th Episode</a> of <a href= \"https://modernmrsdarcy.com/what-should-i-read-next/\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">What Should I Read Next</a></p> <p class=\"\">9:06 - <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2NtXpPa\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Whisper Man</a> by Alex North</p> <p class=\"\">13:35 - <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2NeNDB6\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Bromance Book Club</a> by Lyssa Kay Adams</p> <p class=\"\">15:32 - <a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/hotdudesreading/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Hot Dudes Reading</a> on Instagram</p> <p class=\"\">15:45 - <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2ZKxAkv\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Chain</a> by Adrian McKinty</p> <p class=\"\">18:14 - <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2pBRNoO\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Fierce Kingdom</a> by Gin Phillips</p> <p class=\"\">19:00 - <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2POjhHS\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ask Again, Yes</a> by Mary Beth Keane</p> <p class=\"\">19:25 - <a href=\"https://amzn.to/30e94EK\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Girl Before</a> by JP Delaney</p> <p class=\"\">19:36 - <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Zi6RaA\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Lock Every Door</a> by Riley Sager</p> <p class=\"\">21:50 - <a href=\"https://amzn.to/31kf93v\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">One Day</a> by David Nicholls</p> <p class=\"\">25:36 - <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Luzw8H\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Convenience Store Woman</a> by Sayaka Murata</p> <p class=\"\">27:52 - <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2zUkUJ8\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A Better Man</a> by Louise Penny</p> <p class=\"\">32:08 - <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2LkTJOJ\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A Trick of the Light</a> by Louise Penny</p> <p class=\"\">33:03 - <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2EQzKnh\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Hannah Coulter</a> by Wendell Berry</p> <p class=\"\">33:32 - <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2OQ48Sn\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">North and South</a> by Elizabeth Gaskell</p> <p class=\"\">33:43 - <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2ZjsCah\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">On Writing</a> by Stephen King</p> <p class=\"\">34:46 - <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2LVbOEi\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kitchens of the Great Midwest</a> by J.
