    "media:description": "The Jewish concept of a Messiah, or Mashiach in Hebrew, has been discussed extensively by rabbis, philosophers, poets and even featured in Jewish prayer. \n\nHowever, much like many other Jewish concepts, there are debates amongst Jews over what a messianic era is, how or when it will come about and how to help the Messiah arrive. \nDespite these debates, the belief in Mashiach is a fundamental ideal that has been passed down for generations and has created a cohesive peoplehood of Jews, bonded over a shared history and belief of a shared, peaceful future. \n\nThis series is part of a partnership with the Z3 Project.

This series raises crucial questions about peoplehood, Jewish identity, education and community, challenging anyone who’s curious to think about them deeply. We take a look into buzzword Jewish concepts like shabbat, Tikkun Olam, and more.\n\nAbout Unpacked: We provide nuanced insights by unpacking all things Jewish. People are complex and complicated — yet we’re constantly being pushed to oversimplify our world. At Unpacked we know that being complex makes us more interesting. Because of this, we break the world down with nuance and insight to drive your curiosity and challenge your thinking.\n\n#Peoplehood #Messiah #TikkunOlam",
