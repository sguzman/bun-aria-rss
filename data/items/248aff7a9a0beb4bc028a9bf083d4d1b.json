We also talk about how to communicate with people with whom we disagree; how to strategically divest from people and technologies that are depleting us (rather than self-medicating with distraction); and why the most important way to play a constructive role right now — although this may be counterintuitive for some people — is to start with yourself.\nWhere to find Lama Rod Owens online: \nWebsite: https://www.lamarod.com\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/LamaRod1\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/lamarod/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/lamarodowens/\nBook Mentioned: Love and Rage: The Path of Liberation Through Anger by Lama Rod Owens https://bookshop.org/books/love-and-rage-the-path-of-liberation-through-anger-9781623174095/9781623174095\nFull Shownotes: https://www.tenpercent.com/podcast-episode/lama-rod-314\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
