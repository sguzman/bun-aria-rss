  "description": "Adam and Dr. Drew open the show discussing Drew's recent trip to Culver City and his astonishment at the state of things as simple as the public roadways. They also turn to the phones and speak to a caller who is a recovering alcoholic and wants Drew's take on what we should expect when the next virus comes our way. Adam also disgusts Dr. Drew with his favorite recent clip of Los Angeles County Department of Public Health Director Barbara Ferrer explaining how she isn't ready to give up and let people die. As the show wraps up the guys turn back to the phones and speak to a caller with questions about marijuana and another who is wondering when she can expect a negative covid test. \n\nPlease Support Our Sponsors:\nSimpliSafe.com/ADAM2\nTenThousand.cc/ADS\nBabbel.com/ADS\nGeico.com\nPluto.TV",
