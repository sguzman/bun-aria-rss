  "description": "<p>We have carried out a comprehensive study of the temperature structure of\nplasmoids, which successively occurred in recurrent active region jets. The\nmultithermal plasmoids were seen to be travelling along the multi-threaded\nspire as well as at the footpoint region in the EUV/UV images recorded by the\nAtmospheric Imaging Assembly (AIA). The Differential Emission Measure (DEM)\nanalysis was performed using EUV AIA images, and the high-temperature part of\nthe DEM was constrained by combining X-ray images from the X-ray telescope\n(XRT/Hinode). We observed a systematic rise and fall in brightness, electron\nnumber densities and the peak temperatures of the spire plasmoid during its\npropagation along the jet. The plasmoids at the footpoint (FPs) (1.0-2.5 MK)\nand plasmoids at the spire (SPs) (1.0-2.24 MK) were found to have similar peak\ntemperatures, whereas the FPs have higher DEM weighted temperatures (2.2-5.7\nMK) than the SPs (1.3-3.0 MK). A lower limit to the electron number densities\nof plasmoids - SPs (FPs) were obtained that ranged between\n3.4-6.1$\\times$10$^{8}$ (3.3-5.9$\\times$10$^{8}$) cm$^{-3}$ whereas for the\nspire, it ranged from 2.6-3.2$\\times$10$^{8}$ cm$^{-3}$. Our analysis shows\nthat the emission of these plasmoids starts close to the base of the jet(s),\nwhere we believe that a strong current interface is formed. This suggests that\nthe blobs are plasmoids induced by a tearing-mode instability.\n</p>",
