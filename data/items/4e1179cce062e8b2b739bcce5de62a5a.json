  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, capitalism and a republican form of government will solve this coronavirus health crisis. Americans owe a debt of gratitude to those in the CDC, NIH, the school system, and major corporations that have adjusted to make the best of a challenging situation. These people have done their jobs and the President and Vice President are doing their jobs. The media continues to politicize this outbreak. People falling ill to the coronavirus are not sick because of Trump as the media suggests. The truth is that private labs and government researchers are working night and day to solve this problem and they deserve a word of praise for trying to keep us safe and help those that are sick. Then, Bernie Sanders is un-American, he attacks billionaire's for attempting to help find a cure, yet Bill Gates has done more to fight the Coronavirus than Bernie has. Others in Congress like Chuck Schumer and Nancy Pelosi continue to trash the President. Later, Bernie Sanders white-washes his anti-Semitic comments about Israel and takes jabs at Benjamin Netanyahu making the case for Jewish support for his campaign.​\nLearn more about your ad choices.
