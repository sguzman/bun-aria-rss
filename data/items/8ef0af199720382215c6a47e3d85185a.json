  "description": "\"Our time is the age of postmodernity and of the clash of epochs. But a new age of humanity is rising. It is evolutionity or the evolutionary epoch which replaces modernity and postmodernity.\" Such is the powerful argument of W. Julian Korab-Karpowicz in his book Tractatus Politico-Philosophicus: New Directions for the Future Development of Humankind (Routledge, 2017). Within this major paradigm shift that is underway, many fundamental principles about the world will either have to be deeply questioned or reaffirmed in the case of those virtues that have been long forgotten. The ultimate goal will be the further development of humanity into a more \"happy society\".\nW. Julian Korab-Karpowicz is a philosopher and political theorist. He is considered one of the most renowned intellectuals in his native Poland. He received his doctorate at the University of Oxford. In the early 1980's, he was a student leader in Poland's Solidarity movement, and was then awarded a scholarship of the Leadership Development Office of the Presbyterian Church (USA). He is the author of five books, including On the History of Political Philosophy (Routledge, 2016). \nLearn more about your ad choices.
