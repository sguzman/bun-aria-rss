  "description": "<p>Well, Bennifer is back and so is another one of our nostalgic movie rewatch podcasts! In this episode of HDWGW, we take a deep dive into the universally panned 2003 J Lo and Ben Affleck film \"Gigli\" and believe us when we say this film is best digested in small doses. Listen to Jonah and Vanessa break down this singularly terrible film where bad accents, nonsensical character arcs and an flimsy-yet-offensive plot all come together to create a film that was physically difficult to watch and leaves us far more confused than entertained. If you haven't seen \"Gigli\" you'll still enjoy this episode—and as a bonus, we also saved you two hours of your life that would be better spent doing almost anything. </p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
