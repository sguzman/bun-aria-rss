  "description": "Bob Mionske is a Portland, Oregon based attorney whose practice focuses on representing cyclists. He gained his cycling experience at the highest levels, riding twice as a member of the United States Olympic racing team in 1988 and 1992. Mionske was inspired to write Bicycling and the Law: Your Rights as a Cyclist (VeloPress 2007) when he realized that a popular commentary on cycling laws had not been published for over a hundred years. In the podcast Mionske discusses how early bicyclists like 19th century bicycle entrepreneur Albert Pope, established bike friendly rights of the road through protests, legislation, and litigation. Mionske also discusses common issues faced by modern cyclists and offers tips for reaching out to people who are biased against cyclists.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
