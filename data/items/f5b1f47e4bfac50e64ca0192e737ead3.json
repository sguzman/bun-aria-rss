  "description": "Offering a fresh perspective, this timely book analyzes the socio-cultural and physical production of planned capital cities through the theoretical lens of feminism. \nIn Trophy Cities: A Feminist Perspective on New Capitals (Edward Elgar, 2021), Dorina Pojani evaluates the historical, spatial and symbolic manifestations of new capital cities, as well as the everyday experiences of those living there, to shed light on planning processes, outcomes and contemporary planning issues. Chapters explore seven geographically, culturally and temporally diverse capital cities across Australia, India, Brazil, Nigeria, Kazakhstan, Myanmar and South Korea. Pojani argues that new capital cities have embodied patriarchal systems to govern their respective polities which has magnified problems in these cities.

This book will be an invigorating read for urban studies and planning scholars. The information about the processes of new city formation will also be of great use to urban planner\nAccess more of Dorina's publications via her researcher profile.\nIngrid Bailey is a PhD candidate in geography at the University of Queensland.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
