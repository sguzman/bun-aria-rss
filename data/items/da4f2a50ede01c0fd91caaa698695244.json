  "description": "In November 2016, a mother of 2 from Northern California doesn't come home after her usual jog. Her husband tracks her cell phone only to find that it's located in a patch of grass with the headphones placed on top along with strands of blonde hair, but she is nowhere in sight. After a few weeks of searching, she turns up alive in the early hours of Thanksgiving morning- but incredibly injured. As police try to find her abductors, the investigators begin to see holes in her story, making them wonder what really happened to her.
