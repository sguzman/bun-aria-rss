The city is so much more than just a hub for football even though it is nicknamed \"Titletown.\" This is a city influenced by many cultures from the early Native Americans that were here first to the French to the British to the Dutch to the Irish and to the Belgians. Their burial places and businesses and homes all seem to be touched by an essence of the supernatural. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of Green Bay, Wisconsin.
