  "description": "<p>If you haven’t been living under a rock, you’ve likely seen headlines about the tumultuous atmosphere on many college campuses in the United States, which primarily centers around what is and isn’t okay to say or express. The interesting thing is that not too long ago, it was the students who were protesting against the administration placing controls on free speech. But a few years ago, my guest noticed that things had gotten flipped: the students had started protesting that administrators weren't doing enough to limit speech. What happened?</p><p>Well, my guest explores the answer to that question in a book he co-authored with Jonathan Haidt entitled <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B076NVFT5P/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B076NVFT5P&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Coddling of the American Mind: How Good Intentions and Bad Ideas Are Setting Up a Generation for Failure</em></a><em>.</em> His name is Greg Lukianoff and he’s the president of the Foundation for Individual Rights in Education. Today on the show, Greg tries to explain what’s going on on college campuses with the trigger warnings, microaggressions, protests, and sometimes violent clashes between social justice warriors and far-right provocateurs. He argues that there are 3 great untruths that have become woven into childhood and education that are leading the rising generation astray. Greg gets into where these untruths come from and how they're creating a culture of \"safetyism\" that's not only affecting intellectual discourse but the normal process of maturation.</p><p>If you’re looking for some thoughtful, non-polemical insights about some of the craziness you see going on at college campuses, this episode is for you.</p><p>Get the show notes at <a href=\"http://aom.is/coddling\" target=\"_blank\">aom.is/coddling</a>.</p>\n",
