  "description": "The familiar theme of detachment runs right through all three of our readings for this week. Paul tells the Corinthians who are married to carry on as though they were not married and those who buy and sell as though they were not buying and selling.

This detachment is, I argue, the conversion that Jesus speaks of in his inaugural address, which is our Gospel for today.",
