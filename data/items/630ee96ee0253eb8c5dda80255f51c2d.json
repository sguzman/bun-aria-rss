  "description": "<p>Today, we're speaking with one of the co-founders of Charlap Hyman & Herrero, Andre Herrero.</p> <p>Andre received his architectural training at the Rhode Island School of Design, graduating with a degree in Fine Arts and a degree in Architecture in 2012. He then went to the UK, working for David Chipperfield Architects in London. He then worked for SANAA in Tokyo and SO-IL in New York before co-founding his practice with Adam Charlap Hyman in 2015.</p> <p>As a principal of Charlap Hyman & Herrero, Andre leads a multi-disciplinary practice based both in Los Angeles and New York. They work in various typologies - including buildings, products, set designs, stores, and interiors with the aim to create spaces that become worlds in and of themselves.</p> <p>In 2018, Andre was ranked among Forbes Magazine's 30 under 30 in their Art and Style category, and in 2020, their firm won the AIA LA Emerging Practice Award.</p> <p>In this conversation, Andre and I discuss how they have grown their practice, how they have gone to new sectors and opened new product lines, and how they are running a bicoastal firm.</p> <p> </p> <p>► Subscribe to my YouTube Channel for updates:</p> <p><a href= \"https://www.youtube.com/c/BusinessofArchitecture\">https://www.youtube.com/c/BusinessofArchitecture</a></p> <p>*******</p> <p>For more free tools and resources for running a profitable, impactful, and fulfilling practice, connect with me on:<br /> Facebook: <a href= \"https://www.facebook.com/groups/businessofarchitecture\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/businessofarchitecture</a><br />  Instagram: <a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/enoch.sears/\">https://www.instagram.com/enoch.sears/</a><br />  Website: <a href= \"https://www.businessofarchitecture.com/\">https://www.businessofarchitecture.com/</a><br />  Twitter: <a href= \"https://twitter.com/BusinessofArch\">https://twitter.com/BusinessofArch</a><br />  Podcast: <a href= \"http://www.businessofarchitecture.com/podcast/\">http://www.businessofarchitecture.com/podcast/</a><br />  iTunes: <a href= \"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/business-architecture-podcast/id588987926\"> https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/business-architecture-podcast/id588987926</a><br />  Android Podcast Feed: <a href= \"http://feeds.feedburner.com/BusinessofArchitecture-podcast\">http://feeds.feedburner.com/BusinessofArchitecture-podcast</a></p> <p>*******</p> <p>Access the FREE Architecture Firm Profit Map video here: <a href=\"http://freearchitectgift.com\">http://freearchitectgift.com</a></p> <p>Download the FREE Architecture Firm Marketing Process Flowchart video here: <a href= \"http://freearchitectgift.com\">http://freearchitectgift.com</a></p> <p>Come to my next live, in-person event: <a href= \"https://www.businessofarchitecture.com/live\">https://www.businessofarchitecture.com/live</a></p> <p>Carpe Diem!</p>",
