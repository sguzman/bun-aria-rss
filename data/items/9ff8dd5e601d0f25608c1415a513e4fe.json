Dry Farms is a wine supplier that pairs organic, biodynamic, low-sugar, low-alcohol wines from all over the world with customers that share their love for organic, naturally and traditionally made wines. We love them because their wine is delicious, unfussy, and oh-so-good.  Check out more about Dry Farms in the show notes.<b><br/><br/>Toups & Co </b>is your one-stop-shop for all-natural and organic skincare and makeup! Visit their site at toupsandco.com to enjoy their line of serums, soaps, lotions, shampoo bars, mineral makeup, lipstick, and more! Use code HOMEMAKER for a discount! <b><br/><br/>www.jovialfoods.com</b><br/>Jovial Foods is an amazing company, run by husband and wife team Carla and Rodolfo. After they discovered years ago that their daughter had gluten sensitivity, they struck out to find grains that her body could easily digest and thrive off eating - and that led them to einkorn. Einkorn is an ancient variety of wheat - the oldest we know of - that our bodies flourish off of because of its high protein and extremely weak gluten. Now, Jovial Foods is the top supplier of einkorn flours, einkorn pastas, Italian olive oils, prepackaged einkorn snacks, and the top-rated gluten-free pasta line. I’ve hardly met anyone in my life more intent on quality ingredients and quality products than Carla - I continually fall in love with the quality of these products (especially that buttery, rich, einkorn flour that I use to bake everything with!). You must try this flour! It’ll change your baking life. <br/><b><br/>Our love comment this week is from:  NourishedMinds<br/></b><em>Thank you for staying in your lane! Let me just say! It is such a RELIEF to be around two women who are wise, hilarious, and have many insightful things to say. The two of you always make me think twice about my day, my attitude, and even yesterday I made a few changes in my home per your podcast. Thank you for sticking to what you set out to do because I don’t know how much more I can take of today’s media and what’s being thrown at us left and right (no pun intended). You two are such a HEALTHY brake from today’s world. The media takes up my mental space and then I am not at my best for my family and the two of you clear a healthy space for me to set out to do what I need to. Thank you so much. You’re on point, in your element, in your zone, and I will kindly ask that you don’t do anything different!!!</em></p><p><br/><br/></p><p><br/><br/></p>",
