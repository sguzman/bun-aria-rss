  "description": "<p><p>KFC & Feits discuss the state of the podcasting game and how Spotify is throwing around big money. John is frustrated with history books and home economics. Does money buy happiness? Do the White Walkers win? Voicemails include: swimming under a tsunami, eating a hot pocket in the shower, where do you wear a towel, live for 24 more hours or 20,000 more years.</p><p>Ochocinco (57:34) joins the program to tell us that he was a virgin until he was 27, how his stats are the same as Michael Irvin and he deserves to be in the HOF, offers to play with Josh Allen for free, andÂ expresses his lover for Peaky Blinders and Tommy Shelby. Gary Vaynerchuk (1:14:51) pops on with Geronimo Allison. Gary thinks Adam Gase will dominate the division, John does not. Gary also considers buying the Mets with KFC and calls Tom Brady a dickface.</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
