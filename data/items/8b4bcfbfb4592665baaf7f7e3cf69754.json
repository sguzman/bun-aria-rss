  "description": "Author Marc Eliot has written a new biography of country music icon, Merle Haggard. <em>The Hag</em> details Haggard's quite extraordinary life; from breaking into a restaurant (that turned out to be open) and subsequent jail time to his many broken marriages and everything in between. Haggard turned his past failures into songs, writing and singing about his inner turmoil. Eliot told NPR's Steve Inskeep that he thinks the Hag deserves a little more respect: \"I think if he were played on the same radio stations that, say, play Frank Sinatra ... he'd be just as accepted. I think he was that good.\"",
