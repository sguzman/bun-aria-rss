Later, the guys talk about a transgender-related assault case out of Loudoun County, Virginia. As the show wraps up, the guys talk about Dave Chappelle's new special, the media continuing to only cover part of the story, and Sanjay Gupta's 'safe harbor' interview with Don Lemon. \n\nPlease Support Our Sponsors:\nRockAuto.com\nMasterworks.io/Doubt\nGeico.com",
