People have been wrestling with how to live an awakened life for millenia. One of the clearest, deepest, and most practical answers to this profoundly human question is a yogic text that is over 2,500 years old. It’s called the Bhagavad Gita.\"</em></p> <p>About: <strong>Eric Klein & Devi Bliss</strong> are ordained lineage holders in the Kriya Yoga lineage.
