  "description": "The liberals circle the wagons to defend Fetterman. CNN's Dr. Sanjay Gupta brought a visual model on CNN to help explain John Fetterman's stroke. Joe Biden said his son \"lost his life in Iraq.\" He actually died six years after he left Iraq in Maryland of brain cancer. This is either an intentional lie or yet more evidence Biden’s dementia getting worse every day. This isn’t a minor slipup. Democrats plan to subpoena Donald Trump for January 6th hearings. Biden lying about family tragedy is nothing new.<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
