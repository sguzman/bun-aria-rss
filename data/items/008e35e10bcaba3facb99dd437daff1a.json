  "description": "Yes, you know him from The Office, but Rainn Wilson has an inspiring career that not only extends well past that show, but has even evolved past just being an actor. He founded SoulPancake, an incredible platform that creates content celebrating creativity and exploring life’s big questions. And on this episode of Impact Theory with Tom Bilyeu, Rainn Wilson takes on some of the biggest questions we face as a society today--a mental health crisis that is disproportionately harming younger people, climate change, and an epidemic of loneliness that has only gotten worse with the pandemic. He discusses how therapy helped him deal with severe anxiety, talks about why service to others is so important, and advocates looking at the data on big issues like global warming.
