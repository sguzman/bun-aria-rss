  "description": "Today’s podcast is a little unusual. There’s no guest. There’s no educational segment with Daniel. The reason for this change in format is because I tested positive for COVID-19. I share how my family and I are doing… what the testing and recovery process is like… and—of course—all the recent data on the virus and the vaccine. Then, with rumors of another government stimulus package in the news, I explain why these measures are a far cry from the 2008 financial crisis bailout. It's time for politicians to stop talking and start taking action. Finally, I answer a few questions ranging in topic from uranium stocks… to my beloved Philadelphia Eagles… to a few things you might not know about me.   Enjoyed this episode?
