    "media:description": "Series and Parallel Circuits | Electricity | Physics | FuseSchool\n\nThere are two main types of electrical circuit: series and parallel.\n\nIn a series circuit the components are connected end-to-end, one after the other.They make a simple loop for the current to flow round.\n\nIn a parallel circuit the components are connected side by side, so the current divides, some going one way and the rest the other way.\n\nWatch this video to see the examples.\n\n\n\nCREDITS\nAnimation & Design: Bing Rijper\nNarration: Dale Bennette\nScript: Bethan Parry\n\nSUPPORT US ON PATREON\nhttps://www.patreon.com/fuseschool\n\nSUBSCRIBE to the FuseSchool YouTube channel for many more educational videos.
