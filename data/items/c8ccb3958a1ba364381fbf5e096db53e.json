  "description": "Doree Shafrir, a writer at BuzzFeed News and the author of \"Startup: A Novel,\" talks with Recode's Peter Kafka about updating the coming-of-age-in-New-York story for the modern media scene, where working at a print magazine is not the holy grail. \"Startup\" satirizes what happens when a tech reporter uncovers a scandal involving the 28-year-old CEO of a mindfulness app. Shafrir says one of the weirdest ways she has promoted \"Startup\" is on \"Matt and Doree's Eggcellent Adventure,\" a podcast about in vitro fertilization she hosts with her husband, Matt Mira. She also talks about working at the New York Observer under Jared Kushner and at Gawker when it was a largely obscure, New York-specific website.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
