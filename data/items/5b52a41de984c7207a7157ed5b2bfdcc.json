  "description": "I was playing around with D3 last night and built a silly visualization of antipodes and how our intuitive understanding of the world sometimes doesn't make sense. Check out the visualization at bl.ocks.org!\nBasically the idea is if you fly from Beijing to Buenos Aires then you can have a layover at any point of the Earth's surface and it won't make the trip longer."
