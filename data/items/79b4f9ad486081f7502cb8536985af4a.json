  "description": "<p>This week, we stagger down a path of wasted opportunities, and squandered goodwill, with a man who came from a very unstable background to be the best pitcher in his league at one point. He was well liked, and quiet, but that may have just been because he was a few too many pills to be any other way. You root for him, and he disappoints at every turn. It's a sad but hilarious tale of a big fall from grace, including maybe the strangest reason that an athlete has ever missed a game!!<br>Be abandoned by your parents, reach your goals, then get busted with drugs as many times as you possibly can with Lamarr Hoyt!!<br>Check us out, every Tuesday.
