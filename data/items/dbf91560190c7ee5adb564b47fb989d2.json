    "media:description": "It was a dream come true being on the show, regardless of how short my time was.. The fact that thousands of people apply each year, and I got to be a part of this years cast.. Was truly a blessing.  Being the first transgender houseguest was an honour. I left my mark, and I'm so grateful to be a part of the Big Brother Canada family. \n\n#bigbrotherca #bbcan9 #bigbrother\n\n\nINSTAGRAM - http://www.instagram.com/missjulievu\nFACEBOOK - http://www.facebook.com/PrincessJoules\nTWITTER - http://www.twitter.com/PrincessJoules\nSNAPCHAT - princessjoules\n\n*COUPON CODES*\n\n\n\n\n*BUSINESS INQUIRIES: princessbusiness@hotmail.com*",
