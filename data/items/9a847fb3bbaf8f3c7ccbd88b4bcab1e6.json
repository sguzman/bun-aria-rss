The S&P 500&#8217;s performance over the course of 2022 is a great example.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Throughout the year, inflation rates have remained high and interest rates have likewise been climbing around the world. Accompanied by the looming threat of a <a href=\"https://www.visualcapitalist.com/recessions-everything-you-need-to-know/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">recession</a>, some sectors have been hit harder than others.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The above visualization from <strong>Jan Varsava</strong> shows U.S. dividend-adjusted stock performance for each company in the <a href=\"https://www.spglobal.com/spdji/en/index-family/equity/us-equity/sp-sectors/#indices\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">S&P 500 index</a> in 2022, from the start of the year through the end of September.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>S&P 500 Performance (Jan 1 to Sep 30, 2022)</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>In 2022, the S&P 500 index dropped <strong>-23.9% </strong>through the end of September. Let&#8217;s take a look at some of the major trends from this year&#8217;s stock market.</p>\n\n\n\n<table id=\"tablepress-2643\" class=\"tablepress tablepress-id-2643\">\n<thead>\n<tr class=\"row-1 odd\">\n\t<th class=\"column-1\">S&P 500 Sector Performance</th><th class=\"column-2\">2022 Q1–Q3</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody class=\"row-hover\">\n<tr class=\"row-2 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">Energy</td><td class=\"column-2\">+30.71%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-3 odd\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">Utilities</td><td class=\"column-2\">-8.58%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-4 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">Consumer Staples</td><td class=\"column-2\">-13.52%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-5 odd\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">Health Care</td><td class=\"column-2\">-14.15%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-6 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">Industrials</td><td class=\"column-2\">-21.72%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-7 odd\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">Financials</td><td class=\"column-2\">-22.41%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-8 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">Basic Materials</td><td class=\"column-2\">-24.90%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-9 odd\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">Consumer Cyclical</td><td class=\"column-2\">-30.32%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-10 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">Real Estate</td><td class=\"column-2\">-30.43%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-11 odd\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">Technology</td><td class=\"column-2\">-31.93%</td>\n</tr>\n<tr class=\"row-12 even\">\n\t<td class=\"column-1\">Communication Services</td><td class=\"column-2\">-39.43%</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<!-- #tablepress-2643 from cache -->\n\n\n\n<h2>Winners</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>The energy sector has been the noticeable standout and performed significantly well since the beginning of the year, as sanctions surrounding Russia impacted oil and gas supplies resulting in sharp price increases.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Top performing energy stocks as of September 30th, 2022 included Occidental Petroleum (OXY) up <strong>112%</strong> year to date (YTD), and Marathon Petroleum (MPC) which rose <strong>52% </strong>YTD<strong>.</strong></p>\n\n\n\n<p>Traditional defensive sectors such as healthcare, consumer staples, and utilities, although down for the year, also performed better than the overall index.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Losers</h2>\n\n\n\n<p>Growth stocks in both technology and communication services underperformed since the beginning of this year, as the value of future earnings were impacted by rising interest rates increasing the cost of capital.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Real estate, consumer cyclical (or consumer discretionary), and materials also underperformed compared to the overall index.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The trends are reflective of the fact that <a href=\"https://advisor.visualcapitalist.com/rising-rates-value-stocks-outperformed/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">value stocks</a> like energy and healthcare historically outperform growth stocks during periods of rising rates, though there are many varying factors that can alter performance.</p>\n\n\n\n<h2>Major Shifts in Q4 </h2>\n\n\n\n<p>But as October has shown, the market is far from settled.</p>\n\n\n\n<center><blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24META&src=ctag&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">$META</a> plummets a whopping 25%. <a href=\"https://twitter.com/search?q=%24AMZN&src=ctag&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">$AMZN</a> getting crushed on earnings after hours.
