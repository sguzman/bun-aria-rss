  "title": "Bill Nye, on becoming the Science Guy and Saving the World",
  "description": "If you don't hear the words \"Bill Nye\" and automatically fill in, mentally, \"the Science Guy\" (ideally with the exact right tune and rhythm from his old theme song), then you probably weren't alive during the 1990s, when Nye's series (Bill Nye the Science Guy, naturally) became a hit with kids, parents, and teachers throughout the country. A former engineer and stand-up comedian, Nye's ability to blend introductions to scientific concepts with goofy humor made him a favorite.\n\nSince that show left the air in 1998, Nye has become an evangelist for the joys of understanding the way the world works. Yet even as he's worked to continue educating everybody about science, science has become more of a hot-button issue than ever before, leaving Nye in the middle of political debates over climate change. Hence his new Netflix series, Bill Nye Saves the World, now in its second season. \n\nIt's a talk show, sort of, but it's also a series filled with scientific demonstrations, reported segments, and comedy bits. It's like a variety show where everything revolves around science somehow.\n\nNye joined Todd to talk about his evolution from engineer to entertainer, how he's felt landing at the center of political debates, and what engineering has in common with making a TV show.\n      \n      \n      \nLearn more about your ad choices.
