  "description": "Contributor(s): Chris Gilson, Vassilis Monastriotis, Rainbow Murray, Professor Paul de Grauwe | We hear from specialists on the rise of the far right in Europe and examine the extent to which the growing popularity of right movements is linked to austerity. LSE Senior Lecturer in Political Economy of South Eastern Europe, Vassilis Monastriotis, traces the rise of the Golden Dawn Party in Greece. Reader in politics at Queen Mary University, Rainbow Murray, speaks to us about France's the Front National and why the apple may not fall too far from the Le Pen family tree. Professor Paul de Grauwe, Head of LSE's European Institute, speaks about his ideal Europe and why the financial crisis should lead to greater political unification. Presented by Chris Gilson. Produced by Cheryl Brumley. Other Contributors: Stuart Brown, Vassilis Monastriotis, Rainbow Murray, Paul de Grauwe. Music and sound came courtesy of the following users at freesound.org: bebeto (loop022); suonho (memorymoon-pad and abstract-electrofunkbreak); and the following users from the FreeMusicArchive.org: ghost and the song (Ou Inme); Super Flower (Camden Park).",
