And we will compare it with their equivalent in the tensor covariant formalism. Leading to a one-to-one map in the four equations.Also, we will obtain another four extra equations that do not appear in the classical formalism, and we will explain its meaning. In the same way, we will expand the Electromagnetic field strength elements and the velocity multivector of the particle.This will lead to new equations and new elements appearing that will be explained. The most important one, is the Electromagnetic trivector Bxyz.Lastly, an insight of the possible implications in the Dirac Equation of these acquirements will be commented.\n  \n   "
