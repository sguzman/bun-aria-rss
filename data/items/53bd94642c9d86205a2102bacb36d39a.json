  "description": "<p>Using machine learning methods in a quasi-experimental setting, I study the\nheterogeneous effects of introducing waste prices - unit prices on household\nunsorted waste disposal on - waste demands, municipal costs and pollution.\nUsing a unique panel of Italian municipalities with large variation in prices\nand observables, I show that waste demands are nonlinear. I find evidence of\nconstant elasticities at low prices, and increasing elasticities at high prices\ndriven by income effects and waste habits before policy. The policy reduces\nwaste management costs and pollution in all municipalities after three years of\nadoption, when prices cause significant waste avoidance.\n</p>",
