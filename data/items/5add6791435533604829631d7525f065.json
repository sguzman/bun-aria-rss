I received a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science from Ain Shams University. During college and before joining Google, I developed a passion for competitive programming that really made my years in college much more interesting. That passion I owe to the ACM (<a href=\"https://www.acm.org/\">Association for Computing Machinery</a>) community at my university, which was very challenging, yet fun, and pushed me forward.</span></span><br /><span style=\"font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\"><br /></span></span><span style=\"font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\">On the leisure side, I love 3D Puzzles, video games, boats, and electric micromobility vehicles.

It was very famous for being the coolest place to work and also the hardest to get into, which made it seem like the recruiting process would be very difficult.&nbsp;</span></span><br /><span style=\"font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\"><br /></span></span><span style=\"font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\">I had applied for every intern position during my first two years at college, and I was not at all confident I'd get a chance—I didn't at first. My first successful step towards Google was when I applied to attend <a href=\"https://goo.gle/2uD6ga1\">Inside Look</a> in Zürich, an event that gives university students an inside view at working as a Software Engineer at Google. My application was accepted, but unfortunately my visa was rejected a week before the event.&nbsp;</span></span><br /><span style=\"font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\"><br /></span></span><br /><table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PByejGhpYf8/Xh6PjeOqsvI/AAAAAAAAAzg/F8m8muHA0qcIShDCgmnNh2BMmTPp2o49gCEwYBhgL/s1600/IMG_20180222_164658_375.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1200\" data-original-width=\"1600\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-PByejGhpYf8/Xh6PjeOqsvI/AAAAAAAAAzg/F8m8muHA0qcIShDCgmnNh2BMmTPp2o49gCEwYBhgL/s640/IMG_20180222_164658_375.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-45c307fb-7fff-d165-85b1-382a8eef366d\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;arial&quot;; font-size: 11pt; font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Nada at the Googleplex in Mountain View, CA.</span></span></td></tr></tbody></table><span style=\"font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\"></span></span><br /><br /><span style=\"font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\"></span></span><br /><span style=\"font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\"><b>How did the recruitment process go for you?</b></span></span><br /><span style=\"font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\">As I was about to start my senior year of college, I was contacted by a Google recruiter following my previous visa rejection, to ask if I would be interested in applying for a full-time position this time — I definitely would!&nbsp;</span></span><br /><span style=\"font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 17px;\"></span><br /><span style=\"font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 17px;\"></span><span style=\"font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 17px;\">Due to travel issues, my recruiter worked with me to conduct the interviews online, for which I was very grateful, and yet worried it might not go as well as if it was onsite. However, my recruiter was amazingly reassuring. I decided to go ahead with my interviews online during final exams of my last semester. A week later I received the most incredible news—and two things got marked off my to-do list: (1) Travel and (2) Get a job at Google.</span><br /><span style=\"font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , sans-serif; font-size: 17px;\"></span><br /><table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4U5W8pmeyIA/Xh6OGjB-DzI/AAAAAAAAAzQ/65BbNGEml2Q07VOus6tUrTJUoAmqqbk9gCEwYBhgL/s1600/AirBrush_20181014141959.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1200\" data-original-width=\"1600\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-4U5W8pmeyIA/Xh6OGjB-DzI/AAAAAAAAAzQ/65BbNGEml2Q07VOus6tUrTJUoAmqqbk9gCEwYBhgL/s640/AirBrush_20181014141959.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\"><span id=\"docs-internal-guid-20cc799e-7fff-3f88-92a2-4adb12a67c85\"><span style=\"font-family: &quot;arial&quot;; font-size: 11pt; font-style: italic; vertical-align: baseline; white-space: pre-wrap;\">Nada relocated from Cairo to Google Paris!</span></span></td></tr></tbody></table><b style=\"font-family: roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 17px;\">What do you wish you’d known when you started the process?</b><br /><span style=\"font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\">I wish I had known that Google is not just looking for code-geniuses. Interviewers don’t expect you to go in and solve everything optimally in the first few minutes because that’s not how real problems are solved, but they do care about your thought process, how you approach a problem with a simple solution and move to a better, more optimal solution. This would have made me worry much less about getting everything right during the interviews and increased my confidence during the process.</span></span><br /><span style=\"font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\"><br /></span></span><br /><div class=\"separator\" style=\"clear: both; text-align: center;\"></div><b style=\"font-family: roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 17px;\">Can you tell us about the resources you used to prepare for your interview or role?</b><br /><span style=\"font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\">I mainly used online judges, like CodeForces and TopCoder, on a daily basis to keep a problem-solving mindset. I refreshed my knowledge of data structures and algorithms using various blogs and online resources about getting hired at Google. These helped me get an overview of what I should focus on and not get overwhelmed by all the things I didn’t know.&nbsp;</span></span><br /><span style=\"font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\"><br /></span></span><span style=\"font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\">Since I had to do my interviews online I mainly used Pramp to practice more effective communication. Also, I remember reading almost every question about working at Google and their recruitment process on Quora, which gave me a sufficiently comprehensive idea of every step along the way.</span></span><br /><span style=\"font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\"><br /></span></span><br /><table align=\"center\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\" class=\"tr-caption-container\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; text-align: center;\"><tbody><tr><td style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-j4dQXZtRNGc/Xh6PTST3hXI/AAAAAAAAAzc/T7Wt7UQvY1ABe2Y9Au72DgPrqZS8R3V6gCEwYBhgL/s1600/20180710_215413.jpg\" imageanchor=\"1\" style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\"><img border=\"0\" data-original-height=\"1200\" data-original-width=\"1600\" height=\"480\" src=\"https://1.bp.blogspot.com/-j4dQXZtRNGc/Xh6PTST3hXI/AAAAAAAAAzc/T7Wt7UQvY1ABe2Y9Au72DgPrqZS8R3V6gCEwYBhgL/s640/20180710_215413.jpg\" width=\"640\" /></a></td></tr><tr><td class=\"tr-caption\" style=\"text-align: center;\">Nada at the FIFA World Cup semi finals, which she attended after working on a project related to the World Cup.</td></tr></tbody></table><b style=\"font-family: roboto, sans-serif; font-size: 17px;\">Do you have any tips you’d like to share with aspiring Googlers?</b><br /><span style=\"font-family: &quot;roboto&quot; , sans-serif;\"><span style=\"font-size: 17px;\">Take your time honing your problem-solving skills. Keep an open mind, as Google is a fast-growing, changing, and flexible place, where you can definitely find something to work on that interests you.
