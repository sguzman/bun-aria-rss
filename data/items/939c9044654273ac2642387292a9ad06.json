  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, the framers intentionally decided on the phraseology treason, bribery, or other high crimes and misdemeanors. However, these words have significant meaning and with respect to bribery, it refers to a president, judge or senior official who could be bribed by a foreign government. No president has any responsibility to pay foreign governments and as a matter of statute, the President must, to his best of his ability, ensure that any foreign aid that the U.S chooses to send to another country is spent wisely and appropriately. Another lie is that President Trump is receiving a 'campaign contribution’ because he benefits from the Ukrainians investigating corruption (even though Trump is sending hundreds of millions of dollars and arms to them to fend off Russian aggression). Harry Hopkins, who had no official position in the U.S government, was asked to live in the Whitehouse by President F.D.R. and clashed with many people in the west wing because F.D.R. sent him on foreign policy visits including with then Prime Minister Winston Churchill in London. They also lie about Rudy Giuliani's relationship as Trump's lawyer and the role he's played. Using the House Democrats' logic, Giuliani should run for president so he can be immune from any investigations (like Biden has been). Later, Rep John Ratcliffe made a strong point when he asked Ambassador Taylor if he believed if President Zelensky lied when he said that there was no pressure or quid pro quo from Trump. Both Assistant Secretary George Kent and Taylor stuttered before ultimately responding that they believed Zelensky and that they had both only heard gossip from others since neither had contact with President Trump. Afterward, journalist John Soloman joins the show to respond to the New York Times' smear on his latest reporting.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
