  "description": "Today we’re going to be talking about exteriors and updating the outside of your home. This is a hot topic for Jess because she keeps driving into her neighborhood and seeing one house after the next turning completely white, which used to be Utah tuscan/brown. A lot of repainting happens with homes and we want to talk about the dos and don’ts of painting and what will or will not look good on your home’s exterior. <br /><br />An influx of house updates 5:56<br />Is black too trendy for windows? 8:22<br />Paint colors for shutters 10:00<br />Making minor updates without demo 12:38<br />Can you repaint natural stone on the exterior? 17:44<br />Brick and lime washing 23:45<br />Suggestions on trim and window colors for red brick reno, and painting brick 25:42<br />Would you rip off all the brick on a home and start over? 29:18<br /><br />“What we’re seeing is that a lot of people are updating and changing these houses. For the most part, people are entirely spraying their whole house white. The rock, the stucco, the brick, the beams they’re painting black and putting black garage doors on, or something like that. We’re seeing a lot of contrast.” 6:30<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
