  "description": "Beef cattle take a huge toll on the environment. In Brazil, a huge chunk of greenhouse gas emissions comes from ranching alone. And a California-sized chunk of the Amazon rainforest has been cut down to provide land for these cattle to graze on.\nBut one man, living on the edge of the Amazon rainforest, has a potential solution. In a series of small pilot projects run in his own small town, he’s demonstrated that he can work with ranchers to make their land healthier and more sustainable, so they don’t have to slash and burn more forest. He’s also shown that, by making the land greener and the cows healthier, he can dramatically reduce emissions from ranching.\n\nFurther listening and reading: \n\nChristina Selby’s story about Vando Telles’s company can be found at Scientific American.\n\nVox video has an in-depth explainer on deforestation in the Amazon and on the invasion of indigenous land in Brazil.\n\nVox video also has an explainer on why eating beef speeds up climate change.\n\nVox’s Umair Irfan traveled to Brazil last year to report on deforestation and climate change.\n\nWe always want to hear from you!
