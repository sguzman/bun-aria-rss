    "media:description": "Keneas was denied life-saving heart surgery when he was born because he was declared \"incompatible with life\". Doctors suggested his parents take him home to let him dehydrate and pass away. They refused to accept this outcome. Keneas was 3 years old when this surgery was finally approved out of state. He is now 6 years old and loves to play ball, but has many medical complications caused by the delay of his heart surgery. \n\nSupport SBSK at https://www.patreon.com/SBSK\n\nSBSK's Socials: \nhttp://www.instagram.com/specialbooksbyspecialkids\nhttps://twitter.com/chrisulmer\nhttps://www.facebook.com/specialbooksbyspecialkids",
