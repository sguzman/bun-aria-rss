  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, progressivism is Marxism designed for America just like China has decimated freedom in Taiwan. Using Americanized Marxism, the left uses freedom itself to destroy freedom as we know it. President Trump remarked that former VP Joe Biden plans to eliminate all charter-operated public schools, ending any competition or educational equality. Similarly, Biden is pushing for open borders, increased immigration, and free college and healthcare for illegal aliens. This is accomplished through propaganda delivered through assemblies at school, television shows, and other media. In this post-constitutional scenario, power is moved away from \"We The People' to the unelected portions of our government such as the courts and bureaucracies. Then, anti-semitism is running rampant in professional sports like never before. The Black Lives Matter organization is openly antisemitic and turns a blind eye to anti-Jewish crime. Later, Governor Ron DeSantis calls in to discuss how Florida is testing more than 90,000 residents per day. DeSantis added that the Florida Health Department found instances of negative tests not being reported at all which has skewed the overall infection rate. Afterward, Joel Pollack from Breitbart joins the show to discuss Joe Biden's many failures, the war on American culture, and his new book Red November: Will The Country Vote Red for Trump or Red for Socialism\nLearn more about your ad choices.
