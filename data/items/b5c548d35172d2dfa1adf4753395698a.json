    "media:description": "Over the past four months I have stopped learning Thai and started putting a lot of time an energy into Esperanto. Why? Because I want to, and I don’t care what anyone thinks. \n\nLanguage learning is not core to my identity anymore. I will likely learn other languages in the future, but if I never do, that’s fine by me as long as I’m being true to myself and keeping my eyes set on what’s important. Language learning may or may not be part of that.\n\nEgan dankon al Interkultura Novelo-Konkurso (INK) pro ilia subteno per patreon!
