  "description": "<p>Dante's Inferno! One of the most influential literary works ever written. Put to parchment in the early 14th century, Dante's opening third of the Divine Comedy presented a clear vision of Christian Hell, wherein nine descending circles, Dante, guided by the ancient Roman poet, Virgil, witnesses various types of sinners receiving poetically fitting forms of punishment. In today's Suck, we learn about the nature of epic poems, layout several examples of epic poems that came before Dante, and learn about who Dante the man was, before accompanying him, circle by circle, on his descent into the underworld where he will eventually meet Lucifer. We also summarize what Dante will encounter in the second and third portions of his Divine Comedy. Getting literary today, on a fire and brimstone, gnashing teeth edition, of Timesuck. <br /><br />Thanks for helping Bad Magic Productions give $12,200 this month to <strong>No Kid Hungry </strong><a href=\"https://www.nokidhungry.org/\"><strong>https://www.nokidhungry.org/</strong></a><strong> </strong>Click the link to learn more.</p>\n<p><strong>Watch the Suck on YouTube: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/0O42keSWx2Y\">https://youtu.be/0O42keSWx2Y</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://youtu.be/4Sxi48qqMbo\"></a></strong><strong>M</strong><strong>erch </strong> <strong>- <a href=\"https://badmagicmerch.com/\">https://badmagicmerch.com/</a>  <br /><br />Discord! </strong><strong><a href=\"https://discord.gg/tqzH89v\">https://discord.gg/tqzH89v</a><a href=\"https://discord.gg/tqzH89v\"> </a><br /></strong></p>\n<p>Want to join the Cult of the Curious private<strong> Facebook Group</strong>?
