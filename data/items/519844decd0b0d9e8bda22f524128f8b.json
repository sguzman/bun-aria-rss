  "description": "<p>The time has finally arrived to get excited for the 2022 Commonwealth Games and after a very unique opening ceremony we're back with a brand new episode to give our full review of it! Did we enjoy it or did it not live up to what we were hoping for? How excited were we for the flag bearers of Australia & Canada? Why do the Commonwealth Games love giant animals taking over stadiums? How awesome was the bull? Why are we so influential on opening ceremonies all of a sudden? Where was the Queen? How awesome was Duran Duran? Why did we have random interviews & celebrity appearances? And how did it compare to the Gold Coast opening ceremony as well as the past few Olympic opening ceremonies? It's all here and more in one episode you simply can't miss!</p>",
