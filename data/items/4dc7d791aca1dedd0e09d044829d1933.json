  "description": "<p>Today Louise is joined by two guest artists - Trayci Tompkins from South Africa, and Amanda Pickles from North Yorkshire in the UK. Together they discuss the challenging issue of confidence. A few years ago, both Trayci and Amanda took the courageous decision to shift their art in a new direction. Trayci had many years of experience as a best-selling ceramicist and Amanda was a full-time artist with a highly successful business making commissioned paintings, but both felt the pull of something new and took the brave decision to pursue their own artistic paths. In this inspiring conversation, we discuss how this change has impacted both their art and their lives - this is a conversation that will stay with you for some time.</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>Join Louise's free Find Your Joy course here<a href=\"\"> https://www.louisefletchercourses.com/wait-list-fyj-2022</a></p>\n<p>Find Trayci on Instagram <a href=\"\">https://www.instagram.com/traycitompkins/?hl=en</a></p>\n<p>Find Amanda on Instagram <a href=\"\">https://www.instagram.com/amandajpicklesallotmentstudio2/?hl=en</a></p>\n<p>Find our websites and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.alicesheridan.com&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicesheridanstudio/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p>Credits: \"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n<p><br></p>\n",
