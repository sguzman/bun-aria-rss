As you exhale, remember all you have done in the past that led you to come to be where you are today.</strong></p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Remember that you are allowed to forgive yourself and let it go. Give yourself permission to release any shame that you’re carrying. Forgive yourself.</strong></p></li>\n<li><p><strong>Think of the good things about yourself. Trust your worth and acknowledge that you are evolving. Remember, you are worthy of good things even when you think you are now.</strong></p></li>\n<li><p><strong>When you're ready, you can bring your attention back to the present moment. Take a few deep breaths in through the nose, and out through the nose. Drop your shoulder and unclench your jaw.</strong></p></li>\n<li><p><strong>If you'd like to take this practice a step further, you can write your own letter of self forgiveness, it can start with “Dear self, I forgive you for …”</strong></p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Today’s Happiness Break host:</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Alex Elle</em> is a certified breathwork coach, author and restorative writing teacher.
