  "description": "<p>Host Meg Wolitzer presents three works that explore the many-layered lives of women.  Edwidge Danticat’s essay “Women Like Us” honors the long line of strong women in her family, but also recognizes her need to distance herself in order to become a writer.  The reader is the late Lynne Thigpen. In an excerpt from Nora Ephron’s <i>Heartburn</i>, performed by Joan Allen, a philandering husband gets just what he deserves.  And an order of nuns has hidden strengths—and comic timing—in Claire Luchette’s “New Bees,” performed by Joanna Gleason. </p>\n",
