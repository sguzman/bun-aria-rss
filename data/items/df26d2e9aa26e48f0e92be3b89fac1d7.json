  "description": "One of Scotland's brightest political stars shares both the optimism and the realism that comes with being a Scottish Labour politician. Endlessly positive, often in the face of political setbacks, Anas shows why he's so respected across the political divide. As well as some hilarious stories about his mum, Anas talks about the shocking abuse he's faced - including some from Labour members. Anas answers some of the most difficult questions in modern politics: how does a progressive politician promote membership of the UK when it's led by Boris Johnson? How do you convince young people, who overwhelmingly favour independence, of the benefits of remaining in the UK? And what should Matt do about his impacted wisdom tooth?
