  "description": "Carlin was one of the most famous comics to emerge from the '60s counterculture. After it was broadcast on radio, his comic monologue <em>Seven Dirty Words You Can't Say on Television</em> became the focus of an obscenity case that made it all the way to the Supreme Court. Carlin is the subject of a new two-part HBO documentary by Judd Apatow and Michael Bonfiglio. Carlin spoke with Terry Gross in 1990 and 2004. Our TV critic, David Bianculli also reviews the documentary. <br/><br/>Jazz critic Kevin Whitehead reviews the reissue of Max Roach's classic 1960 album<em> We Insist! Freedom Now Suite</em>. Last month, it was named to the National Recording Registry.",
