  "itunes:summary": "You never get a second chance at a first impression,’ goes the saying. But social media profiles, online communities and virtual gaming provide, for some, an opportunity to seek a second chance in life.\n‘Second Life’ is a virtual world. Over fifty million people have created a Second Life character, through which they can live in this new world. They are looking for another chance in life.\n‘Second Life’ describes itself as a place ‘to connect… to change yourself, to change your mind, change your look… to be different’.\nThis virtual world is clear evidence of the longing of so many for a fresh start. Yet, in reality, God is the God of the second chance and third and many, many more. He gives us countless chances to turn back to him and enjoy his love again. God doesn’t just give us a ‘second life’ – he comes to us and transforms our real life.",
