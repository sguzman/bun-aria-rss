  "title": "Father Richard Rohr: Finding Your True Self",
  "description": "<p>Contemporary theologian and author Father Richard Rohr discusses how we can reconnect to our true self by overcoming the many ways in which our ego blocks our path. A Franciscan priest for more than 40 years and founder of the Center for Action and Contemplation in Albuquerque, New Mexico, Father Richard has firsthand understanding of how silence and meditation, deeper spiritual intuition and the inherent experience of love can lead to transformational discoveries within oneself. According to Father Richard, within each of us lies the true self and the false self. The true self, he says, is what religion often calls the soul—your eternal essence. The false self is the persona you create for yourself. Father Richard believes your goal in life is to find and manifest your true self.</p>\n",
