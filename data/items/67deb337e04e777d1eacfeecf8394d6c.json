In this video I break down a few major factors that contributed. \n1) Everyone has their own attitudes towards math, and Carol Dweck's notion of a Fixed Mindset affects our learning behaviours. For myself, I had this idea I was \"good at math\" which meant I wasn't doing effective learning behaviours to improve myself because I thought this was fixed. I also then quickly developed a lot of math anxiety where I worried my self-image as someone who was good at math would be proven untrue if I actually worked hard and then didn't succeed. Silly, but many of us have fixed mindsets that get in the way!\n2) I was really passive in my learning behaviours, doing things like copying down notes or reading notes, but not engaging in active learning behaviours I now think are more effective for your learning. \n3) I just didn't love it! Now I love Calculus, but it took my falling in love with math later on to come back and see a lot of the beauty. When I first took it it was just lots of computations evaluated by procedural fluency as opposed to conceptual reasoning. I first feel in love with math in an absract algebra course full of theorems and proofs. \n\n0:00 The state of Calculus\n1:08 Attitudes towards mathematics\n3:17 Passive learning behaviours\n4:18 Not in love with calculus\n4:49 My view on attitudes today\n7:15 Be an active learner!\n8:31 How I fell in love with math\n10:50 Learn math at brilliant.org/TreforBazett\n\nCheck out my MATH MERCH line in collaboration with Beautiful Equations \n►https://beautifulequations.net/pages/trefor\n\nCOURSE PLAYLISTS:\n►DISCRETE MATH: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHXZ9OQGMqxersk8fUxiUMSIx0DBqsKZS\n►LINEAR ALGEBRA: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHXZ9OQGMqxfUl0tcqPNTJsb7R6BqSLo6\n►CALCULUS I: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHXZ9OQGMqxfT9RMcReZ4WcoVILP4k6-m\n► CALCULUS II: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHXZ9OQGMqxc4ySKTIW19TLrT91Ik9M4n\n►MULTIVARIABLE CALCULUS (Calc III): https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHXZ9OQGMqxc_CvEy7xBKRQr6I214QJcd\n►VECTOR CALCULUS (Calc IV) https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHXZ9OQGMqxfW0GMqeUE1bLKaYor6kbHa\n►DIFFERENTIAL EQUATIONS: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHXZ9OQGMqxde-SlgmWlCmNHroIWtujBw\n►LAPLACE TRANSFORM: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHXZ9OQGMqxcJXnLr08cyNaup4RDsbAl1\n►GAME THEORY:  https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHXZ9OQGMqxdzD8KpTHz6_gsw9pPxRFlX\n\nOTHER PLAYLISTS:\n► Learning Math Series\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=LPH2lqis3D0&list=PLHXZ9OQGMqxfSkRtlL5KPq6JqMNTh_MBw\n►Cool Math Series:\nhttps://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLHXZ9OQGMqxelE_9RzwJ-cqfUtaFBpiho\n\nBECOME A MEMBER:\n►Join: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9rTsvTxJnx1DNrDA3Rqa6A/join\n\nMATH BOOKS I LOVE (affilliate link):\n► https://www.amazon.com/shop/treforbazett\n\nSOCIALS:\n►Twitter (math based): http://twitter.com/treforbazett\n►Instagram (photography based): http://instagram.com/treforphotography",
