  "description": "A new report from Kraken Intelligence uses the Bitcoin 200-week moving average as a crystal ball, to project the future price of the king crypto.\n\nSpecifically, Kraken looks at the multiples that BTC has traded at relative to its 200-week moving average in the past.\n\nIf Bitcoin once again climbs to a 10x to 15x multiple of its 200-week moving average, which Kraken analysts say is in the historical range, this would imply a future price range of $214,985 to $322,478.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
