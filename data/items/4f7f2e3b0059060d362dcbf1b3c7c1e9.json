Soon you’ll see some of those features roll out to your Chromebooks so you can try them yourself.</p><p data-block-key=\"cgogk\"></p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3 data-block-key=\"5rxdd\">Easily access your recent photos</h3><p data-block-key=\"f9fac\">When you’re trying to stay on task, there’s nothing more distracting than switching between your phone and your laptop to get something done. Last year, we introduced Phone Hub, a built-in control center that lets you respond to text messages, check your phone’s battery, turn on tethering and more, all from your Chromebook.</p><p data-block-key=\"5o4lv\">With the latest update, you’ll now also have instant access to the latest photos you took on your phone — even if you’re offline. After taking a picture on your phone, it will automatically appear within Phone Hub on your laptop under “recent photos.” Just click on the image to download it, then it’s ready to be added to a document or email.</p><p data-block-key=\"5lt5l\">No more sending yourself emails with pictures or going through multiple steps to get an image from your phone to your laptop. The next time you’re recapping yesterday’s hike in an email to your friends, you can easily add your best photos to the message, without ever having to pick up your phone.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"h-c-page\"><div class=\"article-image__is-caption h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3 h-c-grid__col--offset-2\"><a class=\"article-image--link\"><img alt=\"A zoomed in Chromebook Phone Hub exaggerates the new section called “Recent photos”.\" class=\"article-image--large\" data-loading='{\n                \"mobile\": \"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Mod_22x.max-500x500.png\",\n                \"desktop\": \"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Mod_22x.max-1000x1000.png\"\n              }' loading=\"lazy\" src=\" https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/Mod_22x.max-100x100.png \" tabindex=\"0\"/></a></div><figcaption class=\"article-image__caption article-image__is-caption-image h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"4c93x\">In Phone Hub, you can see recent pictures that were shot on your Android phone.</p></div></figcaption></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph_with_image\"><div class=\"article-module h-c-page\"><div class=\"h-c-grid uni-paragraph-wrap\"><div class=\"uni-paragraph h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\" data-component=\"uni-article-paragraph\"></div></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3 data-block-key=\"5rxdd\">Coming soon: connect headphones with a tap</h3><p data-block-key=\"bptub\">Bluetooth-enabled headphones help you stay connected without wires, but that can be difficult when you can’t figure out how to set them up. We’ve all been there – trying to decipher the deeper meaning of tiny blue pulsing LEDs. With Fast Pair coming later this summer, it’s easier than ever to sync headphones or other compatible accessories to your Chromebook.</p><p data-block-key=\"11mcl\">Just turn on your Chromebook’s Bluetooth, and it will automatically detect when a new pair of Bluetooth headphones are on, are nearby and are ready to be set up. A pop-up notification will appear and with one tap, your new accessory is connected and ready to go. No more digging through settings or struggling to figure out the right button to press to pair your headphones. Fast Pair also saves the connection to your Google Account, so both your Chromebook or a new Android phone will remember your headphones and seamlessly connect to them in the future.</p><p data-block-key=\"6n43l\">Whether you want to use new headphones to watch a video, join a virtual meeting or listen to music, Fast Pair will make it hassle-free. This feature will be compatible with hundreds of different headphone models — and counting.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"h-c-page\"><div class=\"article-image__is-caption h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3 h-c-grid__col--offset-2\"><a class=\"article-image--link\"><img alt=\"An image of a Chromebook showing a notification that headphones are ready to pair.

You can even draw or write on the screen as you record using a touchscreen or stylus to diagram or illustrate key concepts.</p><p data-block-key=\"52fku\">Screencast makes it easy for anyone to record instructional videos, software demos, presentations, and more. It will start rolling out this week, so give it a go by tapping the Everything Button and searching for the Screencast app.</p><p data-block-key=\"2rmr2\"></p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"78gt5\">Later this year, we’ll introduce even more helpful features that will make all of your devices work better together. In the meantime, we’ll be back to share more exciting Chromebook announcements this summer. Stay tuned.</p></div></div></body></html>",
