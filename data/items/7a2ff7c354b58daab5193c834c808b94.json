  "description": "<p>Barossa is one of the most historic, fascinating places in the new world. Winemaking started with German immigrants in 1840 and there have been ups and downs in the industry since. What hasn’t changed: there has always been a small cadre of winemakers here that have made outstanding fascinating Shiraz and Riesling. We dig into the history of the region, talk about its wines and give you another region in Australia to seek out.  </p> <p> </p> <p>We start with an overview of the Barossa:</p> <ul> <li>56 km/35 miles northeast of Adelaide, 34°S</li> <li>Winemaking began in 1842</li> <li>550 grape growing families, many with 6thgeneration still working the land</li> <li>Dominated by valley floors and rolling hills, with high altitudes (good for grapes)</li> <li>The Barossa Zone is made up of the Barossa Valley and Eden Valleys, warm and cool climate regions respectively</li> <li>Known for: Barossa Shiraz and Eden Valley Riesling</li> <li>Others: Cabernet Sauvignon, Mataro, Grenache, Semillon and Fortified wines, plus GSM blends, bigger whites (Chardonnay, Sémillon, Viognier), Tempranillo and Zinfandel <ul> <li>OLD VINES: Many Shiraz vines in the Barossa Valley are several decades old, some 100+ years old</li> <li>NO phylloxera (quarantine laws have helped) here ever so you can get old vines</li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Barossa ZONE</strong></p> <p>Zone = An area that usually comprises one or more regions.</p> <ul> <li>Extremely variable landscape -- elevation, inland locations and the coastal influence – lots of mesoclimates</li> <li>Valley floor is HOT – 95˚F/35˚C and dry, hillsides are cool with great diurnals</li> <li>VERY dry so they irrigate, except old vine vineyards on the slightly cooler western side of the valley –dry farmed</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Barossa Valley</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Land:</strong>Flat and hilly -- microclimates</li> <li><strong>Climate:</strong> Mediterranean climate: cool, wet winters and warm, dry summers, drought is an issue</li> <li><strong>General style:</strong> Very ripe grapes with high alcohol, low acid, short maceration to keep tannins soft extensive oak – usually American with coconut/dill notes</li> <li><strong>Shiraz</strong>:black fruit, dried fruit (prune) and mocha aromas, tobacco and an earthiness, black pepper aromas.
