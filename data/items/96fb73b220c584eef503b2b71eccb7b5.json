  "description": "<p><strong>Your worship leader is great. </strong>That doesn't mean he or she should lead your Creative Team. Music is obviously creative, but we need more creativity in our churches than just music—and we very rarely find worship leaders who are equipped or able to lead more than music.</p> <p>Hiring leaders who can focus on the creative aspects of your church allows your musicians to do what they do best while still getting stuff done. In this episode, Tony and Amy talk about who should be leading your creative team and how to structure your creative team to make the most of it.</p> <p>You can find resources from this episode and join the conversation by going to the show notes at theunstuckgroup.com/episode64.</p>",
