  "description": "<p>Having a civil conversation about politics in our polarized society seems to be a near-impossible task these days. But why? In this episode, Sharon and hosts of Pantsuit Politics Beth and Sarah talk about how we can have kind, thoughtful and compassionate political discussions on and offline. Beth and Sarah talk about the political polarization we face today and why people get so up-in-arms about politics. Their answer: We care so much because we care about each other.  When we realize this, we are able to diffuse arguments and have political discussions with friends and family members that are centered around connection and relationship. Sharon, Beth and Sarah teach us how to have fruitful political conversations with our friends and family - even if they hold opposite views. Political conversations can be enriching, relationship-building and thought-provoking. There is so much to learn in this episode - let’s dive in!</p> <p>For more information on this episode including all resources and links discussed go to <a href= \"https://www.sharonmcmahon.com/podcast\">https://www.sharonmcmahon.com/podcast</a></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
