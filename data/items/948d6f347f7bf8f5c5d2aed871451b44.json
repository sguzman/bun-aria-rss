  "description": "<p>This might be the first episode to get me death threats. The Turkish government does NOT like being accused of genocide, and neither do many of its citizens. But during WW1, genocide is exactly what the Young Turks orchestrated. Roughly 1.5 million Armenians were killed. And between 1900 - 1923, up to 4.3 million Armenian, Greek, Assyrian, and other smaller ethnic groups of Christian were massacred by the Ottoman Empire and their successors committed to the racist and xenophobic ideology of Pan-Turkism. Today's story is a crazy one. The craziest part about it is that it is not more well known. And it is not well known primarily because of Turkey's consistent and constant denial that it ever happened. It is literally illegal in Turkey to accuse the Turkish government of having committed genocide. They have cut off relations with other nations for accusing them of genocide. It's a topic that needs to be talked about more and I hope you are as fascinated by today's information as I am. <br /><br />Thanks for helping Bad Magic Productions give $12,200 this month to <strong>No Kid Hungry </strong><a href=\"https://www.nokidhungry.org/\"><strong>https://www.nokidhungry.org/</strong></a><strong> </strong>Click the link to learn more.</p>\n<p><strong>Watch the Suck on YouTube: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Cj6OtU58AQg\">https://youtu.be/Cj6OtU58AQg</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong><a href=\"https://youtu.be/4Sxi48qqMbo\"></a></strong><strong>M</strong><strong>erch </strong> <strong>- <a href=\"https://badmagicmerch.com/\">https://badmagicmerch.com/</a>  <br /><br />Discord! </strong><strong><a href=\"https://discord.gg/tqzH89v\">https://discord.gg/tqzH89v</a><a href=\"https://discord.gg/tqzH89v\"> </a><br /></strong></p>\n<p>Want to join the Cult of the Curious private<strong> Facebook Group</strong>?
