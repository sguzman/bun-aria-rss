  "description": "<p>An absolutely packed show with a guest you have been waiting for for over a year. We are joined off the top of the show by Markell Washington to talk about his life and join us for headlines. We discuss Durte Dom's viral tesla jump, MGK cover art stealing accusations, and OnlyFans outrage.\n\nWe recap Bri's tour where she was joined by Josh, Josh's huge wipeout, and the two BFFs getting awfully close dancing with each other on stage. We also discuss Josh's Tik Tok's with Mads Lewis after the BFFs interview from the day before wrapped\n\nSpeaking of, we are joined by Mads Lewis (finally) to talk about everything. We cover the Jaden and Nessa drama, her thoughts on the situation, her viral Call Her Daddy interview, her breakup with Christian, where she is at now, her future plans and goals, and play a game of \"Word Association\" that has every single person you would hope would be in there.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
