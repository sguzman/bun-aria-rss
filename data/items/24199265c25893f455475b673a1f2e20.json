The fat inside your belly is called “VAT” or visceral adipose tissue and this type of fat is particularly dangerous. When you begin to put on weight, especially this lethal belly fat, your biology shifts out of balance, veering into the unstable and unhealthy territory of disease—which in turn often leads to more weight gain.</p><br><p>In this episode, Dr. Hyman sits down with Dr. Elizabeth Boham to explain how belly fat contributes to other health issues. They also discuss the numerous factors that contribute to belly fat, including but not limited to diet, and how they work with patients to eliminate excess visceral fat.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Elizabeth Boham is a physician and nutritionist who practices Functional Medicine at The UltraWellness Center in Lenox, MA. Through her practice and lecturing, she has helped thousands of people achieve their goals of optimum health and wellness. She witnesses the power of nutrition every day in her practice and is committed to training other physicians to utilize nutrition in healing. Dr. Boham has contributed to many articles and wrote the latest chapter on Obesity for the <em>Rankel Textbook of Family Medicine</em>.
