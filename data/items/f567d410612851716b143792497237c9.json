  "title": "Group Therapy: Does She Tell Her Husband?",
  "description": "This wife tells us about how a bunch of the couples in their neighborhood get together a few times a year. They're not super tight, but a few of them go up to each other’s cabins a few times a year, have wine in the back yard, etc.\n\nThere’s one couple that is totally normal and everyone likes them but the husband always seems like he’s “testing the waters” with her. He always gives her too long of a hug, he puts his arm around her too much and stands a little too close.\n\nWhat does she do?",
