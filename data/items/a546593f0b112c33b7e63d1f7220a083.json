  "title": "Zero Carbon Future 4: Adaptation and the Future of Climate Modeling",
  "description": "While world leaders and businesses are making pledges to mitigate climate change by reducing their greenhouse gas emissions, many parts of the world are already struggling to adapt to a warming planet. The Far North - places like Siberia and Alaska, parts of which are warming three times faster than the global average - are ground zero. In this episode, we look at how they are dealing with thawing permafrost; the struggle to pay for adaptation in other U.S. cities; and why scientists say future climate models need to become more granular, to help communities prepare. Ann Simmons weighs in from Russia and Georgi Kantchev joins from Germany. Emily Schwing reports from Alaska. With science writer Robert Lee Hotz. Janet Babin hosts\nLearn more about your ad choices.
