  "description": "Elizabeth Stanley has a long history of stress and trauma. In this episode she talks about the adversities she has suffered, which include a near death experience and losing her eyesight for extended periods of time from contracting Lyme disease while serving in the military. After decades of \"powering through\" and not dealing with her difficult emotions, she reached a breaking point. That's when her healing journey began and she found meditation, sitting multiple long retreats. Stanley has since created a resilience training program, called Mindfulness-based Mind Fitness Training, that she has taught to military troops and to people working in high-stress situations. Her book, \"Widen the Window,\" offers tools on thriving during stress and recovering from trauma.\nPlugzone:\nWebsite: https://elizabeth-stanley.com/\n\"Widen the Window\": https://www.amazon.com/Widen-Window-Training-Thrive-Recover/dp/0735216592\nInsiders Feedback Group: https://10percenthappier.typeform.com/to/vHz4q4\nHave a question for Dan?
