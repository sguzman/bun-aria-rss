  "description": "<p>Today we’re talking about “Leader-Vision!” If that sounds like a superpower, well, it kind of is! You see, leaders have the ability to see the future––what could be and should be. You don’t need a crystal ball or a fortune teller to show you the future, because leaders are the people that form the future. Today on the podcast, John Maxwell is going to share his take on what the Gallup Management Journal calls “Visioning.” Visioning is the leader’s ability to look out, across, and beyond the organization to the future and usher in the people they lead. You’re going to learn what makes the foundation of a good vision, what fuels the vision, and what makes a vision a success.</p> <p>For the application portion of the episode, Mark Cole and Chris Goede discuss the ways they implement these principles to see and sculpt the future of The John Maxwell Enterprise. They share how leaders can see what is not there and how the future is shaped by what we imagine.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this episode is the Leader-Vision Worksheet, which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching. You can download the worksheet by visiting MaxwellPodcast.com/LeaderVision and clicking “Download the Bonus Resource.”</p> <p>References:</p> <p><a href= \"https://store.johnmaxwell.com/Developing-the-Leader-Within-You-20--Hardcover_p_2870.html\"> <em>Developing the Leader Within You 2.0</em> by John C.
