  "title": "76 - Tupac & Biggie: Fame, Money, & Murder",
  "description": "<p>Tupac and Biggie - two of the biggest hip hop stars of all time. And neither of them would see the age of 26. Their West Coast/East Coast rap feud helped sell millions of records, helped launch the career of Puff Daddy. It cemented Death Row Records as one of the greatest hip hop labels of all time. I listened to a ton of Tupac growing up. And who hasn’t heard some Biggie? But how much do we really know about either man? Well, after today’s episode, you’ll know a lot. Biggie, biggie, biggie, can’t you see that we’ve got to learn a little bit about you and Tupac’s history, today, on Timesuck.</p>\n<p>Support a fellow Timesucker who lost his home and belongings in a recent flood.
