  "description": "<p>Jelly Roll talks about his new song “Save Me” and his newest album that is in production.  Bunnie and Jelly answer questions from fans. </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Takeaways:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Jelly's new song “Save Me” was written in just a few hours on a Sunday afternoon. That Monday, they shot the video for it. </li> <li>The song hit 1 million views on Father’s Day on YouTube, in just four days. It also hit 2 million in less than a week on Facebook, and so far, has 100,000+ views on Twitter and Instagram.      </li> <li>On last week’s episode, Felicia, Jelly’s Baby mama, spoke out about her struggle with addiction. Jelly is so happy to see her sober and back in Bailee’s life.   </li> <li>Jelly is currently working on a new album. He has been writing constantly and now wants to let the album breathe and find a good balance.   </li> <li>Artists want to feel free to do what they want to do, and Jelly feels so blessed that his fan base allows him to have that creative freedom. </li> <li>Bunnie and Jelly answer more fan questions: <ul> <li>“What do you think a big turn off in the bedroom is?” <ul> <li>Smells- anything that doesn’t smell appealing</li> </ul> </li> <li>“Is Jelly still playing in NOLA on the 10th?” <ul> <li>Every show that has been booked and is still not cancelled is due to the fact that the state hasn’t cancelled it. Jelly and his team have never cancelled a show on this run.  A lot of the venues want to cancel but are waiting for the official word from the government. </li> <li>Jelly promises to put out more music this year than the last three years combined.</li> </ul> </li> <li>“What is your favorite scary movie?” <ul> <li>Jelly loves all the classic scary movies; The Halloween movies, Friday the 13th, etc.</li> <li>Bunnie likes the Devil’s Rejects</li> <li>Their favorite show is American Horror Story</li> </ul> </li> <li>“What’s up with Noah?” <ul> <li>Noah’s mother wants him to have a private life, and Jelly respects that. They love him very much.</li> </ul> </li> <li>“How do you spend the first hour of your morning to get ready for your day?” <ul> <li>Bunnie is a workaholic and she wants to get better at taking time for herself. Jelly sits at the kitchen table and will drink up to a half gallon of water to try to get his body ready for the day.  Bunnie is a slow riser in the morning, while Jelly likes to get up right away. </li> </ul> </li> <li>“How do you feel about women subscribing to your OnlyFans?” <ul> <li>Bunnie thinks it’s great! Sometimes the mass DM’s she sends out are geared more towards men, but she loves that women subscribe as well!</li> </ul> </li> <li>“What pick up line did you use to get Bunnie?” <ul> <li>Jelly didn’t use a pickup line at all. Bunnie and Jelly met at a show and they smoked a joint with some random girls and a friend of Bunnie’s.  Bunnie sensed that Jelly was sad and mad a lot, and she wanted to help fix him. </li> </ul> </li> <li>“Have you guys ever had to go to marriage counseling? Any tips on getting your partner to listen?” <ul> <li>Getting someone to listen is hard, if someone doesn’t truly comprehend what you’re trying to say, they’ll never get it- but that’s where counseling can help. Find a counselor together and don’t be afraid to see several before you settle on one. </li> </ul> </li> <li>“Jelly, will you get ordained and marry me and my future husband?” <ul> <li>Jelly is all about love- he’s totally down.</li> </ul> </li> <li>“How can I make myself enjoy anal a little more for my hubby? He loves it but it hurts me sometimes. Does Jelly like it?” <ul> <li>Jelly isn’t into it and Bunnie doesn’t find it enjoyable.</li> </ul> </li> <li>“My girlfriend wants to have a threesome and her bff wants to be in it, but her bff is like my little sister. What do I do?” <ul> <li>Jelly and Bunnie have brought a few of Bunnie’s friends into the bedroom. They enjoy it and it has always worked out better that way. </li> </ul> </li> <li>“Do you (Jelly) only get your dick sucked or do you fuck people?” <ul> <li>They’ve done both. They’ve even had a foursome before. </li> </ul> </li> <li>“When are you going to feature Bailee again?” <ul> <li>On Jelly’s next album</li> </ul> </li> <li>“When are you guys gonna make a porn on PornHub?” <ul> <li>PornHub doesn’t pay enough but check out Bunnie’s Only Fans for exclusive content!</li> </ul> </li> <li>“What’s your favorite physical feature of J and vice versa?” <ul> <li>Bunnie’s favorite feature on Jelly is his face. Jelly’s favorite feature on Bunnie is either her face or midriff. </li> </ul> </li> <li>“What are you and your family going to be for Halloween this year?” <ul> <li>They haven’t decided yet but they love Halloween- Jelly likes the gory costumes and specifically loves clowns.</li> </ul> </li> <li>“I want to know if Bunnie used that pocket pussy on Jelly yet” <ul> <li>They used it just the other night!</li> </ul> </li> <li>“How tall is Jelly Roll?” <ul> <li>About 6’ 1”</li> </ul> </li> </ul> </li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><strong>Quotes:</strong><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>“</strong>If I had a big dick I‘d walk around with just a sock on my cock and flip flops…” - Jelly Roll</p> <p>“What’s better than having two girls to smoke a joint with? Four! What’s better than four? Eight!” – Jelly Roll</p> <p>“I love that women support what we’re doing, and I think it’s amazing”- Bunnie</p> <p>“We fixed ourselves together” – Bunnie</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Mentioned:</strong></p> <p>Jelly Roll</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FxFNprPOdss\">Save Me</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/jellyroll615/?hl=en\">Instagram</a> | <a href= \"https://www.facebook.com/TheRealJellyRoll/\">Facebook</a> | <a href= \"https://twitter.com/JellyRoll615?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\"> Twitter</a> </p> <p><a href=\"https://crossesandcrossroads.com/home\">Website</a></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Check out Bunnie:</strong></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/xomgitsbunnie/?hl=en\">Instagram</a> | <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/bunniexo/\">Facebook</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/omgitsbunnie?lang=en\">Twitter</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://onlyfans.com/omgitsbunnie\">OnlyFans</a></p>",
