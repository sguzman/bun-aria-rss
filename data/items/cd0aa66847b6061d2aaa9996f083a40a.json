  "description": "<p>How do you choose between staying with your boyfriend or pursuing his best friend who is so hot you’re dreaming about him at night?  Is there a way to get those sexual sparks back if your partner’s body changes to the point where you no longer feel attracted to them? Who better to ask than relationship expert Esther Perel who joins Tig in person to talk sex, love and intimacy? The world-renowned therapist also discusses new emotional patterns she sees as Americans emerge from pandemic lockdowns and how we can use play, like her new game \"Where Should We Begin - A Game of Stories,\" to ease back into life.
