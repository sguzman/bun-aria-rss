  "description": "<p><p>Donald J. Trump, Jr., the son of the current U.S. President, joins the Kirk Minihane Show to talk about cancel culture, political correctness, AOC, and whether that dude from Deadspin is Dave Portnoy's butler yet. The crew addresses the mini-controversy at Barstool NYC that having Trump on the show created. Music's in the air as the talented Minifans perform parody songs about Blind Mike crying and S.E.'s sex life. Shirley Leung wants men to be less confident because feminism or something. KFC failed to praise Minihane properly yesterday so we call him up and bug him. Dave Cullinane is the host of a new Minifan show on Instagram. A new figure has entered the Minifan world, but we're not certain whether she's friend or foe.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
