Because every single one of us has developed a model of the world based on the source of love we craved most growing up. This is the what influences the way we think and the way we act. This is what impacts the way we filter information. And this is what forms the entire way in which we experience the world.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tony shows us that we all create certain rule structures to support our needs. And he shows us that by uncovering our top two needs, we can begin to gain more perspective on our lives.
