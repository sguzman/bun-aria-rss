BlazeTV’s Steve Deace gives his thoughts on why the polls – even Rasmussen – have Trump performing terribly. Filmmaker Dinesh D’Souza discusses the possibility of “cultural secession” if Biden wins. True the Vote’s Catherine Engelbrecht shows a great tool to see for yourself how the Left is changing voting rules.
