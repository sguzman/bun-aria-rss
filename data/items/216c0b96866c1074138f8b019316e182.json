  "description": "<div>Hi Friends!<br>\nHope you are having a wonderful day today. This story is strange and so so so sad !!! It still remains unsolved. I personally feel like , all signs point to the guys in the house. We may never know what truly happened inside that townhouse but Katherine and Roberts family deserves closure and justice for what happened to Robert. <br>\n Let me know what you think and if you have any theories. Hope you have a wonderful day today , please be safe out there and I will be seeing you guys very very soon <br>\nx o <br>\nBailey Sarian </div>\n",
