  "description": "On Monday’s Mark Levin show, There’s no doubt John McCain was a great patriot even though we strongly disagreed with many of his positions but there’s more talk about President Trump than McCain’s death and it’s all negative. Must the media politicize everything? Why can’t they give it a break for a few days? They use his death as an opportunity to trash Trump and the Republican party, but they don’t mention that he was smeared in 2008 by Barack Obama, the left and the media. Then, a leaked Republican document of issues they are concerned about if the Democrats take the house will most likely be used by the Democrats. Tax returns, Chinese Trade Marks, attacks on his family, payment to Stormy Daniels, transgender ban, travel ban, hurricane response in Puerto Rico and more. This includes requests to subpoena administration officials and in effect turn the White House into a 24/7 legal defense operation. This is designed to impede their ability to govern. If the Democrats take the House in November it will be our own fault for not voting, and they will pursue impeachment and try to burn down this presidency by gutting his achievements.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
