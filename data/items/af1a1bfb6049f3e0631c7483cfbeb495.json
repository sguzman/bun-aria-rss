  "title": "A Cat Litter Retreat in Mexico with Trixie and Katya",
  "description": "Fresh off an insane trip to Mexico for the kitty litter party of all kitty litter parties, Katya regales us with tales of hallucinations where she had an in-depth conversation about Franklin Delano Roosevelt's economics polices with a purple frog whilst on the deck of the Titanic. (in reality, she threw up a bunch after taking some psychedelics, but the purple frog/FDR story sounds amazing, right?) From a physical rebirth south of the border to Madonna's greatest acting performance to the joys of a shorn a**hole, today's episode is, quite simply, marvelous.
