  "description": "<p>Today’s episode of The POD kicks off with a full barn as the boys all jump right into their Halloween weekends. &nbsp;As usual a run DAHN from everyone on what shows and movies they’ve been watching recently. With a rather candid start the boys then jump right into the Pod FOD which is a folder compiled of all things around the internet. Today's FOD includes a look into a couple AI figures, a pitch for Dodge Ball 2, a close call with a great white SHARK and much much more. Make sure to subscribe to youtube.com/thepodpmi to watch full episodes and don't&nbsp;forget to send your submissions for the Pod FOD&nbsp;to&nbsp;@ThePodPMI on twitter and instagram. We appreciate&nbsp;you rocking with us and we'll see you Wednesday, Cheers.</p>\n",
