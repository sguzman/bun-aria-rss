  "description": "This week we are finishing our series on Building a Diverse Team. Last week, John talked about common barriers that get in the way of building a diverse team. This week, John teaches on the <em>benefits</em> of building a diverse team. There are so many leaders who would rather build a team of people who look, think, and act like themselves. But, building a diverse team will always take you further, make you better, and increase your reach. After John’s lesson, Mark Cole and Chris Goede explore John’s teaching together and offer some ways you can apply it to your own leadership. They also discuss the vital role diversity plays in creating powerful, positive impact in your organization and your community. <p>Our BONUS resource for this series is the “Building a Diverse Team Worksheet,” which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching. You can download the worksheet by visiting MaxwellPodcast.com/Diverse and clicking “Download the Bonus Resource.”</p> <p>References:</p> <p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/5rl8ZjB4Rk0\">Watch this episode on YouTube!</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://store.johnmaxwell.com/Leader-Shift--11-Essential-Changes-Every-Leader-Must-Embrace--Hardcover_p_2817.html\"> <em>Leadershift</em> by John C.
