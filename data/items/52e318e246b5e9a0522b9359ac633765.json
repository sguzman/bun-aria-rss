  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, historically the media has hated successful Republican Presidents. Abraham Lincoln inherited a nation in crisis with the American public blaming him for the country being on the brink of civil war. Some in the media criticized Lincoln's speeches including the Gettysburg address and went as far as calling him a gorilla. Yet, Lincoln won re-election despite being mocked. Many great presidents including the late great Ronald Reagan achieved success despite smears from critics in the media. Then, the Supreme Court has long been the topic of court-packing conversations amongst Democrats that have wanted to expand the number of justices on the Supreme Court since the days of FDR. The activists in the streets are just the same as the activists in Congress, the only difference is that some dress up as senators. Chuck Schumer is Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez in a suit because the Marxist wing of the Democrat Party has taken over. Progressives are adamant to dismantle the Constitution whether through repealing the filibuster, adding more justices to the court, or legislation that focuses on protecting the government rather than the people. Sadly, they are voting for the permanent dissolution of our Constitution. Later, Democrats are using the Constitution to destroy the Constitution. They don't serve the people, they serve the Party. If Democrats become the majority they will take control of America and give power to whomever, however, they want. Afterward, Rep Chip Roy calls in to discuss how Nancy Pelosi wants to hurt small businesses and healthcare. Finally, John James calls in to discuss his campaign for the US Senate.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
