  "description": "<p>How often do you stop to consider that's happening in your art? Do you pause between series? Are there certain times of year where you leave your studio completely? This week we're looking at the idea of creative flow and how a pause for reflection can help us move forward. Louise is currently exploring semi abstract portraits and intuitive abstracts, while Alice is sourcing new ideas from still life work. Neither of us are making any of this mean anything - we're not deciding where it will lead - we're just looking for sparks. We also discuss what to do when we have many and varied ideas - when are these distractions and when are they actually something we should follow? If you feel ready for a refresh, check out Alice's free online art retreat which starts on June 10th. <a href=\"\">https://www.soulrocketstudio.com/refresh</a></p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>Alice's Refresh art retreat <a href=\"\">https://www.soulrocketstudio.com/refresh</a></p>\n<p>Find our websites and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.alicesheridan.com&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicesheridanstudio/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p>Credits: \"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n<p><br></p>\n",
