  "description": "<p>Another golden day for Australia and Canada is here and we're back to cover all of that and more with our Tokyo 2020 day 4 recap! Why are we pumping our own tires today by declaring that THE CURSE IS IN THE PURSE? Was the 100m backstroke final the best event so far of the Olympics? Why is Kaylee McKeown the hero we never knew we needed? Is our commentary of the final our best yet? Is surfing now our new favourite sport? Why are we all angry that softball won't be returning at the next Olympics? How sad do we feel for Jess Fox? Why do we find weightlifting so funny? And why is today's athlete of the day the hardest one we've ever had to decide on? All of these questions will be answered and more on another epic edition of your favourite Olympic podcast!</p>",
