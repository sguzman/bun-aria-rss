  "description": "<p>Charlie welcomes congressman Matt Gaetz from Florida’s 1st, who has been under fire for more than 18 months for what amounts to nothing more than slanderous lies. Congressman Gaetz joins the show for a victory lap and to proclaim his vindication after a process more akin to a Soviet show trail than the type of justice system once expected in America. The congressman and Charlie then explore the unelected fourth branch of government. They brainstorm how to dispose of the administrative state without throwing the rest of the country under the bus. With lots of “Impeach Biden” energy throughout the base and happening all over the country, Charlie makes his forceful and concise case for the three, maybe four, Regime officials who should be impeached as a first priority come 2023.</p><p><a href=\"http://www.charliekirk.com/support\" rel=\"payment\">Support the show: http://www.charliekirk.com/support</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
