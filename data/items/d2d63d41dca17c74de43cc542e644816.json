  "title": "48: The Battle of Shiloh: “Now boys, pitch in!”",
  "description": "“Here boys, is as good a place as any on this battlefield to meet death!”\n\nThis is the story of the Civil War kicking into a higher gear as two massive armies converge at Pittsburg Landing, Tennessee. \n\nJealous Union generals are letting false rumors of Ulysses drinking on the job fly as they hope to benefit from his demise. But Ulys has some good people backing him up: Lincoln’s newest War Secretary Edwin Stanton and his good friend William Temcuseh “Cump” Sherman.\n\nBut intrigue is the least of Ulysses “Unconditional Surrender” Grant’s concerns. He and Cump are facing down a massive Confederate force led by two highly capable generals: Albert Sidney Johnston and GT Beauregard. Torrential rain turns the ground to mud as nearly 100,000 men battle for the field. Ulys ends up on crutches, another general dies, while still others meet their end in the legendary “hornets’ nest” or elsewhere on the field.\n\nThis lone battle will cause more American casualties than all American wars to date combined. Welcome to the Battle of Shiloh. \n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
