  "description": "<p>On today’s show, Pat and the boys are joined by Pittsburgh Steelers starting Quarterback, all-time FCS passing yards leader, and Junior World Duck Calling Junior Champion, Devlin “Duck” Hodges. They discuss his rise from practice squad player to 3rd string QB, to 2nd string QB, to eventual starter, and what that process has been like. He chats about the atmosphere in LA against the Chargers and all his thoughts pregame, his punting days in college at Samford, he answers some questions from around the room, and gives a little taste of his duck calling prowess (2:28-32:38). The guys also cover everything that happened over the weekend in the NFL including the blueprint on beating the Chiefs being out, the issues surrounding the Browns and who might be the cause for blame, the Cowboys falling apart and Jerry Jones deciding to back Jason Garrett. Pat also asks the guys who they would rather have in a backyard football game, Jameis Winston or Marcus Mariota, they discuss a rough flight back from New York, and Pat and Todd elaborate on their cars breaking down and possibly being done for. It’s a fun one, come and laugh with us. Cheers</p>\n",
