You, yourself, as much as anybody in the entire universe, deserve your love&nbsp;and affection.”</p><p>Sharon Salzberg</p><br><p><br></p><p>We all yearn for connection, yet often feel trapped by our sense of isolation, anger, or envy.&nbsp;But there is a&nbsp;key that can free us from this prison of despair.</p><p>Love.</p><p>The problem? Love is just hard to talk about. Harder to understand. And perhaps even harder to practice.</p><p>How we get it? How we give it? How do we attract it? How do we cultivate it?</p><p>To answer these questions, first we have to define it.</p><p>What is love, exactly?&nbsp;</p><p>Ask&nbsp;Sharon Salzberg&nbsp;and she'll tell you that it's not an emotion we should be trying to extract from another. In fact, don't even think about love as a feeling at all. Instead, consider it as an ability. An aptness or facility that resides within all of us that can be cultivated to create real, profound connections with others, with all, and most importantly ourselves. And it is that connection that will nourish the very sustenance of life itself and ultimately set you free.</p><p>Today I sit down with Sharon to redefine our limited interpretation of love. To dispel the misunderstandings that confine and circumscribe it. To plumb the eternal truths within it — love based on direct interactions rather than preconceptions. And to explore how we can better cultivate and expand our experience of real love in our daily lives.</p><p>For the uninitiated, Sharon Salzberg is a towering figure in the field of meditation. A world-renowned teacher and multiple New York Times' bestselling author, she has played a central, crucial role in&nbsp;bringing meditation and mindfulness practices to the West and into mainstream culture dating back to 1974 when she first began teaching.
