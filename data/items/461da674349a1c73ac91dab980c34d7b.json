  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, no officers were charged in the shooting of Breonna Taylor, who was killed after her boyfriend shot at police officers serving a warrant on him. Sadly, the media misinforms the masses, and those that prey on the misinformed stoke further division. Then, Democrat Judges are on the move to help Joe Biden in battleground states. In most cases, a single Judge in various states including Pennsylvania are redefining election day for political purposes. This is antithetical to the federal Constitution which grants each state's legislature such power. Later, it’s the opinion of this program that the Democrats will soon launch a public relations campaign to demand that any justice that President Trump appoints must recuse themselves from anything regarding the 2020 election. Similarly, former President Obama and other demagogical Democrats are warning that the election isn't about Joe Biden it’s about democracy itself. Afterward, Governor Ron DeSantis calls in to discuss how voter registration has increased in Florida and his anti-mob act, “combatting violence, disorder and looting and law enforcement protection act.” Finally, Chip Roy calls in to discuss the democrat party’s radical agenda and his run for Texas’ 21st congressional district.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
