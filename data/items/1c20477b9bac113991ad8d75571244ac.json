  "description": "<p>Robert Kelly joins me for the first in a series of podcasts where I'm just gonna do some wishful thinking. Fun podcast with a good friend. It's nothing serious. It's all about the stuff we've been thinking about doing. For now, it's because we can't really do anything. A year from now, it'll probably be about the things in life we've been procrastinating. But this is now. And Bobby goes over all the stuff he's been itching to do. These don't have to be the most important things. These are just some activities that have been bouncing around in his head.</p> <p>1) Walking Around The Mall</p> <p>2) Cigar Bars</p> <p>3) Staring at Girls</p> <p>4) Hanging Out At Comedy Clubs with Comics</p> <p>5) Hotel Room on a Saturday Night when the Week is Over</p> <p> </p> <p><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\"><em><strong>The Music</strong></em></span></p> <p>Sam Cooke - Another Saturday Night</p> <p>Biz Marquee - Albee Square Mall</p> <p>Beatles - With A Little Help From My Friends</p> <p>Mika - Big Girls (You Are Beautiful)</p> <p> </p>",
