  "description": "<div>Over 25 million smart meters have been installed in homes across Britain. Does this mean that smart meters have been a success? In 2019, <em>The Spectator</em> hosted Smart Energy GB on a podcast to discuss their rollout and now we are back again to reflect on what we have learnt over the years and where there are still challenges.</div>\n<br>\n<div>Have people’s understanding of smart meters changed? And are they really as efficient as they seem? Joining Kate Andrews to discuss where smart meters can fit into the net zero ambition is Fflur Lawton, head of public affairs at <em>Smart Energy GB;</em> Adam John, a reporter at <em>Utility Week; </em>and Jerome Mayhew, a Conservative MP who sits on the Environmental Audit Committee. </div>\n<br>\n<div>This podcast is sponsored by Smart Energy GB.</div>\n",
