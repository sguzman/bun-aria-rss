Antifa filled with rich, Ivy League graduates. Democrat Party politics comes home to roost. De Blasio was going to pull swimmers out of the water during virus lockdown. Drive-By Media distorts Trump, Barr use of word \"dominate\". Cuomo says De Blasio, NYPD didn't do their job, threatens to call in National Guard. Democrats have run their cities for years, we had 8 years of Obama as president, why haven't they made things better for African-Americans? Why do Republicans or \"white supremacy\" continue to be blamed. Citizens fleeing cities in droves due to coronavirus, riots. Only people left in blue states will be underclass and social justice warriors. Long-time caller Vinny, who fled New York, buys a gun in North Carolina.</p><p>PODCAST SUMMARY HOUR 2:</p><p>Trump speech, walk to St. John's Church was more reassuring to the American people than the media can comprehend.

Vinny, formerly of Queens, now living in NC, fears a civil war. More thoughts on Rush's Breakfast Club interview. Where are Obama and Oprah appealing for calm? Plugs makes speech, rips Trump, media praises. What if de Blasio and Cuomo are trying to force Trump to send troops into New York, so they can blame death on him?
