  "description": "<p>It’s been a crazy week. This past Monday, we launched our new iOS mobile app to immediate and rave reviews, posted our 100th episode and&nbsp;surpassed 3 million podcast downloads.</p><p>Pretty awesome, thanks entirely to you guys — the audience. Most appreciated. But how did all these momentous milestones mysteriously transpire on the exact&nbsp;same day?</p><p>I call this the principle of&nbsp;Universal Synchronicity.</p><p>In my book, I wrote something like, “when purpose aligns with faith, the Universe will conspire to support you” (actually I don't remember exactly what I said and right now I'm too lazy to look it up, but I digress). Toss service into the equation and that’s when stuff gets really crazy. My version of the age-old precept (and again I am paraphrasing),&nbsp;give of yourself freely and you will receive tenfold in return.</p><p>I don’t know why – it doesn’t make sense in the context of our logical three-dimensional world based in fact and physical laws like gravity. But that doesn't change the fact that these karmic principles seem to indeed be law. Spiritual tenets I suppose. Truths you can't touch, feel, see or hear. And yet without a doubt they are undeniable certitudes.</p><p>The aforementioned events in my life are a small thing in the context of life. They really don't mean that much. And easy to chalk up as mere “coincidence.” But through direct experience I know better. Cosmic signals. Roadsigns along the journey.&nbsp;I am being supported. And for that I am incredibly grateful.</p><p>When you begin to pay attention — I mean center your attention, turn off the chattering mind, get present and really tune in to your environment — you begin to realize that even the tiniest observations, events and exchanges can carry meaning. Not always. And not necessarily in any external sense, but with the implication that everything is evidence — forensic tools to help calibrate the compass of your life's trajectory.</p><p>To put things in perspective, I don’t have enough fingers and toes to count the number of times I have found myself in a metaphorical canoe without a paddle – unsure where I was being directed and just surrendering to the current, present and open to what might come downriver and proceeding only on intuition, instinct and faith.</p><p>Every time I allow myself to get out of the way, simply let go&nbsp;and allow,&nbsp;I end up someplace unexpected. This is not to be mistaken for giving up.&nbsp;In my experience it takes great courage to surrender the reins of control. And at the time it might not seem like it leads to such a great a place. I might (often?) temporally judge it as disastrous. But with the passage of time and the onset of objectivity, it's almost unilaterally something great. Typically a better situation I could never have anticipated. And inevitably a superior outcome than I would have handpicked for myself if given the opportunity to dictate the result.</p><p>By contrast, when I am clinging to ego, fueled by character defects, self will, self-interest or base impulse (which is more often that I care to admit, although I guess I am admitting it now), my instincts are unreliable. My intuition is adrift. The result? The Universe will inevitably deliver me the lesson I need, which generally involves enduring a proper right-sizing. Time for another compass recalibration.</p><p>In either case, it's always and without fail exactly where I am meant to be.&nbsp;I know this to be true because every time I peer into my rear view, it always adds up. Good or bad, the math is inevitably perfect. I wish I could access this perspective looking forward, but for whatever reason life just doesn't work that way. That kind of sucks. But it's also kind of great.</p><p>If I lost you, I get it. I still struggle mightily with these ideas.&nbsp;Too new age for me broseph – I'm out!</p><p>If you are still with me, I get that too.</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
