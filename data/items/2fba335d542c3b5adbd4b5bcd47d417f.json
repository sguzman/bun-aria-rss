  "description": "John Petrides, portfolio manager at Tocqueville Asset Management is back on the podcast to discuss current market volatility… and opportunity. To start, John gives his macro view of current market conditions… breaking down the volatility in growth stocks… interest rates… geopolitical risks… and more. [1:35] He explains why having an investing plan, along with managing expectations, is critical—especially in times like these… and why the current volatility has nothing to do with the market’s fundamentals. [7:54] With interest rates expected to move higher, investors should focus on companies with strong balance sheets… John shares one “boring” investment to protect your portfolio, no matter what the Fed does. [9:05] Thematic investing, which focuses on specific long-term trends, gained a lot of momentum last year—especially in tech and other growth areas. While many of these stocks are significantly off their highs, John reveals why this investing thesis isn’t dead… and some of his favorite “themes” to watch. [10:15] He also explains why he doesn’t think we’re headed for a recession... [17:00] Finally, as interest rates move higher, John points out why investors shouldn’t just focus on the higher number.
