    "media:description": "The 21st anniversary of 9/11 was this past Sunday and I went to the college campus in UT Austin to check in on how younger Americans felt about the subject. Americans are now paying more in taxes than they do for food and the price of groceries has surged to the highest level we’ve seen since 1979.

We’re talking economic collapse, the death of patriotism in America and the intense crime surge we’re witnessing as our leaders turn their back on the USA.&#13;\n_______________________________________________________&#13;\nOLDE COUNTRY SOAP: Checkout my favorite all-natural, locally sourced soaps from https://www.oldecountrysoap.com/.
