  "description": "<p><strong>This week Drunken Philosophy gets a little spooky (clanking chains!) because it's spring time and that means it's time to talk about death. Connor and Dan explore different philosophers' opinions on death and specifically whether or not we should be afraid of it. Also, because it came up completely organically, they spend an inordinate amount of time discussing Star Wars...sorry. Also, Connor's audio was a bit quiet this episode but hopefully it's leveled out some in the mix. Enjoy! Love you all!</strong></p>",
