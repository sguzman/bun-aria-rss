  "description": "<p>r/Idontworkherelady In today's episode, a crazy entitled Karen starts screaming at a kid about how he's a lazy employee, and she wants to see his manager. The kid is completely bewildered, because he's only 12 years old. He tries to explain that he doesn't work there, but the Karen refuses to believe him. Can this entitled Karen really not tell the difference between a grown adult and a 12-year-old child?
