Here’s a great review called “I Sheet You Not”: Honestly, I have searched a long time for sheets that not only have a certain feel, but are made in the USA. My search is over because of the fantastic product produced by American Blossom Linens. These sheets fit and hug the bed, which means my husband, a restless sleeper, can’t untuck these fitted sheets. There’s extra length and width to the top sheet, and even pillowcases are little longer. I loved these sheets that are crisp and heavy, but with substance not so much with weight, so much that I bought three more sets - one for each of our married kids! A big plus for me is the option of king or standard pillowcases with your order. Worth every penny!!! mThese sheets feel fabulous on your skin, keep you cool in the heat of the spring and summer, and will actually grow softer the more you wash them. These are craftsman sewn sheets are sustainably grown, dyed, and manufactured.
