  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, the Democrats reject the Constitution unless they can use it to destroy it. The left and the media are happy to use federalism to position themselves better to destroy institutions like the police and prisons. Meanwhile, children are being murdered in these lawless cities. Perhaps it’s time that 'We The People' defund the Democrats and the criminals. Then, the White radical liberal Governors that run these major cities and states like New York, Illinois, and California are run by White men that take advantage of the trust and votes of their constituents in these Democrat cities. Defund public colleges, schools and stop paying for our own demise. Citizens need to get on school boards and speak up because we're not going to get any help from millionaire athletes that hate America. Later, Black leaders like Malcolm X have been speaking out against the White liberal for decades and warned that the White liberal was the biggest threat to Blacks, not the White conservative. Afterward, there is a trove of 'tell-all' books to discredit President Trump and the First lady, all scheduled for release just before Election Day.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
