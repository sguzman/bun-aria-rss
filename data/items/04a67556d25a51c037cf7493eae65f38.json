  "description": "Angie Hobbs, David Sedley and James Warren join Melvyn Bragg to discuss Epicureanism, the system of philosophy based on the teachings of Epicurus and founded in Athens in the fourth century BC.  Epicurus outlined a comprehensive philosophical system based on the idea that everything in the Universe is constructed from  two phenomena: atoms and void.  At the centre of his philosophy is the idea that the goal of human life is pleasure, by which he meant not luxury but the avoidance of pain.  His followers were suspicious of marriage and politics but placed great emphasis on friendship.  Epicureanism became influential in the Roman world, particularly through Lucretius's great poem De Rerum Natura, which was rediscovered and widely admired in the Renaissance.\n\nWith:\n\nAngie Hobbs\nProfessor of the Public Understanding of Philosophy at the University of Sheffield\n\nDavid Sedley\nLaurence Professor of Ancient Philosophy at the University of Cambridge\n\nJames Warren\nReader in Ancient Philosophy at the University of Cambridge\n\nProducer:  Thomas Morris.",
