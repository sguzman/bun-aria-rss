    "media:description": "When Ayatollah Ruhollah Khomeini took control of Iran in the Islamic Revolution of 1979, no one could have predicted that would be a catalyst for the formation of the terrorist organization Hezbollah, or “Party of God.” \nSince its inception, Hezbollah has grown from a small militant group in Lebanon to a massively well-funded organization hell-bent on destroying Israel.  \nDespite retaliation from the Israel Defense Forces, Hezbollah’s power continues to grow and remains a serious threat to Israeli lives; a fact which will remain until true peace is found between Israel and Lebanon.   \n\nSubscribe and turn on your notifications so you don’t miss future uploads!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/UNPACKED?sub_confirmation=1 \n\nRecommended video— What is Hamas?\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=oqRNxTT6Nf0&list=PL-DNOnmKkUabmHqdEAhdCAd02JleQjPhA&index=37\n\nWe have merch! – http://shop.jewishunpacked.com/?utm_medium=youtube&utm_source=video-description&utm_campaign=merch\n\nLet’s connect:\nWebsite — https://www.jewishunpacked.com\nInstagram — https://www.instagram.com/jewishunpacked\nTwitter — https://twitter.com/jewishunpacked\nTikTok — https://www.tiktok.com/@jewishunpacked\nFacebook — https://www.facebook.com/jewishunpacked\n\n-----------\nImage and footage credits:\n\nIDF Spokesperson's Unit\nMichael Zarfati, IDF Spokesperson's Unit\nU.S. National Archives and Records Administration\nUnited States Marine Corps\nTasnim News Agency\nKhamenei.ir\nEdy Cohen\nIsrael Defense Forces\nAl Jazeera\nAl Manar\nAssociated Press\nBBC\nCBS\nChannel 4 News\ncime.inc\nDisney\nE.T.\nFrance 24\nGlobal News\nI24\nMichael Jackson, Thriller\nMissile Defense Advocacy Organization\nModern Warfare\nmtv\nSpielberg Jewish Film Archive\nTeleSUR\nThames - The Week\nThe Guardian\nThe Night After the Revolution by Reza Allamehzadeh\nThe Times and The Sunday times\nyes docu\n-----------\nAbout Explainers: From ancient Jewish traditions to the modern State of Israel, we explain it all.
