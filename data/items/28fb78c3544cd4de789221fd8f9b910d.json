  "description": "One of the continuing issues of the entertainment industry is the treatment of women in movies and television. Even with a larger number of female writers, producers, and directors, roles often follow stereotypical and negative conventions.\n\nIn her new book Smart Chicks on Screen: Representing Women’s Intellect in Film and Television (Rowman and Littlefield, 2014), Laura Mattoon D’Amore brought together 13 writers to discuss issues of the depiction of the intelligence of women on film and in television. The articles cover from the 1950s to present day and include interesting views of the depiction of females in both traditional roles and in newer settings.\n\nThe four writers interviewed with Laura are:\n\n\n\n* Stephen R. Duncan, who discusses the actress Judy Holliday and how her image was altered by the Cold War red scare.\n\n* Stefania Marghitu, who examines the character of Peggy Olson from Mad Men, comparing her actions in the 1960s from the perspective of twenty first-century writers.\n\n* De Anna J. Reese, who details how Kerry Washington is able to present a viable version of a black woman with power who is able to keep her racial and gender identity.\n\n* Amanda Stone, who discusses the importance of the female characters of the popular series, The Big Bang Theory.\n\n\n\nThese writers represent a great cross-section of ideas related to gender and intelligence that runs through the book.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
