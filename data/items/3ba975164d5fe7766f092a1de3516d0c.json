  "description": "In this episode we explain what we mean by \"Make Jesus Beautiful.\"  This involves mentioning Christian bakers, Christian photographers, Kim Davis, and how easy it is for us to make Jesus ugly when we make our way, the Christian way.  Mike also yells at Andy again, forgetting our small office space and sensitive microphones.  Mike and Andy also attempt a Justin Beiber duet.  Prepare for disappointment.\n\n- Mike Erre\n\nLearn more about the VOX Podcast:\nwww.voxpodcast.com\n\nSubscribe on iTunes - http://apple.co/1Lla1Nj\n\nFollow Mike on Twitter www.twitter.com/mikeerre\nLike Mike on Facebook www.facebook.com/officialmikeerre\n",
