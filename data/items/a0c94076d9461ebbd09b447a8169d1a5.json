A new weekly show that won't replace, but will be added to our long-form conversations and short riffs. Two \"guests-in-residence\" and I will be hanging out for the better part of a month, usually 3 or 4 weeks. This really lets you get to know them and benefit from their deep interests and lens on life.</p><p>In each Roundtable, we'll go deep into three specific topics. And, the thing is, nobody knows what the other person's topics will be until they hit the conversation.</p><p>My guests-in-residence for today's episode of&nbsp;<em>Good Life Project Roundtable™</em>&nbsp;(and the two weeks to come) are <a href=\"http://amzn.to/1RMZ9yQ\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Playing Big</em></a> author,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.taramohr.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Tara Mohr</a> and yoga-educator,&nbsp;<a href=\"http://msmoonyogiactor.blogspot.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Erin Moon</a>.</p><p>Our three topics in this episode:</p><ul><li>Great leaders - are they always doubting and what's the deal with self-doubt?</li><li>What's the deal with westerners reaching east for their spirituality?</li><li>Is mindfulness always a good thing or can it sometimes do harm as well?</li></ul><p><br></p><p>It's fast-paced, fun, utterly unscripted and at times a bit raw, but always good-natured and very real.
