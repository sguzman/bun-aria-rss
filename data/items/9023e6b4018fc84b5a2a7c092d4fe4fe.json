  "title": "ZBT #214: No-Nut November In The Barracks",
  "description": "<p><p>Round 1: Canada is introducing “veteran villages” in Calgary and the places sound dope. Repacking negatives and tackling them head-on takes effort. Props to some organizations for making that effort. </p><p>Round 2: Military families can be weird. If you don't believe us, listen to Podfathers. A family and some pals made a huge mistake by making some candy look like Crystal Meth on Kirtland AFB. Just a little meth goofin. </p><p>Round 3: China is a bunch of cheaters when it comes to the military games. Chaps has zero issues with it and it's not because he's an integrity violator. </p><p>Round 4: Malingerers worst nightmare is coming true. Science is developing technology to not only tell when you're sick but you'll know you're going to be sick 48 hours in advance. </p><p>Round 5: Just because one of the dogs was involved in the Al-Baghdadi raid doesnt mean you should buy one, you idiots. These dogs are like alligators with fur. DO.NOT.BUY.ONE.THEY.ARE.TERRIBLE.PETS</p><p>Round 6: It's no-nut november. We wanna talk about cumming at boot camp or during training. Did you do it or nah?</p><p>Round 7: There's an elephant that is terrorizing his community so much that he's being called Osama Bin Laden. For real. They are calling the elephant Laden because he's such a terrorist. It's not funny that 5 people died….but kinda???</p><p> </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
