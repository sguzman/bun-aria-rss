  "description": "On Friday’s Mark Levin show, the Trump legal team has announced a major fourth amendment motion challenging the FBI search warrant on former President Trump's private home Mar-a-Lago. Trump's lead attorney, James Trusty, joins the show to discuss the corrective action that Trump will be taking to attack the search warrant based on the fourth amendment and a lack of particularity. Trusty noted that the government failed to meet the required standard of what was allowed and was not playing fairly. Critics are up in arms because there has been an uptick in threats against the FBI, interestingly these same critics were silent when threats were made against Supreme Court Justices. Then, Democrats laud the passing of more tax-and-spend bills as if they are giving something to the people. They are not. Price controls are extraordinarily dangerous on prescription drugs or anything else. It's simple math, by capping the price of any drug the Democrats have made it harder to discover new breakthrough drugs and treatments because drug manufacturers will have less money coming in. This will kill innovation and progress toward helping people in need. These price controls will hurt the American people. Later, FL Governor Ron DeSantis will not allow the biased media to malign him or the Jewish people with their Jew-hating rhetoric or trying to tie him to the same. DeSantis has been an unabashed supporter of the Jewish community since he served in the US Congress and continues to do so as Governor. Yet the cable hosts and the ladies at \"The View\" call for violence.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
