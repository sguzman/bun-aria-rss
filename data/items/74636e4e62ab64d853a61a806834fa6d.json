  "description": "<p>Kevin Green. September 30, 1979. Tustin, CA. A heated argument between a husband and his wife prompts him to leave. He will drive away to cool off and get something to eat. Later, when he returns, he discovers that his wife has been bludgeoned and raped. The attack was so severe that she suffered memory loss and much of her ability to hear or smell. After medical care she will get to go home. But a short time later something will come back to her. The memory of her husband as her attacker... Kevin Green will be arrested and convicted for the crime. Many years later a DNA hit will alert authorities to a troubling fact. They convicted the wrong man. Green's former wife, though, isn't buying into his innocence. </p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
