  "description": "On today's show, Pat jumps directly off the tarmac from his trip to Orlando for a late night recording. The guys cover just about everything that is going on in the world right now including his trip to Florida for WWE business and his nightmare of a flight back home, the hot water that Facebook finds themselves in once again, the situation going on in Saudi Arabia and how the WWE could be the company to bridge the gap between them and the United States, some NFL chatter, Floyd Mayweather potentially boxing Khabib, and students in Texas needing to learn how to talk to the police before they can graduate high school. After the show, the kicker with arguably the biggest leg in the NFL today, fresh off his game winning 63 yard bomb two weeks ago, Graham Gano of the Carolina Panthers calls into the show. They chat about his journey from Florida St. to the USFL to the NFL, his kicking mentality, and what Ron Rivera is like (1:42:52). It's a wild one, come and laugh with us. Cheers.\n",
