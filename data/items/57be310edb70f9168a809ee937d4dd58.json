  "description": "<p>On Bruce Fink's <em>The Lacanian Subject</em> (1996) and Lacan's \"The Mirror Stage as Formative of the Function of the I as Revealed in Psychoanalytic Experience\" (1949). What is the self? Is that the same as the experiencing subject? Lacan says no: while the self (the ego) is an imaginative creation, cemented by language, the subject is something else, something split (at least initially) between consciousness and the unconscious. Lacan mixes this Freudian picture with semiotics--an emphasis on systems of linguistic symbols--using this to both create his picture of the psyche and explain how psychological disorders arise. <a href= \"http://partiallyexaminedlife.com/2013/04/03/ep74-lacan-citizen/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Get the full discussion at partiallyexaminedlife.com.</a></p>",
