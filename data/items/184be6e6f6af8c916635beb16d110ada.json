  "description": "As if a public health catastrophe and an economic disaster were not enough, America is now rocked by the worst civil unrest in 50 years. And, to make matters worse, the president is...making matters worse. Wherever he can he is pouring gasoline onto the flames. Having declared the riots the result of the work of far-left \"terrorists\" Trump is seeking to militarize the racial, political and regional conflicts he has been fomenting since the first day of his campaign. Where does this lead? How do each of these crises intersect with one another? We discuss with Juliette Kayyem of the Harvard Kennedy School, Jeremy Konyndyk of the Center for Global Development, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown Law Center and Ed Luce of the Financial Times. Worried about a long hot summer? This conversation will give you the chills.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
