  "description": "<p>Today’s show is anchored by a couple of great interviews. First, Super Bowl Champion, Pro Bowler, and current Head Football Coach at Lipscomb Academy, 14 year NFL QB, Trent Dilfer joins the show. Pat and Trent discuss the relationship between Cam Newton and Bill Belichick and how he thinks that will all play out, how Tom Brady will adapt to playing in Tampa and Bruce Arians offense, if Phillip Rivers still has enough in the tank to lead the Colts to a deep playoff run, why college and high school kids need to play football if they can do it safely, his thoughts on the whole Alex Smith situation and what makes him tick, and he looks ahead to Lipscomb’s first game of the season coming up soon (:38-30:57). Next, Head Football Coach of the Georgia Tech Yellow Jackets, Geoff Collins joins the program. Pat and Geoff chat about the current landscape of college football and how Georgia Tech is preparing for their season, whether he thinks the ACC will wind up playing football this year, how they’re trying to manage everything to avoid a situation that will cause them to go on hold, why Georgia Tech is so attractive to incoming recruits, and how often he is in contact with the people ultimately making the decision if they will play (32:02-47:50). Later, NBC NHL Insider Pierre McGuire joins the show live from the bubble in Edmonton. Pat and Pierre chat about what the whole experience has been like so far, and how exhausting the whole process of getting to the arena is, why Pierre has been really pleased with the level of play thus far and the ice conditions, and who he thinks is ultimately going to be able to win the Covid Cup (48:09-1:01:46). To close out the show, 2x Olympian, WWE Hall of Famer, winner of the 2002 Arnold Classic, The World’s Strongest Man, Sexual Chocolate, Mark Henry joins the program. Pat and Mark discuss Pat’s match this Saturday against Adam Cole at NXT Takeover, and what tips Mark has for Pat if he wants to be victorious. They also chat about Mark’s career arc and how it was difficult to coming into the WWE as an outsider, the most weight that he has ever lifted, what he’s doing now that really brings him joy, and why Pat and Mark bonded so quickly (1:02:48-1:32:54).
