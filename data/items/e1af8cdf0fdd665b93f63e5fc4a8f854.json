For less than US$10 you can often get a lovely bottle of red or white that drinks above its price point and is great for weeknight drinking. </p> <p> </p> <p>Here are the show notes:</p> <p><strong>We give an overview of the Lisboa Region</strong></p> <ul> <li><strong>Location:</strong> It’s the wine region around the capital of Portugal, Lisbon. It extends 150 km/93 miles up the coast, following the Serra de Montejunto, which go north from Lisbon, and divide Lisboa in half. Wines near the Atlantic side in the west are influenced by strong winds, mists, and weather. On the other side of the hills, the climate is warmer and the ripening more predictable (the wines are often better!)<br /> <br /></li> <li>One of Portugal’s most prolific regions (there are many co-ops here), until recently it was called Estremadura and was relatively unknown until it changed the name of the IPR to Lisboa, making it easier to recognize on the shelf<br /> <br /></li> <li>Wine has been made in the region since the Phoenicians and regions around Lisbon became famed in England over the centuries but have lost much of their cachet<br /> <br /></li> </ul> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/LisboaMap.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"255\" height=\"600\" /><em><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\">Map: Wines of Lisboa </span></em></p> <p><strong><em> </em></strong><strong>Terroir:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Lisboa is a large, hilly, varied region with two main soil types: clay-limestone and clay-sand</li> <li>Due to the mountains and Atlantic influence, there are hundreds of microclimates so wines come in many styles</li> <li>The climate is either marked by strong Atlantic influence on the coast with high winds and fall rains OR by a Mediterranean climate, when the vines are protected by the Montejunto</li> </ul> <p><strong><em> </em></strong></p> <p><strong>Grapes:</strong> More than 30 grape varieties are used, the majority for white wine production. Almost all are blends. The main grapes include:</p> <ul> <li><strong>Whites:</strong> Arinto, Fernão Pires, Malvasia, Seara-Nova, Vital with Chardonnay, Sauvignon Blanc and other international whites. They tend to favor the Arinto grape and can have richness but with balanced acidity to go well with seafood.</li> <li><strong>Reds:</strong> Alicante Bouschet, Aragonez, Castelão, Tinta Miúda (Graciano), Touriga Franca, Touriga Nacional, Trincadeira with Cabernet Sauvignon, Syrah, Merlot and other international reds. Reds are known to be quite fruity but with balanced acidity and tannin and no to low oak treatment</li> </ul> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/vinho-verde-fotografia-subregioes.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"412\" /><em><span style= \"font-size: 8pt;\">Arinto grape.

Arinto dominates and is likely native to here. The wines are like citrus and they have high acidity with salinity, minerality and sparkling Bucelas is also made successfully in the region. This wine was famed during the Age of Exploration, cited by Shakespeare in Henry VI, and a favorite of the royal family in England under King George III</p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Colares:</strong> Very close to Atlantic, northwest of Lisbon, there are only166 acres/67 ha left to this DOC. The area gained fame because it was one of the only places in Europe never touched by phylloxera -- its loose sandy soils allowed ungrafted Ramisco vines to thrive on coastal sand, even while everything else perished. The sandy soils have clay underneath to hold the grapes in the ground<strong>.</strong> The Malvasia Fina grape makes aromatic whites, and the famed red is the flavorful, tannic Ramisco with Castelão</p> <p> </p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><strong><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/LISBOA_10_racfQt2.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"400\" height=\"300\" /></strong><span style= \"font-size: 8pt;\"><em>Photo: Sands of Colares, (c) Wines of Portugal</em></span></p> <p><strong> </strong></p> <p><strong>Carcavelos:</strong> A small area of <strong>just 47 acres/19 ha</strong><strong>,</strong> Carcavelos is west of Lisbon and the area is pretty much gone because of urban sprawl, although some producers are reviving the fortified sweet wine of Galego Dourado, Ratinho, Castelão and Arinto.

Cold, wet winds, and high humidity seep in through breaks in the mountains, making viticulture a challenge. The moisture promotes vigor, so it is very hard to make quality dry wine here, although some producers are trying to make red.  </p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Arruda:</strong> Behind hills, protected from storms, Arruda makes red and whites (mainly blends) from indigenous and international grapes.
