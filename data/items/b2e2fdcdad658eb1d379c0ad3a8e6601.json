  "description": "When most people think of the Irish Republican Army, they naturally think of terrorism. But what of the political context that led to some 10,000 Irish nationalists to take up arms against a divided Ireland? With One Man's Terrorist: A Political History of the IRA (Verso, 2021), Daniel Finn tries to answer this question. This thoroughly researched study of the IRA explains the ideological and tactical decision making processes that led to The Troubles and the deaths of some 3,500 between 1968 and 1998, as well as the many disputes within the movement itself.\nDaniel Finn is a journalist. Formerly at the New Left Review, he is currently the features editor at Jacobin. He also hosts the Jacobin podcast Long Reads, one of my favorite podcasts (and not just because he let me do a 2-part episode on Indonesian politics). He’s done great work on Vichy, the Algerian War, Albert Camus, and a range of other historical topics.\n Michael G. Vann is a professor of world history at California State University, Sacramento. A specialist in imperialism and the Cold War in Southeast Asia, he is the author of The Great Hanoi Rat Hunt: Empires, Disease, and Modernity in French Colonial Vietnam (Oxford University Press, 2018). When he’s not reading or talking about new books with smart people, Mike can be found surfing in Santa Cruz, California.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
