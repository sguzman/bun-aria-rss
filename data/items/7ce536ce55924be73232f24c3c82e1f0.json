He is also my former student and the first participant of the SBSK Mentorship program. As part of this program I am teaching him how to create content. I promised Kev that if he reached 10,000 subscribers he could control my life for 24 hours. Kevin quickly passed this milestone and made it his goal to make me as \"uncomfortable as possible\" for a full day. This is what followed.\n\nSupport SBSK at https://www.patreon.com/SBSK\n\nSBSK's Socials: \nhttp://www.instagram.com/specialbooksbyspecialkids\nhttps://twitter.com/chrisulmer\nhttps://www.facebook.com/specialbooksbyspecialkids",
