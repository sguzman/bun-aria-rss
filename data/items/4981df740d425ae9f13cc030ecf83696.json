What have been the results of the creation of the Department of Homeland Security, the Office of the Director of National Intelligence, and a reorganized FBI? Have they helped to reduce blind spots and redundancies in resources and responsibilities ... and to prevent misuses of intelligence and law enforcement? How did a disaster like the Snowden scandal happen? In Spying: Assessing US Domestic Intelligence Since 9/11 (Lynne Rienner, 2019), Darren Tromblay answers these questions in his thorough, often provocative, assessment of post–9/11 US domestic intelligence activities in the pursuit of national security.\nBeth Windisch is a national security practitioner.
