  "description": "You know how we did a live show in Austin centered around animal mishaps? Well, there were several stories you submitted that we did not feel comfortable reading into a microphone in front of actual people. So we saved them for this episode, where we could read them into a microphone to digital people, who are not real. Topics include:\n- Ocean's 11 But Dogs\n- Prissy, the Radical Feminist Cow\n- Woodchucks + Fireworks = John Wuck\n- Tom Hanks as a unit of measurement\n- Unregistered Iowa Petting Zoo(s)\nLearn more about your ad choices.
