  "description": "<p>Listen, Mommies. It will be tough to top last weeks monumental achievement in podcasting, but we are going to \"Try It Out.\" This week we meet a man who Duncan Trussell exposed Dr. Drew to recently. He's definitely a Cool Guy. Tom celebrated his 40th birthday, what did Christina get him?? A chain or a private jet?? Doug Mellard got ALL of us the gift of a weird Happy Birthday serenade. Christina had a shower revelation that even bewilders the Cockroach himself. Since we had Robert Paul Champagne on the Podcast he has been live streaming quite a bit. We review some of his recent posts and then give him another call. That's right, Robert Paul Champagne is BACK!</p> <p> Also, the legendary Dane Cook is on the couch ready to \"Try It Out.\" Dane and the Mommies reminisce about old times at Dublin's in Hollywood and Dane goes through the roller coaster that he experienced while reaching heights of fame few ever get to know. He goes in depth about his brother stealing from him and his reasoning for improvising his special that was taped in Madison Square Garden \"Rough Around The Edges.\" Also, Dane experiences a member of \"The Cool Girl Club\" and \"Horrible or Hilarious.\"</p> <p>Next in the Mommydome is comedian Ryan Stout. Ryan can't smell anything, he literally has no sense of smell. The Mommies ask Ryan all the important questions involved with not being able to smell a fart or otherwise. Ryan brings up the \"Maplethorpe Exhibit\" and if you know what that is, you know what that is...  Plus Mommy Tina thinks airpods looks like something coming out of your ears. Do you know what she thinks it looks like???</p> <p>Don't forget to get Ryan's new album, <em>Man in the Suit.</em></p> <p>NOTE: Every guest of YOUR MOM'S HOUSE Podcast is INVITATION ONLY. No guest is welcome with out a formal invitation from The Mommies. Dane Cook, Ryan Stout and Robert Paul Champagne have all been certified, invited guests. Thank you.</p>\n",
