  "title": "188 - The US Civil War",
  "description": "<p>The US Civil War. Fought over 150 years ago and still the bloodiest war the US has ever been involved in when it comes to the loss of American life. Well over 600,000 Americans died. A greater loss of American life than those who died in WW1 and WW2 combined. A terrible war where tens of thousands of those who did live suffered gruesome field-hospital amputations. The fighting was beyond intense - tens of thousands of troops marching should-to-shoulder across a field in the face of rifle and cannon fire. Today, we explore not just how the war was fought but why. What events led up the Civil War? Slavery divided the North and the South - how did that divide begin? We cover a lot of information in under three hours in this week's giant, sprawling, historical suck. </p>\n<p><strong>Listen to my new standup special \"Get Outta Here, Devil\" on Pandora</strong> right now for free: <strong><a href=\"https://pandora.app.link/Az9xIdU6s5\">https://pandora.app.link/Az9xIdU6s5</a></strong><br /><strong></strong></p>\n<p><strong>Watch my Amazon special Don't Wake the Bear</strong>: <strong><a href=\"https://amazon.com\">https://amazon.com</a></strong></p>\n<p><strong>We've donated $5,000</strong> this month to the <strong>Meals on Wheels</strong> COVID-19 response fund.
