  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, Oprah Winfrey and Lebron James are frauds because they support movements that destroy our country while they reap the rewards of the free-market system that they have profited from. Yet the left's mantra is \"tax the rich.\" Tonight President Biden will give a Castro-like speech at his first joint session of Congress. Pontificating about racism and climate change and proposing that the federal government steal money, by way of confiscatory taxes, from a workforce that earned it to redistribute it to a workforce that hasn't. All in the name of ideas that Biden feels are noble. It's so much easier to propose these things than it is to correct and remove them once implemented. Marxism has always failed and always will fail. Then, Biden is a liar and is trying to make it look like he saved America from the coronavirus and that infrastructure means whatever he says. Rep. James Clyburn supports the left's reimagining of whatever they feel like as if the people working in government are the only ones that have a say, and not the people paying for all of this spending. Later, it has been leaked that in Biden’s speech he will say that the January 6th, 2021 riot at the US Capitol was the biggest attack on US democracy since the Civil War. The media will paint whatever picture they want to get their desired propaganda result. Afterward, the FBI raided the home of former Trump attorney Rudy Giuliani. Despite him and his lawyers agreeing to make themselves available to the FBI. However, the feds wanted to disregard any attorney-client privilege that Giuliani might have concerning the 45th President of the United States. Notice the disparate treatment between former Mayor Giuliani and Hunter Biden who has never been raided despite troves of allegations. \n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
