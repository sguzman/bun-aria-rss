  "description": "On this episode we do something a bit different, we are bringing you a long with us as we conquer one of our biggest fears: Skydiving. Colin is afraid of heights and Samir is a very anxious flyer - so we figured we should combine the two and jump out of a plane.\nWe started recording before we jumped and picked back up after the jump and by the end we are joined by our friend Josh Rottman. Josh is the one who actually took us skydiving, he's an incredibly talented cinematographer and is now filming while he jumps out of planes. You can check out his work on his instagram - @Emptyduckdigital\nThis was a really fun episode for us to record, we hope you enjoy it and share it with your friends.\nIf you have feedback for us, please rate and review our podcast wherever you are listening!",
