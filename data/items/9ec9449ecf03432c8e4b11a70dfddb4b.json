  "description": "Scholars and pundits have been busy trying to assess the legacy of President Barack Obama. Few have done so with the nuance and comparative approach of Andra Gillespie. In her new book Race and the Obama Administration: Substance, Symbols, and Hope (Manchester University Press, 2019), she examines the promotion of the substantive and symbolic initiatives for blacks. She compares Obama to Presidents Bush and Clinton to assess whether the election of a black president actually changed the status of blacks in the United States.\nGillespie is Associate Professor in the Department of Political Science at Emory University and previous published The New Black Politician: Cory Booker, Newark, and Post-Racial America (NYU Press, 2012).\nLearn more about your ad choices.
