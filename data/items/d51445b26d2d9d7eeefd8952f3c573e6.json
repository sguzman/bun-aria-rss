  "description": "In this message, Victoria will inspire you. God wants us to show up strong with encouragement for other people. The Scripture says, “But encourage one another daily, as long as it is called ‘Today,’ so that none of you may be hardened by sin’s deceitfulness” (Hebrews 3:13). To encourage means “to impart courage, to make fearless, to make brave.” God is saying that if we stand together like the defensive line on a football team, we will stand victoriously against the enemy’s deceit and discouragement. Encourage your family, encourage your children, encourage your coworkers, encourage your boss, encourage your pastor. Ask God to give you someone today to encourage in a meaningful and profound way. Let’s push back the darkness with encouragement every day!<p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
