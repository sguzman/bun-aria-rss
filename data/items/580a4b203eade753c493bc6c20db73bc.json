  "description": "<p>Much of what you see in the “divine feminine” space online is not actually the divine feminine… The divine feminine is not about being a submissive, male fantasy version of you that swallows her truth and instead uses her sexuality to receive attention, validation and love.</p> <p>In this solo episode for the first time ever, I share an experience as a young woman in a “tantra” workshop in India and how horrific it was. I address the hidden patriarchy that is often present in the polarity space, how women are often used for our innate desire to be loved and why we need to speak about it as a spiritual community. While there is great beauty in true Tantra.. A lot of the practices we see today in the “neo tantra” space are not actually Tantra but used as a form of manipulation.</p> <p>This is a deep, vulnerable, and raw episode about a topic that is often silenced but now, enough is enough. Remember- the feminine is also embodied through rage, power, truth, sovereignty, strength, and everything else in between.</p> <p>If you’re feeling the call to embody more ease, flow, creativity and joy from a cellular level - my Free Embodiment Practice is meant for you: <a href=\"https://iamsahararose.com/embodiment\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\"><u>https://iamsahararose.com/embodiment</u></a></p> <p>To receive a free gift, email a screenshot of your review of the Highest Self Podcast to <a href= \"mailto:sahara@iamsahararose.com\"><u>sahara@iamsahararose.com</u></a></p> <p>Intro + Outro Music: Silent Ganges by Maneesh de Moor</p> <p>Follow me your spiritual bestie to active your fullest expression + laugh along the way:</p> <p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/iamsahararose\" target= \"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\"><u>https://www.Instagram.com/iamsahararose</u></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/@iamsahararose\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><u>https://www.tiktok.com/@iamsahararose</u></a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/iamsahararose\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\"><u>https://www.Facebook.com/iamsahararose</u></a></p> <p>Discover Your Dharma Archetype with my free quiz <a href= \"http://www.dharmaarchetypequiz.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\"><u>http://www.dharmaarchetypequiz.com</u></a></p> <p>Download my Goddess Embodiment Practice:</p> <p><a href=\"http://www.iamsahararose.com/embodiment\" target= \"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\"><u>http://www.iamsahararose.com/embodiment</u></a></p> <p>Order My Books: <a href= \"https://www.iamsahararose.com/books\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\"><u>https://www.iamsahararose.com/books</u></a></p> <p>By accessing this Podcast, I acknowledge that the entire contents are the property of Sahara Rose, or used by Sahara Rose with permission, and are protected under U.S. and international copyright and trademark laws.
