  "description": "<p>Eddie is a fantastic stand-up comedians and has been one of my favorites for many years. His ability to go off on a tangent and then bring everything back around is truly unique. Check out his comedy specials if you're interested or go see him live. He had a great conversation with Joe and was a pleasure to review.</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Enjoy my review folks!</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Please email me with any suggestions and questions for future shows :</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com</p>\n",
