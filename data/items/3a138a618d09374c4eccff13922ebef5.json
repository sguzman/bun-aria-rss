  "description": "This year marks the 60th anniversary of the signing of the Treaty of Rome, which started the process of European integration. This presents an opportunity to reflect on the progress that has been made so far, and to discuss what Europeans can expect in the future. We explore some of the central questions on this topic with our guests.\n\nEurope is facing a period of doubt and uncertainty, but this is not the first time it has faced a crisis. We begin this episode by asking Emmanuel Mourlon-Druol how today's challenges compare to previous periods where Europe has faced difficulties. Ivan Krastev goes on to discuss how much control Europe has over its decision-making, and to what extent it responds to external circumstances.\n\nAs uncertainty especially affects the younger generation of Europeans, Johanna Nyman examines how young people perceive the future of Europe and what they have to look forward to. Guntram Wolff shares his view on what Europeans should be hopeful about, and what they should worry about.\n\nOur guests go on to debate what Europe can offer its citizens and what questions it will have to answer to move forward. Finally they reflect on the impact of the Treaty of Rome over the last 60 years.\n\nSPEAKERS\n\nEmmanuel Mourlon-Druol, Non-resident fellow, Bruegel\n\nIvan Krastev, Chairman of the Centre for Liberal Strategies ,Sofia and Permanent fellow at the Institute for Human Sciences, Vienna\n\nJohanna Nyman, Expert on youth policy and human rights\n\nGuntram B. Wolff, Director, Bruegel\n\nCREDITS\n\nProduced by Giuseppe Porcaro\nPresented by Bryn Watkins",
