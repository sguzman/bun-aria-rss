  "description": "<p>You can’t grow if you don’t confront that which limits you. So face it. Ask for help. Have the hard conversations. Commit to the work. And I promise, your life will change.</p><p>I’ve seen it come to pass countless times—in myself and many others.</p><p>But few have more experience with personal transformation than&nbsp;<strong>Karamo Brown</strong>—a man who overcame tremendous adversity to enliven the best in others.</p><p>The ‘culture’ expert on Netflix’s massive hit show Queer Eye, Karamo is a father, former social worker, and psychotherapist who was first introduced to audiences on MTV’s The Real World in 2004. He continued to build their trust as a host on Dr. Drew Live, HuffPost Live, and Access Hollywood Live.</p><p>Karamo’s self-titled primer on emotional healing, Karamo: My Story Of Embracing Purpose, Healing, is an inspiring must-read for anyone grappling with adversity. In addition, he is the founder of 6in10, an organization that provides mental health support and education to the LGBTQ+ community, and the co-founder of Mantl, a skin-care line for bald men.</p><p>Today he shares his powerful story, dropping pearls of guidance in the process.</p><p>This is a conversation about culture beyond art museums and the ballet. It’s about how people feel about themselves and others, how they relate to the world around them, and how their shared labels, burdens, and experiences affect their daily lives in ways both subtle and profound.</p><p>It’s also about the culture of Karamo. Raised in the South by a Jamaican father and Cuban mother in predominantly white neighborhoods, it’s a story of overcoming personal issues of colorism, physical and emotional abuse. Alcohol and drug addiction. And public infamy.</p><p>But more than anything,&nbsp;this is a conversation about what holds people back. It’s about the importance of exploring our difficulties. And what’s required to transcend our past, move forward, and ultimately live our best lives.</p><br><p>FULL BLOG & SHOW NOTES:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gate.sc/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2Frichroll573&token=21fd57-1-1660430434164\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/richroll573</a></p><br><p>YouTube:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://gate.sc/?url=http%3A%2F%2Fbit.ly%2Fkaramobrown573&token=e73ebc-1-1660430434164\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/karamobrown573</a></p><br><p>I adore this man and I love this conversation.</p><p>Peace + Plants,</p><p><img src=\"http://www.richroll.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/RR-SIGNATURE-FOR-WEB-1101.png\"></p><p><br></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
