  "description": "<p>Last week we went deep <a href=\"https://www.richroll.com/podcast/radhanath-swami-543/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">with an actual monk.</a> Today we extend this exploration with a former monk -- a renounced renunciant who returned to relate the wisdom gleaned for the betterment of all.</p><p>Meet&nbsp;<strong>Jay Shetty.</strong></p><p>If that name rings a bell, it's likely due to his social media omnipresence. With a global following in excess of 20 million people, Jay has a knack for creating what he calls&nbsp;<em>viral wisdom --&nbsp;</em>snackable videos based on ancient tenets that have surpassed 7 billion views -- making him one of the most viewed people on the internet.</p><p>A graduate of Cass Business school with an honors degree in Behavioral Science, Jay has been named one of <em>Forbes</em> magazine’s 30-under-30. He's been invited to keynote at companies like Google, Microsoft, and Facebook. He is the host of the popular <em>On Purpose&nbsp;</em>podcast. And the occasion for today’s conversation is Jay’s new book,&nbsp;<em>Think Like A Monk</em> --- a distillation of the timeless wisdom learned during his ascetic days on an ashram into practical tools we can all use to live a less anxious, more meaningful life.</p><p>Today the man Russell Brand (<a href=\"https://www.richroll.com/podcast/russell-brand-448/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">RRP 448</a>) calls <em>'a cat-eyed mystic'</em> shares his story.</p><p>This is a conversation about Jay's most unusual journey. His decision to shirk the predictable post-college path and instead move to India. The three-year exploration of austerity that indelibly changed his worldview. His decision to return home, fueled by a desire to make an impact. And the most remarkable path that followed.</p><p>We discuss the insights he gleaned along the way -- and the many tools freely available to underscore our lives with greater meaning and purpose.</p><p>Among many other subjects, we explore the plausibility of conscious capitalism. The double-edged sword of social media. And how to use commerce and attention for good. To spread love. Encourage laughter. And arouse souls from the waking dream that defines the lives of far too many.</p><p><strong>Note:&nbsp;</strong>This was taped pre-pandemic over 6 months ago, when the world was a very different place. Coronavirus delayed the original release of Jay’s book from Spring to Fall, so I agreed to hold on publishing this episode until now.</p><p>You can watch it all go down (in my original home studio) on <a href=\"http://bit.ly/jayshetty544\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube.</a> And as always, the audio version streams wild and free on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bit.ly/rrpitunes\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Podcasts</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bit.ly/rrpspotify\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Spotify.</a></p><p>This conversation is more than just whimsical ramblings. Jay’s methods for mindfulness and self-actualization are evidence-based and platitude-free. Just perceptions and practical takeaways you can adopt right now that will positively reconfigure your reality.</p><p>I sincerely hope you enjoy the exchange.</p><p><strong>Peace + Plants,</strong></p><p><img src=\"http://www.richroll.com/wp-content/uploads/2014/11/RR-SIGNATURE-FOR-WEB-1101.png\"></p><p><strong>Listen, Watch & Subscribe</strong></p><p><a href=\"http://bit.ly/rrpitunes\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Podcasts</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"http://youtube.com/richroll\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">YouTube</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bit.ly/rrpspotify\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Spotify</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bit.ly/rrpstitcher\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Stitcher</a>&nbsp;|&nbsp;<a href=\"http://bit.ly/rrpgoogle\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Google Podcasts</a></p><p><strong>Thanks to this week’s sponsors</strong></p><p><strong>Native:&nbsp;</strong>Safe, effective protection against odor & wetness.
