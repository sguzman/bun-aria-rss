  "description": "With just a month left, the California recall election is looking a little too close for comfort for Democrats. Governor Gavin Newsom’s approval rating is doing alright at the moment, but because of the way California conducts its recalls, if more than 50% of voters vote to oust Newsom, he loses his office, and whichever candidate garners even a small plurality of votes becomes his replacement.\n\nHow likely is it that California swears in a new executive next month? And how would the state fare under potential new leadership?\n\nGuest: Guy Marzorati, politics and government reporter for KQED. \n\nIf you enjoy this show, please consider signing up for Slate Plus.
