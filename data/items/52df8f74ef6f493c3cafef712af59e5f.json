  "description": "<p>The biggest day of the year for retailers is Black Friday. However, over the years the day hasn’t become as big for mom & pop, brick and mortar retailers. It’s about to get a lot worse for the cigar industry industry if the government has it’s way. With H.R. 2339 looming the end of online cigar sales could be coming which could lead to the rebirth brick & mortar shops.</p>\n<p>During the first hour of the show we will each pick a cigar from the Contenders Pack in a fantasy style draft. Who will get the first pick overall, and what will be the first cigar selected. While in the second hour we will do the same with the remaining three as we add the reigning Cigar of the Year; Aganorsa Leaf Connecticut to the mix.</p>\n<p>If you listened the last few weeks, Mr. J has been begging for time to go through the massive pile of emails. Dave grants his wish in the final half hour of the show.</p>\n<p>We will have this all the usual suspects including Versus, Offer of the Day, Cigar News and a peek into the Asylum. The Cigar Authority is a member of the United Podcast Network and is recorded live in front of a studio audience at Studio 21 Podcast Cafe upstairs at Two Guys Smoke Shop in Salem, NH and as always you can find many of the cigars we discuss at <a href='https://www.2guyscigars.com/'>http://www.2GuysCigars.com/</a>.</p>\n<p>Never miss an episode by subscribing to the show via <a href='http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-cigar-authority/id413869893?mt=2&ign-mpt=uo%3D4'>Apple Podcasts</a> and <a href='http://thecigarauthority.podbean.com/'>Podbean</a>.</p>\n",
