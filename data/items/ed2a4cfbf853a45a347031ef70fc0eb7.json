    "media:description": "SUBSCRIBE to Truly: http://bit.ly/Oc61Hj\n\nADEA, from Montreal, Canada is a full-time content creator who makes educational videos about being transgender. Initially, Adea’s huge TikTok following didn’t know she was trans, however, when she came out in 2018 she lost a staggering 50,000 followers. \"I was really shook\", she said. However, this did not dent her resolve to help others and the influencer made weekly videos on her feminisation surgical journey. \"All the hate I got and all the followers I lost didn't do anything to my goal to educate people because I know how it has saved my life and it could save a lot more people's lives.\" Adea came out when she was 16 years old, and faced some judgement from the community around her, \"especially where I live people are not aware of what being trans is, they think it's like a man in a wig\", she explained. \"I was depressed growing up and I never really felt happy. As soon I knew what being trans was I knew that was me and I was in the wrong body.\" In this episode of Shake My Beauty Adea speaks to her dad about how he felt when she first came out and how their relationship has changed over that journey. \n\nVideographer: Paul van den Boom\nProducers: Bethan Kapur, Tom Buckman\nEditor: Emma Mitchell\n\nTruly is on TikTok! https://www.tiktok.com/@truly_show\n\nNow you can watch our videos in Spanish!:  http://bit.ly/Suscribirse_truly_ES\n\nClick here to follow your favourite Truly shows on Instagram! \nTruly - https://www.instagram.com/trulyshow\nBorn Different - https://www.instagram.com/borndifferentshow/\nShake My Beauty - https://www.instagram.com/shakemybeauty/\nHooked On The Look - https://www.instagram.com/hookedonthelookshow/\nLove Don't Judge - https://www.instagram.com/lovedontjudgeshow/\nBeastly - https://www.instagram.com/beastlyshow/\nRidiculous Rides - https://www.instagram.com/ridiculousridesshow/\nDog Dynasty - https://www.instagram.com/dogdynastyshow/\n\nFor more amazing content, click here!\nBeastly: https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9LxuffQCm_Z4KBCoXZvSHA\nBarcroft Cars: https://www.youtube.com/user/BarcroftCars/featured",
