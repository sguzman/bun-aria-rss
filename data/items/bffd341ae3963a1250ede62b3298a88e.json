  "description": "<p>Bi-encoder architectures for distantly-supervised relation extraction are\ndesigned to make use of the complementary information found in text and\nknowledge graphs (KG). However, current architectures suffer from two\ndrawbacks. They either do not allow any sharing between the text encoder and\nthe KG encoder at all, or, in case of models with KG-to-text attention, only\nshare information in one direction. Here, we introduce cross-stitch\nbi-encoders, which allow full interaction between the text encoder and the KG\nencoder via a cross-stitch mechanism. The cross-stitch mechanism allows sharing\nand updating representations between the two encoders at any layer, with the\namount of sharing being dynamically controlled via cross-attention-based gates.\nExperimental results on two relation extraction benchmarks from two different\ndomains show that enabling full interaction between the two encoders yields\nstrong improvements.\n</p>",
