  "description": "We are nearing the end of the year and have for you a best-of-2016 podcast featuring an array of American politics books. Some of these books were featured on the podcast this year, but most are just new and really interesting. Another best-of is underway for political science books in other subfields.\n\nJulia Azari from Marquette University starts us out with two books: Michael Tesler’s, Post-Racial or Most-Racial (University of Chicago Press, 2016), and Katherine Cramer’s, The Politics of Resentment (University of Chicago Press, 2016). Cramer came on the podcast to talk about her book on Wisconsin when it came out.\n\nSean McElwee from Demos then describes Eric Schickler’s book, Racial Realignment (Princeton, 2016). Schickler also visited the podcast in August to talk about his book.\n\nNext up is Lee Drutman from New America, who describes Democracy for Realists by Christopher Achen and (Princeton, 2016), and then Lilly Goren of Carroll University discusses Asymmetric Politics (Oxford, 2016) by Dave Hopkins and Matt Grossmann.\n\nLater in the podcast, Candis Watts Smith from the University of North Carolina talks about The Race Whisperer (NYU Press, 2016) by Melanye Price. And, Jason McDaniel from San Francisco State University finishes off this episode of the podcast talking about White Backlash by Marisa Abrajano & Zoltan L. Hajnal (Princeton, 2015).\n\nI hope you enjoy and please share your favorite new books in political science with me on Twitter @heathbrown with #fav2016poliscibooks.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
