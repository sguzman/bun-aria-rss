  "description": "<p>Better know a podcast host! Oftentimes here on the podcast we talk about our daily lives. We’ll share little ways that we’re saving money, or you get to hear about our curb alert scores, and we might even talk a little too much about how much we’re riding our bikes. So if you’ve been listening for a few years you might know a good bit about us- that happens after 463 episodes! But we’ve never done a deep-dive origin story on the show and what better time to do that than here at the beginning of the year. So during this episode you’ll get to learn all about Joel’s money origin story- favorite jobs as a kid, how a bankruptcy shaped his early perceptions of personal finance, switching colleges to avoid taking on more student loans, his splurge as a single professional, and pursuing financial independence through investing in real estate.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Woodland Pursuit by Humble Forager!
