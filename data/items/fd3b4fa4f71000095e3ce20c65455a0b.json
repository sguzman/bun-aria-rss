The Knicks have been mentioned as a possible landing pad for the Golden State Warriors star and former MVP, who has said he's tired of free-agent speculation. Also discussed is broadcaster Bob Costas's take that he was removed from the Super Bowl telecast because of his comments regarding football and head trauma. Also talked about was the debut of the Alliance of American football, which posted a strong TV rating for its inaugural games. The season lasts 10 weeks. </p><p>Hosts: Scott Soshnick, Michael Barr and Eben Novy-Williams</p><p>Producer: Madena Parwana</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
