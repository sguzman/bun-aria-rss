    "media:description": "Spain is building an $8.7 billion USD new urban development in northern Madrid, called Madrid Nuevo Norte. Madrid is the heart of Spain. However, in its north, train tracks and the urban void surrounding them cut the city right in half, creating traffic and connectivity issues. To solve this issue, Spain is building a new urban development with sparkling skyscrapers and affordable housing on the land. It will host the tallest building in Spain, countless office buildings, world-class infrastructure, and 10,500 new housing units. The project, called Madrid Nuevo Norte, is planned to boost Madrid’s GDP by 18.3 billion euros and help alleviate the city’s housing shortage. However, it also does come with some controversy. Some criticize it as a private, profit-motivated scheme that will increase Madrid’s income gap. In addition, some are unhappy with the construction the project will bring. Nevertheless, it is advancing quickly and construction is set to begin in late-2021.\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, please consider subscribing for more great content!\n\nThank you to the following sources!\n\nInformation\nhttps://distritocastellananorte.com/project/?lang=en’\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Madrid_Nuevo_Norte\nhttps://www.auraree.com/real-estate-news/madrid-nuevo-norte-will-generate-e13-2bn-of-business-for-the-re-sector/\nhttps://thecorner.eu/news-spain/spain-economy/madrid-to-build-the-largest-urban-project-in-europe-over-the-next-decade/88191/\nhttps://distritocastellananorte.com/below-market-rate-housing-will-play-a-prominent-role-in-madrid-nuevo-norte/?lang=en\nhttps://www.web24.news/u/2020/03/the-first-residents-of-madrid-nuevo-norte-will-arrive-in-2023.html\nhttps://distritocastellananorte.com/elproyecto/zonas-verdes-y-dotaciones/?lang=en\nhttps://www.elconfidencial.com/empresas/2017-07-27/operacion-chamartin-cronologia_1421516/\nhttps://www.abitare.it/en/gallery/habitat-en/urban-design-en/rh-estudio-rogers-madrid-nuevo-norte-gallery/?foto=7#gallery\n\nAudio\nStoryblocks\n\nGraphics\nStoryblocks\nGoogle Earth\nDistrito Castellana Norte\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1DsNlsrvcJw\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=mOMoWOP61zo\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=lO_CehL8pMQ",
