    "media:description": "In November 1989, two bands from Manchester appeared together on Top of the Pops and it changed indie music forever. The Madchester sound was the unity of jangly guitars and thumping dance music: big, psychedelic, even funky and a perfect companion to taking Ecstasy. Artists like The Stone Roses, Happy Mondays, Inspiral Carpets, A Guy Called Gerald, 808 State and The Charlatans would bridge this formerly insurmountable musical gap. \n\nIt is the story of punk and disco colliding, how Manchester became for a brief moment the centre of the musical universe, and why Bez is one of the most important figures in British music. This is Before 1989: How Manchester Became Madchester.\n\n#madchester #indiemusic  #musicdocumentary \n\nAdditional Writing & Fact-checking by Serenity Autumn.\n\n00:00 Introduction\n00:51 The Pre-History of Jangle & Funk\n05:00 Punk's Influence on Manchester\n10:17 When Punk Met Funk\n13:02 Orange Juice & Postcard Records\n15:44 New Order & The Haçienda\n18:08 The Phenomenon of The Smiths\n20:27 C86: The Cassette That Changed Indie\n22:52 Chicago House & Acid House\n29:44 Big Audio Dynamite & The Fall\n31:54 Happy Mondays\n35:29 Inspiral Carpets\n37:20 The Stone Roses\n40:14 808 State\n41:48 Primal Scream & Andrew Weatherall\n44:06 Happy Mondays & The Stone Roses on Top of the Pops\n\nSoundtrack\nLuar - Citrine (https://soundcloud.com/luarbeats)\nJesse Gallagher - The Golden Present\nLuar - Anchor (https://soundcloud.com/luarbeats)\n\nYou can also follow me here:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TrashTheory\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TrashTheoryYT\n\nOr support me on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/TrashTheory",
