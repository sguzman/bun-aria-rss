  "itunes:author": "Chanda Prescod-Weinstein",
  "description": "The universe that we know, with its luminous stars and orbiting planets, is largely made up of elements we can't actually see -- like dark energy and dark matter -- and therefore don't fully understand. Theoretical physicist Chanda Prescod-Weinstein takes us inside the search for this cosmos-shaping invisible matter and explains how, with the help of a new generation of telescopes, we could be closer to demystifying it than ever before. \"The universe is more queer and fantastical than it looks to the naked eye,\" she says. (If you want to hear more from Prescod-Weinstein, check out her episode on \"The TED Interview\" podcast.)",
