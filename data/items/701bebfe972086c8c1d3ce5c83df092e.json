  "description": "<p>As we look ahead we ask if the creative space you have suits the artist you want to become and look at some ideas to help you grow.</p>\n<p>This week we're discussing the pros and cons of our different studio set-ups. Louise has a studio in her garden while Alice recently took the leap and rented a large studio away from her home. As our discussion reveals, there are pros and cons to both arrangements. For example, home studios are ultra-convenient and allow for quick pop-ins, while studios away from home can give much more space and also more privacy. We also share some tips for maximising the space you do have and suggest that sometimes there are options we haven't allowed ourselves to consider.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>As you think about your plans for your space, Alice recommends thinking a few years ahead - what kind of artist do you want to be and what kind of space will that artist need? In this episode, we also catch up with what's been happening over the holiday, and share where we are with our planning. Finally, we would like to wish all of you the happiest and most creative of new years and to thank you for your ongoing support.
