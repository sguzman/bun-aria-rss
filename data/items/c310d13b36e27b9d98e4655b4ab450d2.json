Stephen Jackson played fourteen years in the NBA, and he was described by Larry Bird as one of the toughest competitors he ever knew. Yet, throughout his whole career, he was a regular marijuana user. I'll talk to him today about why he found marijuana beneficial, how he managed to evade the system, and his unlikely and close relationship with George Floyd. </p><p>Listen to this episode and let me know what you think.
