  "description": "<p>Scott Soshnick, Eben Novy-Williams and Michael Barr discuss a host of issues related to the business of sports, including what it means for Harvard University’s football program to have one of its former players score a touchdown in the Super Bowl. Former Harvard standout Kyle Juszczyk of the San Francisco 49ers scored in this past weekend’s NFL championship against the eventual champion Kansas City Chiefs, becoming the first Crimson player to record a touchdown on sports’ biggest stage. We discuss what it means for the program with Harvard coach Tim Murphy. Also discussed are Steve Cohen’s pursuit of the New York Mets, which may have hit a snag, the Boston Red Sox’s trade of Mookie Betts to the Los Angeles Dodgers, and the Jacksonville Jaguars decision play two home games in London.</p><p><br></p><p>Hosts: Scott Soshnick, Eben Novy-Williams and Michael Barr</p><p><br></p><p>Producer: Tim Herro</p><p><br></p><p>To contact the reporters on this story:</p><p>Scott Soshnick in New York at <a href=\"mailto:ssoshnick@bloomberg.net\">ssoshnick@bloomberg.net</a>;</p><p>Eben Novy-Williams in New York at <a href=\"mailto:enovywilliam@bloomberg.net\">enovywilliam@bloomberg.net</a>;</p><p>Michael Barr in New York at <a href=\"mailto:mbarr18@bloomberg.net\">mbarr18@bloomberg.net</a></p><p><br></p><p>To contact the editor responsible for this story:</p><p>Scott Soshnick at <a href=\"mailto:ssoshnick@bloomberg.net\">ssoshnick@bloomberg.net</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
