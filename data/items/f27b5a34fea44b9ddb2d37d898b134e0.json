    "media:description": "Having now seen another 4 episodes (6 in total)... I find myself hating Lord of the Rings \"The Rings of Power\" more than almost any other piece of cinema I have ever watched. It is horrible in every sense of the world. Writing, pacing, directing, tension, lore, and accuracy are nothing more than a shallow joke with a total disregard for practically anything that would even remotely make sense. \n\nHow and why this has happened escapes me. With every episode costing as much money as full feature films... the series succeeds in one thing, and one thing alone. Disrespecting the legacy and work of Tolkien.\n\n\n\n\nODYSEE INVITE: https://odysee.com/$/invite/@UpperEchelonGamers:3\n\n\n\n\nPATREON: https://www.patreon.com/UEG\n\n\n\n\nLOCALS: https://upperechelon.locals.com/post/104865/welcome-to-the-upper-echelon-locals-community\n\nhttps://upperechelon.locals.com/support\n\n\n\n\nAxial GT's Channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/AxialGamingTech/videosHuge Thank You.
