  "description": "Daniel and I wrap up 2020 with a wide-ranging discussion... First up, we explain the massive tailwinds behind the surge in cryptos. Even NFL players are now being paid in bitcoin! Turning to the stock market... I explain a simple strategy that can earn you fast gains into 2021... and give a list of companies to pay attention to. Then, we discuss the much-needed stimulus package. This has been a glaring example of how politics get in the way of helping individual citizens. The Georgia Senate election is days away. Here’s what to expect in the markets depending on who wins… Finally, as 2020 comes to an end, I couldn’t be more excited about the security token industry heading into 2021.
