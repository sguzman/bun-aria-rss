  "description": "<p>Katie has always been vigilant about her health. Ever since her husband Jay died of stage four colon cancer in 1998, Katie has been a cancer screening advocate, sharing information about and helping to normalize seemingly intimidating procedures that can detect cancer early and save lives (you might recall Katie’s on-air colonoscopy?). When Katie realized she had missed a mammogram, she decided to take listeners into the procedure room with her to understand why it’s important for women like Katie, who has dense breasts, to get not only a mammogram but also an ultrasound. But then, Katie gets the news that no one wants to get. On this very personal episode, Katie — with the help of her doctors and daughters — takes listeners behind the scenes of her cancer diagnosis, treatment and long term plan. Katie also introduces listeners to cancer survivor and activist, Michele Young, who beat the odds and is changing the breast cancer screening system.<strong> </strong>Also, check out Ellie and Carrie Monahan’s podcast, <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/all-each-other-has/id1629994072\">All Each Other Has</a>, wherever you get your podcasts. </p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
