  "description": "A judge will soon decide if a retired police captain was within his rights to shoot to death a man who threw popcorn at him during an argument over cell phone use in a movie theater. It is the latest controversial case involving Florida’s “stand your ground” law. Curtis Reeves testified that he feared for his life when Chad Oulsen tossed a bucket of popcorn at him. If the judge decides Reeves’ fear  was reasonable, the 75-year-old man will avoid a murder trial. Oulsen’s wife, Nicole, also suffered a wound to her left hand in the shooting. Her lawyer T.J. Grimaldi discusses the case with Nancy Grace in this episode of “Crime Stories.”\n      <p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
