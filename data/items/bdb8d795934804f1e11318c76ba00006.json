We start with the NFC East, followed by the NFC North. Then, we take a halftime break to speak with \"Handsome Hank\" Henry Hodgson about the newly released NFL International Schedule for 2022. After that, the heroes hit the NFC South, and we close the episode with the NFC West. And it definitely only took 48 minutes!</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
