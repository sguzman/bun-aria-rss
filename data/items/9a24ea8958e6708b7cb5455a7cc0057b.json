  "description": "<p>An excellent week for Kirk Minihane and his legion of Minifans. Kirk reviews a Thursday evening packed full of KMS content, which included the debut of the Lady Minifans, a live concert on YouTube, and, unfortunately, the Intern Show. Kirk's old pals at WEEI are happy that he sold out two Wilbur shows -- and perhaps a little envious (0:22:30). Blind Mike takes it to the bank (0:49:10). We have a winner in the Smith's Country Cheese Wilbur Show drawing (0:59:00). Kirk reacts to one of the lesser known shows in the Minifan world (1:29:50). South Park comes under scrutiny for its role in coarsening our public conversations (1:59:24). Mike takes a little trip to the Winchester Public Library to meet an old enemy.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
