  "description": "Today we discuss the family room, and why it is different than the living room, which is usually more dressy and reserved for company and adults. Some houses get rid of the living room and instead have what some would call a great room, one really large scale room, which is open to a kitchen and an open floor plan and could also be considered the family room and the nucleus of the house, where you want to be very comfortable.  We talk about the use of wallpaper and the placement of console tables and how to maximize the its decorating power. We talk about sizing the right rug and how layered rugs can be sophisticated and how your rug is the easiest way to understand your color scheme. There are some tricks to space planning, like drawing the room out and then leaving 18 inches between the sofa and coffee table to make the table usable and the size of your TV needs to be half the length of the distance from your couch to the location of your TV. We also talk about we avoid putting it above your fireplace.  Case goods such as console tables or coffee tables are oftentimes what family rooms are missing. When choosing fabrics, every room needs something woven, or maybe some leather, but use them sparingly. Velvet always goes a long way as well.  When choosing an ottoman, If you're more of a lounging person, you'll want a cocktail ottoman. But if you're more of a dressy type, a table will be better than the ottoman to get a better look for your room. <br /><br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a><br /><br />Living room definition 1:36<br />Family room definition 2:00<br />Grasscloth 3:20<br />Console Tables 10:34<br />Where to start 13:50<br />Case goods 22:05<br />TV’s, Cory’s take 30:00<br /><br />“Often what you’ll see is a sectional and a chair, or two chairs, and they’re like ‘I don’t really know why, it just doesn’t feel finished’ and you’re like ‘Well we need to bring in some tables and some lamps and get you the right throw pillows and a rug.’ It’s just that they got started, but they don’t quite know how to finish and it’s usually that they don’t have any casegoods.
