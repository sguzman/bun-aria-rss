  "description": "<p>The hype around cryptocurrencies has reached a fever pitch. There are Super Bowl ads for crypto companies featuring celebrities like Matt Damon and Larry David. The Staples Center in Los Angeles is now the Crypto.com Arena. And behind that hype is a distinct vision: a more decentralized economy where individuals have more autonomy over their finances, a grass-roots internet free of the not-so-invisible hand of Big Tech, and a cultural ecosystem where artists and musicians can fairly monetize their work.</p><p>But what if that vision is deeply flawed? What if the technology undergirding cryptocurrencies isn’t what it’s cracked up to be? Or what if the technology does work, yet the world it creates isn’t a decentralized utopia but a hyper-financialized dystopia?</p><p>Dan Olson is the creator of a two-hour-YouTube video, “<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=YQ_xWvX1n9g\" target=\"_blank\">Line Goes Up</a>,” that has now been viewed nearly seven million times. “Line Goes Up” is the single most comprehensive critique of crypto that I’ve ever heard. And that’s because Olson isn’t just focused on cryptocurrencies as a technology or an asset class, but on the crypto universe as a distinct culture underpinned by a powerful ideology. It’s easy to think about the lingo, the acronyms and the myths associated with the crypto world as incidental to the value of cryptocurrencies and NFTs as assets. But for Olson, the culture and the currency are inextricably linked. And once you’ve made that connection, suddenly a lot of the problems, warning signs and potential dangers of crypto become visible in a new way.</p><p>Mentioned:</p><p>“<a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2021/10/15/opinion/ezra-klein-podcast-katie-haun.html\" target=\"_blank\">A Crypto Optimist Meets a Crypto Skeptic</a>” from “The Ezra Klein Show”</p><p>“<a href=\"https://hbr.org/2021/11/how-nfts-create-value\" target=\"_blank\">How NFTs Create Value</a>” by Steve Kaczynski and Scott Duke Kominers</p><p><a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/97779/you-are-not-a-gadget-by-jaron-lanier/\" target=\"_blank\">You Are Not a Gadget</a> by Jaron Lanier</p><p>“<a href=\"https://web3isgoinggreat.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Web3 Is Going Just Great</a>” by Molly White</p><p><a href=\"https://lewishyde.com/the-gift/\" target=\"_blank\">The Gift</a> by Lewis Hyde</p><p>Book recommendations:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.robertcaro.com/the-books/the-power-broker/\" target=\"_blank\">The Power Broker</a> by Robert A.
