Her most recent book with Liz Fosslien is called <i>Big Feelings: How To Be Okay When Things Are Not Okay.</i></p><p>In this episode, I talk to Mollie West Duffy about how to navigate big feelings. Our emotion-phobic society has a lot of misconceptions about dealing with difficult emotions and what they mean. According to Mollie, big feelings can lead to a deeper understanding of ourselves if we sit with our emotions and work through them. Mollie and I share our personal experiences with depression and anxiety and how we coped. We also touch on the topics of anger, perfectionism, social comparison, burn out, and uncertainty.</p><p>Website: <a href=\"https://molliewestduffy.com/\">molliewestduffy.com</a></p><p>Twitter: <a href=\"https://mobile.twitter.com/molliewest\">@molliewest</a></p><p> </p><p><strong>Topics</strong></p><p>01:43 Mollie and Liz’s collaborations</p><p>05:08 How Big Feelings was published</p><p>08:31 Our emotion-phobic society </p><p>12:26 Illustrating emotions</p><p>15:13 Myths about big feelings</p><p>18:32 Emotional labor</p><p>21:14 Anxiety, uncertainty, resilience</p><p>25:03 Scott’s tips to manage anxiety</p><p>29:48 Separate the “withins” from the “beyonds”</p><p>32:14 Assess your tolerance of uncertainty</p><p>36:26 Embrace comparison </p><p>43:00 Mollie’s tips to manage depression</p><p>48:30 Translate your anger</p><p>50:43 Perfectionism isn’t as helpful as we think </p>\n",
