Already the RNC files 73 lawsuits in 20 states and democrats and liberal press are claiming Trump is cheating to steal not just the midterms but also the 2024 election.\n\nDespite the revolt from voters Democrats are unwilling to course correct and are continuing to entertain unhinged leftist values that are pushing the gop to victory.\n\n#democrats \n#republicans \n#biden \n\nBecome A Member And Protect Our Work at http://www.timcast.com\n\nMy Second Channel - https://www.youtube.com/timcastnews\nPodcast Channel - https://www.youtube.com/TimcastIRL\n\nMerch - http://teespring.com/timcast\n\nMake sure to subscribe for more travel, news, opinion, and documentary with Tim Pool everyday.",
