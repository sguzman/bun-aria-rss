  "title": "Hi-Phi Nation: Cannibals",
  "description": "In our final episode on monsters, we investigate why people who eat people are the funkiest people in the afterlife. We talk to a man who has actually eaten parts of other people, many times, about why he thinks consuming human flesh should be normalized. We then consider the age-old question of how God is supposed to resurrect a cannibal and all of his victims when most of the flesh of the victims would also be a part of the cannibal. Some of the best minds in Western philosophy and Christian theology thought about this question, including Leibniz, Aquinas, and Augustine. Co-hosted by Christina van Dyke, featuring artist and cannibal Rick Gibson and philosopher Dean Zimmerman.\nSign up for Slate Plus at slate.com/hiphiplus for ad free feeds to all Slate podcasts and unlimited reading of articles at slate.com.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
