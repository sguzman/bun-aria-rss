They also discuss misrepresentations of Dickens as a social reformer, the allegorical and fairy tale elements of his works, and what keys to look for as you read through <em>Hard Times</em>. Thomas talks about Utilitarianism in educational reform, and Cindy highlights the ideas of Charlotte Mason in connection with Victorian times. Angelina brings out the references to imagination in these first chapters and the danger of distorting the child’s imagination.</p> <p>Purchase the recordings of our 2022 Back to School Conference at <a href= \"https://morningtimeformoms.com/events/1758-2/\">MorningTimeforMoms.com</a>.
