Julie made a generous donation to the Collective Power Fund at the National Network of Abortion Funds, and in doing so, got to pick the episode topic — Books that Bang!  </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Headphones in, y’all. We have sixty-nine (that’s right, 69, by pure unplanned luck!) recommendations for you this week — everything from bonkers to bloody to blazing hot…naughty bits that we believe deliver the whole banana (and sometimes no banana at all, if you know what we mean). Pencils ready…your time starts…now.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Thanks to Melissa McTernan, author of <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3xsqb9q\"><em>Married to the Fae Queen</em></a>, the second book in the Fairy Realm series, for sponsoring the episode.

Check your content warnings and remember this one is from 1991, so we don’t even know, honestly. We’re flying without a net here.

It is not too late to donate to the <a href=\"https://abortionfunds.org/collective-power-fund/\">Collective Power Fund at the National Network of Abortion Funds</a>.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">While we name checked some Fated Mates classic recommendations like <a href=\"https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2020/2/24/s0225-asking-for-trouble\">Tessa Bailey</a>, <a href=\"https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2020/12/31/jessa-kane-new-years-eve-extravaganza\">Jessa Kane</a>, and <a href=\"https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2022/3/1/s0424-the-london-hale-oeuvre\">London Hale</a>, somehow we recorded this episode without once mentioning the name of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Charlotte_Stein\">Charlotte Stein</a>. So raise a glass to her and all the other authors writing super hot books that we forgot to mention.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Probably you want to see <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JenniferRNN/status/999411356116938753?s=20&t=AJvktTXRFqBfZ9j_pD9XiQ\">Jen Porter's illustrations</a> of the drilldo. (PS. Protip: you might put \"drilldo\" in the search field of twitter thinking that Jen's tweets will come up, and that would be a mistake unless you want to see it real and in action. Ask me how I know.)</p>",
