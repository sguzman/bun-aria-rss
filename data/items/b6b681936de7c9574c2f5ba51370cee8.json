  "description": "Like all great trilogies throughout history, the Hot Boyz saga has reached its inevitable, fiery conclusion. But not before Jimmy and Larry dial in their old pal—world famous, yet incredibly humble food and game show personality—Sean Evans. The Beautiful Bald Bitch™ himself is locked and loaded, spitting spicy takes on being a cozy boy at heart, soccer goon stolen valor, accidental shopping with Joe Budden, having sex vs. just vibing in a beanbag chair, surfing the wave of life as a simple man, digging in the kicks crates, living in Scottie Pippen’s crib, Netflix shooting 100% on true crime, a window into mook culture, what it’s like eating out as a food icon, his shoestring wardrobe budget, balancing the high with the low and more much on this episode of The Only Podcast That Matters™.\n \nFor more Throwing Fits, check us out on Patreon: www.patreon.com/throwingfits.\n",
