  "description": "In November of 2017, a 24-year-old Nebraska woman matched with another woman on Tinder, and the pair hit it off. But after a second date, she disappeared without a trace. Massive searches took place, but it wasn’t until a friend of the missing woman catfished a suspect on Tinder for information that the details started to come to light. Between witchcraft sex cults, a spree of crimes that weaved through multiple states, and an unlikely relationship, this case truly is as bizarre as it is tragic. This is the story of Sydney Loofe.\nYOUTUBE VIDEO OF AUBREY AND BAILEY\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?time_continue=1&v=S7mELOc57Qg&feature=emb_title\nBONUS EPISODES\npatreon.com/goingwestpodcast\nLearn more about your ad choices.
