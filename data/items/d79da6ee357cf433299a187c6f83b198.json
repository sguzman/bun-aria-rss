Meanwhile, Vox will be building something new and better atop this show's DNA in this feed.\n\nIn this episode, I wanted to reflect on the almost five years I’ve spent doing this show. This project has changed my work, and my life, in unexpected ways. So here are the four lessons this show has taught me and, of course, the three books that have influenced me, and that I'd recommend to the audience. \n\nThank you for everything, and you can reach me at ezrakleinshow@gmail.com.
