  "description": "This episode is all about the two major kinds of dreams and the sorts of learning and unlearning they are used for. I discuss REM-associated dreams that control emotional learning and their similarity to various trauma treatments such as ketamine and EMDR. I also discuss Non-REM dreams and their role in motor learning and learning of detailed, non-emotionally-laden information. I relate this to science-backed tools for accessing more of the types of sleep and learning people may want. Other topics are listed in the time stamps below.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Introduction\n(00:03:00) The Dream Mask\n(00:06:00) Cycling Sleep\n(00:08:10) Chemical Cocktails of Sleep\n(00:13:00) Motor Learning\n(00:16:30) High Performance with Less Sleep\n(00:17:45) Rapid Eye Movement Sleep\n(00:20:30) Paralysis & Hallucinations\n(00:23:35) Nightmares\n(00:24:45) When REM & Waking Collide\n(00:25:00) Sleeping While Awake\n(00:26:45) Alien Abductions\n(00:29:00) Irritability\n(00:30:00) Sleep to Delete\n(00:32:25) Creating Meaning\n(00:34:10) Adults Acting Like Children\n(00:36:20) Trauma & REM\n(00:37:15) EMDR\n(00:39:10) Demo\n(00:44:25) Ketamine / PCP\n(00:45:45) Soup, Explosions, & NMDA\n(00:48:55) Self Therapy\n(00:50:30) Note About Hormones\n(00:51:40) Measuring REM / SWS\n(00:53:15) Sleep Consistency\n(00:56:00) Bed Wetting\n(00:58:00) Serotonin\n(00:59:00) Increasing SWS\n(00:59:50) Lucidity\n(01:02:15) Booze / Weed\n(01:03:50) Scripting Dreams\n(01:04:35) Theory of Mind\n(01:07:55) Synthesis\n(01:10:00) Intermittent Sleep Deprivation\n(01:11:10) Snoring Disclaimer\n(01:11:40) New Topic\n(01:15:50) Corrections\n(01:17:25) Closing Remarks\nAs always, thank you for your interest in science!\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",
