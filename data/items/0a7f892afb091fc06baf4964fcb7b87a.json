  "description": "In the summer of 1988, a Chicago-based journalist left the city life to write a novel in a small, Colorado mining town. After he arrived, he opened up an antique shop and discovered that the previous tenant had disappeared the year prior. But while he began investigating the mans disappearance for his book, he disappeared himself. And this led to one of the biggest searches in Colorado history. This is the story of Keith Reinhard. *BONUS EPISODES* patron.com/goingwestpodcast *CASE SOURCES* https://www.ancestry.com/1940-census/usa/Illinois/Keith-R-Reinhard_53gt65 https://www.chicagotribune.com/news/ct-xpm-2001-11-25-0111250214-story.html https://clustrmaps.com/person/Reinhard-aiff98 https://charleyproject.org/case/keith-r-reinhard https://unsolved.com/gallery/keith-reinhard/ https://www.strangeoutdoors.com/mysterious-stories-blog/keith-reinhard https://www.darksidedoc.com ( https://www.darksidedoc.com/ ) https://www.chicagotribune.com/entertainment/tv/ct-ent-keith-reinhard-travel-channel-lost-in-the-wild-20200109-qlumhdkyvzeidj7xdlo5ugorh4-story.html https://unsolvedmysteries.fandom.com/wiki/Keith_Reinhard https://medium.com/the-mystery-box/journalist-who-disappeared-while-writing-novel-about-missing-person-case-a85615784998 https://echoespath.com/keith-reinhard/ Advertising Inquiries: https://redcircle.com/brands Privacy & Opt-Out: https://redcircle.com/privacy\nLearn more about your ad choices.
