  "description": "Welcome to The Academic Life! In this episode you’ll hear about:\n\nWhat inspired Professor Sumner to study wasps.\n\nThat time she ate a slug.\n\nHer grad school research trip to study wasps in the Malaysian rainforest.\n\nThe complex and varied roles wasps play in the natural world.\n\nThe importance of approaching the natural world with endless curiosity.\n\n\nToday’s book is: Endless Forms: The Secret World of Wasps, which explores these much-maligned insects’ secret world, their incredible diversity and complex social lives, and reveals how they hold our fragile ecosystem in balance. Everyone worries about the collapse of bee populations. But what about wasps? Deemed the gangsters of the insect world, wasps are winged assassins with formidable stings. But do wasps deserve this reputation? Wasps are nature’s most misunderstood insect: as predators and pollinators, they keep the planet’s ecological balance in check. They are nature’s pest controllers; a world without wasps would be just as ecologically devastating as losing the bees, or beetles, or butterflies. \nOur guest is: Seirian Sumner, who is a professor of behavioral ecology at University College London, where she studies the ecology and evolution of social insects. She has published over seventy papers in scientific journals and has received numerous awards for her work, including a L’Oréal-UNESCO for Women in Science Award, a Points of Light Award from the UK prime minister, and a Silver Medal from the Zoological Society of London. She is a fellow and trustee of the Royal Entomological Society and cofounder of the citizen science initiative Big Wasp Survey. Sumner lives in Oxfordshire, England, with her husband and three children. She is the author of Endless Forms: The Secret World of Wasps (HarperCollins, 2022).\nOur host is: Dr. Christina Gessler, who is the co-producer of the Academic Life.\nListeners to this episode may also be interested in:\n\n\nPests: How Humans Create Animal Villains by Bethany Brookshire\n\n\nSilent Earth: Averting the Insect Apocalypse by Dave Goulson\n\n\nSilent Spring by Rachel Carson\n\n\nCity of Sinners by A. A. Dhand\n\nS. Sumner et al, “Why We Love Bees and Hate Wasps,” in Ecological Entomology 43 (6): 836-45.\n\n\nNatural History and the Evolution of Paper-Wasps, ed by Stefano Turillazzi and Mary Jane West-Eberhard\n\nYou are smart and capable, but you aren’t an island, and neither are we.
