  "itunes:summary": "In many ways, the campaign trail of the 44th Federal Election has been a campaign unlike any other in Canadian history. Called amidst a resurgence of COVID-19 infection rates due in large part to the delta variant, the campaign has seen the Liberal and Conservative Parties of Justin Trudeau and Erin Oâ€™Toole respectively at dead heat since the drop of the writ, with the only predictable outcome being that the next government of Canada will likely be a minority government.\n\nBut the most pronounced aspect of the campaign may not be its potential outcome, but the ways in which public discontent has been mobilized in fragmented and even violent ways, targeting candidates, their staff and in particular Prime Minister Trudeau himself along the campaign trail. \n\nAs the campaign reached its final days with election day looming just around the corner, we spoke with Professor Jonathan Malloy about the campaign and the prospects ahead for the 44th parliament of Canada. Dr. Malloy is a professor with Carleton Universityâ€™s Department of Political Science specializing in Canadian political institutions, and religion and politics; he is also the current Bell Chair for the study of Canadian Parliamentary Democracy and the Faculty of Public Affairsâ€™ Associate Dean of Research and International.\n\nYou can follow Dr. Malloy on Twitter @JonathanMalloy.\n\nâ€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“\nFollow us on social media:\ninstagram.com/cu_poli.sci\nfacebook.com/carletonu.polisci\ntwitter.com/CU_PoliSci\ncarleton.ca/polisci\n\nThanks so much for listening, and an extra thanks to Sappheiros for use of his music for our theme.\n\nLights by Sappheiros @sappheirosmusic\nCreative Commons â€” Attribution 3.0 Unported â€” CC BY 3.0\nFree Download / Stream: bit.ly/LightsSappheiros\nMusic promoted by Audio Library youtu.be/-lbbHQbZNKg\nâ€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“â€“\nðŸŽµ Track Info:\nTitle: Lights by Sappheiros\nGenre and Mood: Dance & Electronic + Inspirational\nâ€”â€”â€”\nðŸŽ§ Available on:\nSpotify: open.spotify.com/album/4KnoJn...\niTunes: music.apple.com/us/album/ligh...\nDeezer: deezer.com/us/album/88114572\nYouTube: youtube.com/watch?v=xq3_uCEtiJI\nSoundCloud: @sappheirosmusi...\nâ€”â€”â€”\nðŸ˜Š Contact the Artist:\nzachremick1@gmail.com\nsappheiros.bandcamp.com\ndeezer.com/us/artist/13811001\n@sappheirosmusic\nmusic.apple.com/us/artist/sap...\nyoutube.com/channel/UCxLKyBhC...\nopen.spotify.com/artist/5ZVHX...\npaypal.com/paypalme2/sappheiros\ninstagram.com/sappheirosmusic\nfacebook.com/SappheirosMusic\ndiscordapp.com/invite/Pk87yN9\ntwitter.com/SappheirosMusic\npatreon.com/sappheiros",
