  "description": "<p><p>Kirk Minihane got his point across. Today, we recap all the content the Minifans are generating and put a few controversies to rest. The crew talks about the ever growing list things that public figures can't say or they will be run out of town, exhibit A being Don Cherry. Blind Mike has always wanted to run a bar, Minihane has always dreamed of owning a cinema, but Steve Robinson dreams of owning a bed and breakfast. A top-five parody song, Mama Geary's Touch, inspires us all. Steve introduces some classic Maine \"humor\" to the show.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
