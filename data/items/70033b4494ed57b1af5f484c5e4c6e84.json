She is also food photographer, stylist, and the creator of the award-winning blog Apt. 2B Baking Co. We talk to Yossy about the best seasonal fruits for baking, her love of galettes and we have a surprise visit from Sarah Jones, founder of Miss Jones Baking Co. Host Kerry Diamond is also joined by Anita Shepherd of Anita’s Yogurt. Anita was a self-taught pastry chef when she decided to go vegan for health reasons. When a search for decent nondairy yogurt came up short, she tried to make it on her stove at home. After years of experimentation, she launched Anita’s Yogurt in 2013.</p>\n",
