  "description": "<p>How would you like to have an argument?  Turns out that learning how to have a good argument might just be the best way to learn to think critically.  In this episode I discuss a neat piece of research in which 7 and 8 year olds are taught how to effectively argue. And they do a darn good job of it as it turns out.  Perhaps this is the way to teach our young people  critical thinking: give them some great books to read - like The Giving Tree - and have them discuss what they think about it.  The key ingredient: making sure that they fully understand the point of view of the other person.  This'll be fun. I promise.  Especially since I've got a couple funny clips from Monty Python's Argument Clinic sketch to help move things along. </p>",
