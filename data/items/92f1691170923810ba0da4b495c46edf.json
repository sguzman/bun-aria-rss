  "description": "<p>Do you sometimes wish you had a cabinet of counselors you could go to for advice and insight on how to make life better and easier for yourself? <br />Well, my guest today created his own board of mighty mentors — a metaphorical round table of some of the most successful people in the world — and asked them all the same 11 questions on how to live a more fulfilling and productive life. And he wrote a book to share all the insights he learned with others.  <br />His name is Tim Ferriss, and he's an author and the host of the Tim Ferriss Podcast.
