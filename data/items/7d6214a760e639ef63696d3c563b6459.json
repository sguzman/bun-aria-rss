  "description": "On March 19th of last year, Dean Valoras' life changed forever. That is the day he lost his teenage daughter Alexandra to suicide. Alexandra was an intelligent, successful, highly-motivated high school student. Externally she appeared happy and excited for the future, but that did not match how she felt internally. Alexandra kept secret journals where she wrote about feeling like a failure. In this episode, Dean shares the story of Alexandra in hopes of helping others and he discusses his meditation practice and other tools he’s using to help him move forward.\nSuicide Prevention Resources:\nhttp://www.bethe1to.com/\nIf you are struggling with thoughts of suicide or worried about a friend or loved one help is available.\nCall the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-8255 [TALK], or text TALK to 741-741 or visit suicidepreventionlifeline.org - for free confidential emotional support 24 hours a day 7 days a week.\nEven if it feels like it – you are not alone.\nIf a person says they are considering suicide:\nTake the person seriously\nStay with them\nHelp them remove lethal means\nCall the National Suicide Prevention Lifeline at 1-800-273-TALK (8255)\nText TALK to 741741 to text with a trained crisis counselor from the Crisis Text Line for free, 24/7\nEscort them to mental health services or an emergency room\nPlug Zone\nDean Valoras Blog: https://rocktherisingblue.wordpress.com/\nCBS Sunday Morning Special: https://www.cbsnews.com/news/a-lost-girls-diary-alexandra-valoras/\nTen Percent Happier Meditation\nJoseph Goldstein's Self Compassion:\nhttps://10percenthappier.app.link/rl7xRtFOiX\n***VOICEMAILS***\nHave a question for Dan?
