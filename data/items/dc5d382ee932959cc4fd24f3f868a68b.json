  "description": "<p>In Episode 9 of the Being Human is Good For Business Podcast we talk to Trilogy Effect partners Wendy Appel, Heather Marasse and Mary Beth Sawicki about New Year’s Resolutions.</p><p>Initially, we set out to learn about 2021’s top priorities for leaders, but quickly shifted focus. Listen and learn how you can now finally stop striving to be your best self, and instead just relax into being the fabulous person you already are.   </p><p>A great place to begin is to discover your Enneagram type. It’s a framework that describes nine different, fundamental worldviews and their associated patterns of behavior. </p><p>“When a leader gets a little overwhelmed, they often tend to revert to old habits,” explains leadership development expert Heather Marasse. “The Enneagram provides you the means to see the patterning in your internal landscape and supports you in choosing different and more effective ways to respond and behave.”</p><p>Next, try completing the free Leadership Circle Profile online. This can set the stage for your year by identifying where you want to focus your development and growth efforts.</p><p>The Leadership Circle Profile is benchmarked against more than 10,000 global leader assessments to evaluate how you go about achieving results, bringing out the best in others and how much you act with integrity and courage. It will also reveal if you are overly cautious and where you may have self-limiting habits that impede your leadership effectiveness. </p><p>“Our clients find using the Leadership Circle Profile to be hugely enlightening and insightful,” says leadership coach Wendy Appel. “It allows them to see gaps and alignment between how they see themselves and how their teams actually experience working with them.”</p><p>Once you’ve taken the initial steps with the Leadership Circle Profile and Enneagram framework, you’ll have a solid foundation for your ongoing leadership development. Now you need to make a commitment to pursuing it.   </p><p>“You don’t need a self-improvement plan or a fix-it plan,” says executive coach Mary Beth Sawicki. “Because you’re not broken. Taking on your development is a hero’s journey. It requires compassion for yourself and for the process.”</p><p>This journey will help you learn more about who you are, what you want, where you want to spend your time and energy, and what you want to focus your efforts on. In short, you’ll have more agency over your work and your life. </p><p>Learn more by listening to the show.  Here are links to the some of the tools mentioned in the show and other resources to support you in your commitment to your ongoing development as a leader:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://self-assessment.theleadershipcircle.com/en-US/registration\">The Leadership Circle Profile</a> (Free)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Enneagram-Typing-Cards-Wendy-Appel/dp/098488422X\">Enneagram Typing Cards</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/blog/use-enneagram-better-leader\">How to use the Enneagram better to become a leader</a> (Free)</li><li><a href=\"https://youtu.be/iCvmsMzlF7o\">Brené Brown On The Power of Vulnerability</a> (Free)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/InsideOut-Enneagram-Game-Changing-Guide-Leaders/dp/0984884203/ref=pd_sbs_14_1/136-3490425-6103021?_encoding=UTF8&pd_rd_i=0984884203&pd_rd_r=9c87530d-e993-4cd0-981a-4aaa3b5852f9&pd_rd_w=DJ93e&pd_rd_wg=rz6RO&pf_rd_p=de2765fe-65e5-4a88-aaad-a915dea49c67&pf_rd_r=00C3PQV1W88YVKNKWAG5&psc=1&refRID=00C3PQV1W88YVKNKWAG5\">InsideOut Enneagram: The Game Changing Guide for Leaders</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Road-Back-You-Enneagram-Self-Discovery/dp/0830846190/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=The+Road+Back+to+You%3A+An+Enneagram+Journey+to+Self-Discovery&qid=1610656689&s=books&sr=1-1\">The Road Back to You: An Enneagram Journey to Self-Discovery</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Mastering-Leadership-Breakthrough-Performance-Extraordinary/dp/1119147190/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=mastering+leadership&qid=1610656873&s=books&sr=1-1\">Mastering Leadership: An Integrated Framework for Breakthrough Performance and Extraordinary Business Results</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Enneagram-Love-Work-Understanding-Relationships/dp/0062507214/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=the+enneagram+in+love+and+work&qid=1610657127&s=books&sr=1-1\">The Enneagram in Love and Work</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Types-Leadership-Mastering-Century-Workplace/dp/168261638X/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=nine+types+of+leadership&qid=1610657190&sr=8-1\">9 Types of Leadership</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/blog\">Trilogy Effect Blog</a> (Free)</li></ul><p>Please subscribe to the <i>Being Human Is Good for Business Podcast </i>on iTunes, Amazon, Google Podcasts, iHeart Radio and Spotify (links below) or wherever you get your podcasts.
