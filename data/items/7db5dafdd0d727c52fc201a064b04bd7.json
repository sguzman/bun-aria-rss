  "description": "<p>Shane Mauss met me on the patio of the Comedy Store and told me tons of tales about all sorts of psychedelic drugs. I had no idea Shane was this deep into psychedelia. He's been to so many different dimensions he should forward his mail there. And what I really liked is that he wasn't all hippy dippy about it. He's very scientific about the whole thing. It was a great discussion about amazing drugs.</p>",
