We invite Mark onto Darkness Radio to explain why our soul gets an \"upgrade\", what it really does after we die, how it interacts with the quantum realm and quantum physics, and how an Electromagnetic soul might tune itself down to create an EVP!Â </p>\n\n<p>Get Mark's new book, other books, schedule readings, and listen to his podcast here: <a href=\"https://www.afterlifefrequency.com/\">https://www.afterlifefrequency.com/</a></p>\n",
