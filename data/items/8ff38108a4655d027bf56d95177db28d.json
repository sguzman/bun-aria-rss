  "description": "<p>My guest today, Danica Roem, went from fronting a Death Metal band by night while building a career as an accomplished journalist by day, to being the first person to be elected and serve in any U.S. state legislature while openly transgender.</p><br><p>When you hear that story, you might think, “wow, that’s amazing, but I don’t really relate.” Not so fast. When you zoom the lens out, Danica’s story is really about the quest to live as the truest expression of yourself, to not stifle or deny who you are, and to find a sense of home for all parts of you within a community. Which is something nearly all of us often struggle with. I know I do. This is why I was so excited to be in conversation with Danica Roem.&nbsp;</p><br><p>My chat with Danica takes us back to her teenage years, where she first found her community in (what may sound surprising now, but won’t later) metal music. We talk about the struggles of masking the authentic parts of yourself in order to fit in, and how she’s been able to use her experiences to relate with people from all different backgrounds on a human level.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Danica’s new memoir-meets-manifesto, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3H4fLQu\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Burn the Page: A True Story of Torching Doubts, Blazing Trails, and Igniting Change</em></a>, deconstructs the many, sometimes outrageous and deeply isolating and offensive stories her doubters and opponents have thrown at her and shows through brutal honesty how she’s turned her identity, values and experiences into her greatest strengths. She brings that same honesty and authenticity to our conversation today, so know that you’re in for a real treat.&nbsp;</p><br><p>You can find Danica at: <a href=\"https://www.delegatedanicaroem.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a> | <a href=\"https://twitter.com/pwcdanica\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></p><br><p><strong>If you LOVED this episode </strong>you’ll also love the conversations we had with <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/good-life-project/id647826736?i=1000545130048\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Jeffrey Marsh</a> about living into your own sense of identity, unapologetically.&nbsp;</p><br><p><strong>Check out our offerings & partners:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li><strong>My New Book </strong><a href=\"https://sparketype.com/book/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sparked</a> | <strong>My New Podcast </strong><a href=\"https://pod.link/1610198312\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SPARKED</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.goodlifeproject.com/sponsors/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Visit Our Sponsor Page</a> For a Complete List of Vanity URLs & Discount Codes.</li><li><strong>IMPACT:</strong> IMPACT makes it easy to find and invest in companies that share your values, helping to better align your portfolio with the kind of world you want to create.
