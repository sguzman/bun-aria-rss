  "description": "In this episode we define and describe.  space planning and give some examples of how to arrange your space to inspire conversation. Space planning is a critical part of the design process and we find that often architects don’t create the right amount of space for your furniture because they use generalized sizes, not specific to your furniture selections. You’ll want to work with the architects and figure out how much space you'll actually need for your style so that your home can tell your personal story. We talk about how to situate your room depending on what you want your focus to be.  A reoccurring piece of advice is to not let your room get to “leggy,” otherwise everything looks too tall and like it’s about to tip over. To be successful, make sure you are considering the different vantage points in the room and how you want to build the social interactions in the space.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a> <br /><br />What is space planning? 1:54 <br />Fireplace and rugs 8:04<br />Chairs 11:26<br />Space planning for a room with a corner fireplace 19:13<br />How important are sectionals 24:57<br />Indoor trees 29:50<br /><br />“I just wanted to give you guys the permission to not have to have every single thing in a room be comfortable. It doesn’t have to be. There are certain pieces in a room, and this one is probably not the perfect space plan to talk about that, but sometimes you have a little chair by a fireplace and that chair’s job is to be sculptural and beautiful and just fun to look at. Maybe on occasions somebody’s going to go perch there because they’re completing the conversation circle, but it’s really just a perch and its silhouette is just doing its job. Not everything has to sit like a lazy boy. Not everything has to sit like a sectional.” 14:53<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
