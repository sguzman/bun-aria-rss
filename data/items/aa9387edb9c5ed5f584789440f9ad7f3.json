  "description": "That's right, the Red River Ramblin' Rigatoni Ruckus is back, with both teams ranked and looking to grab control of the Big 12. So we talked about weird food and miniature cattle and big ole rabbits. It's also the anniversary of Auburn 3-Mississippi State 2, either Rutgers or Illinois is gonna get a Big 10 win, and Miami will probably unveil some way too sexual prop just to prove they're the manliest man in mandom. Granted, we didn't talk about any of that for the first 15 minutes or so, the designated non-football portion of this podcast. This show will never get any better, no matter how much you or I would like it to. That's fun. This is all fun.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
