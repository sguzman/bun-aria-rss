  "description": "<p>29-year-old Lonene Rogers, or Lonnie, spent January 6, 1981, working as a maid at a hotel. Afterward, she stopped by the babysitter's house to pick up her two young children. Lonnie made it back to her house in Hayfield Township, Pennsylvania. That evening, Lonnie's husband claims that the two had argued. His story was that he last saw Lonnie around 12:45 AM when he went to bed. He awoke in the early morning hours of January 7 to find that Lonnie was gone. Missing along with Lonnie was her coat, jeans, and boots. Other essential items were left behind at the house, including her car, keys, and purse. But this wasn't a night that someone would choose to walk away from their home or take a casual stroll around the neighborhood. It was freezing cold, and a storm blanketed the area with snow. What could have happened to Lonnie? Lonnie is still missing more than 40 years later, and her case remains unsolved.</p><p>Any persons with information regarding Lonnie's disappearance are urged to call Pennsylvania State Police at (814)-332-6911, TTY/TDD (814)-724-2985, or anonymously contact the Pennsylvania Crime Stoppers at 1-800-4PA-TIPS (8477) or online at&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.p3tips.com/tipform.aspx?ID=107\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.p3tips.com/tipform.aspx?ID=107</a>.</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href=\"http://Prose.com/thevanished\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Prose</a>- Take your free in-depth consultation and get 15% off your first order today at <a href=\"http://Prose.com/thevanished\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Prose.com/thevanished</a>.</p><p><a href=\"http://Doordash.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Doordash</a>- For a limited time, our listeners can get 25% off and zero delivery fees on their first order of $15or more, when you download the DoorDash app and enter code&nbsp;<strong><em>VANISHED</em></strong>.</p><p><a href=\"http://Edmunds.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Edmunds</a>- Go to <a href=\"http://Edmunds.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Edmunds.com</a> and click on Edmunds Best Car Rankings to research and compare vehicles.</p><p>If you have a missing loved one that you would like to have featured on the show, please fill out our case submission form:<a href=\"http://www.thevanishedpodcast.com/case-submission/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;http://www.thevanishedpodcast.com/case-submission/</a>.</p><p>Follow The Vanished on social media at:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/thevanishedpodcast/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thevanishedpodcast/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></p><p><a href=\"https://twitter.com/thevanishedpod/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/thevanishedpodcast\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Patreon</a></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
