Over the years horrible men would come into focus as suspects. Men who took the lives of 10-year-old Amanda Ray, 5-year-old Neely Smith, and 15-year-old Kathy Beatty. But it wasn't until a cold case investigator came across a single old report from 1975 (a report that had been there all along) that the case would finally be solved and Mr. & Mrs. Lyon would finally have answers about what happened to their daughters.</p><p> </p><p>For current Fan Club membership options and policies, please visit <a href=\"https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/\">https://crimejunkieapp.com/library/</a>. </p><p>Sources for this episode cannot be listed here due to character limitations.
