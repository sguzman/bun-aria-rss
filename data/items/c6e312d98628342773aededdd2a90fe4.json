  "title": "Cardinals-Cowboys & Chiefs-Bills MNF Recaps: Dallas gets embarrassed, Josh Allen struggles again (Football 10/20)",
  "description": "Double the action, but definitely not double the fun for the Cowboys and Bills on Monday night. To break down 2 MNF games Will Brinson is joined by Ryan Wilson, John Breech and Jared Dubin. The guys start with the lowly Cowboys (1:00), who not only lost, but lost big. Dallas is broken, but how much of the blame should go towards Andy Dalton? Opinions range from the Red Rifle being THE problem to A problem to encouraged by his performance (you'll never guess who that came from). We'll also add that Ezekiel Elliott's fumbles and Mike McCarthy's mere presence did not help matters. On the other side, let's give the Cardinals some credit. Kyler Murray's statline didn't look great, but Arizona connected on some big plays and their defense came to play. Brinson, Wilson, Breech and Dubin then transition to talking about the earlier game featuring a heavy heavy dose of the run game from Kansas City (33:00). KC bounced back from a loss a week ago and eased all concerns after that performance against the Raiders. Meanwhile, Josh Allen disappointed for the second straight week in primetime. He's certainly not in the MVP conversation at the moment and Buffalo might no longer be favorites to win the AFC East.
