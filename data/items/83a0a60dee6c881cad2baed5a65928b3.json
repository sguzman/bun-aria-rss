  "description": "32 teams, 32 podcasts, 1 guest per team. That's the plan for the podcast in June and on this episode we explore the Buffalo Bills with Matthew Fairburn who is a beat writer for The Athletic. Will Brinson asks if the 2020 Bills could resemble the 2019 Browns, but Matthew tosses in another comparison (1:15). You can't talk about Buffalo and their chances as a contender without zeroing in on 3rd-year quarterback Josh Allen and that's exactly what the guys cover for a large portion of the podcast (5:30). They also examine an already good yet still improving defense (13:00), as well as how fans should set their expectations for the team in 2020 (14:45).\nCheck out Matthew's podcast with The Athletic, 'The Buffalo Beat: A show about the Buffalo Bills'\n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nFollow the Pick Six team on Twitter: @picksixpod, @willbrinson, @MatthewFairburn\nCheck out the Pick Six Instagram page https://www.instagram.com/picksixpod/?hl=en\nJoin our Facebook group https://www.facebook.com/groups/758548147935545/\nFor more NFL coverage from CBS Sports, visit https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/\nTo hear more from the CBS Sports Podcast Network, visit https://www.cbssports.com/podcasts/\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
