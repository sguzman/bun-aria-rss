    "media:description": "The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 97 \n\nWe have devoted a lot of time on the New Discourses Podcast to breaking down the work of the Brazilian Marxist \"educator\" Paulo Freire, who proved to be a pivotal figure in the history of Marxism in several ways at once. This work needs to continue, so it will continue. In this episode of the New Discourses Podcast, host James Lindsay offers a summary of what it means to be \"Freirean\" in education, following from his detailed explanation on the Social Justice Encyclopedia, Translations from the Wokish (https://newdiscourses.com/tftw-freirean/). Join him to understand what it means to be Freirean in even greater clarity and detail.\n\nSupport New Discourses: https://newdiscourses.com/support\n\nSubscribe to New Discourses on other platforms: https://newdiscourses.com/subscribe\n\nFollow James Lindsay: https://linktr.ee/conceptualjames\n\n© 2022 New Discourses.
