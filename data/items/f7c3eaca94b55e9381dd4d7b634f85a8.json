  "description": "<p>You can't sell luxury items like art during a global pandemic. This seems to be a widely held belief and yet artists all over the world are discovering that it's not true. In fact, many artists are now selling online for the first time and finding more success than they ever expected. Indeed, we both &nbsp;posted work for sale recently as part of the #artistsupportpledge initiative, and we were both pleasantly surprised by our results. In this episode, we share our experiences and tips for succeeding with online sales during this crisis, discuss the importance of finding marketing strategies that work for you, and chat about ways we can use our art to raise funds for our favourite causes. We also discuss the ways in which this initiative might change how we market our own paintings in the future, and offer advice on what to do if you post work and it doesn't sell right away (spoiler alert: we don't think it's anything to worry about!) And finally, we say goodbye to Louise's (slightly surprising) childhood hero.</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>#artistsupportpledge on Instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/artistsupportpledge/?hl=en\">https://www.instagram.com/explore/tags/artistsupportpledge/?hl=en</a></p>\n<p>Alice's small paintings - sorry - all sold out!</p>\n<p>Louise's small paintings: <a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/small-works/\">https://www.louisefletcherart.com/small-works/</a></p>\n<p>Norman Hunter: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awoxabZSS9c\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=awoxabZSS9c</a></p>\n<p><strong>Sign up for our newsletters at:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\">bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</a></p>\n<p>Buy us a coffee at: <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\">https://ko-fi.com/artjuice</a></p>\n<p><strong>Follow us on Instagram:</strong></p>\n<p>Follow Alice on Instagram <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com@alicesheridanstudio/\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p>or Louise <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p><em>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</em></p>\n<p><br></p>\n",
