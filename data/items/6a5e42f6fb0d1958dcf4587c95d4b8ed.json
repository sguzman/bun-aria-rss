  "description": "Brett Kahr has done it again! He has given us a marvelous book, helpful, yet challenging, fun to read, yet digging deep. In How to Flourish as a Psychotherapist (Phoenix Publishing House, 2018) he takes us on a journey through the life cycle of the psychoanalyst – from first thoughts about training and the basic personal requirements for a life in the mental health professions to thriving inside and outside of the consulting room to packing up your practice at the end of your career. In his typical lucid and accessible style, he gives generous examples from his own path to show us how we can make the most of our life in the field. But this trip is not for the faint of heart: Professor Kahr is a demanding tour guide, urging us to dive deep into the work and taking seriously our scholastic history, a paternal voice that tells us about the amazing things we can do with our specialized knowledge – if we apply ourselves and work hard. As any paternal voice ought to in this day and age, the book will surely provoke strong reactions in many readers and listeners. Join us for an in-depth discussion of the book and the profession.\nThis interview was conducted in front of an online live audience as part of a new series of events hosted by the Free Association, a group of psychoanalytic candidates based in the beautiful city of Lisbon, Portugal, creating innovative opportunities of continuous learning in the field of psychodynamic psychotherapy and psychoanalysis. This conversation is part of a new format titled „Forward“, in which I interview exciting psychoanalytic scholars about their work. After the interview – and this is special about Forward - there is an extended discussion with the audience, which you will not hear in this recording. Check out the website of the Free Association for future events at \nwww.freeassociation.pt.\nSebastian Thrul is a psychiatrist and psychoanalyst in training in Germany and Switzerland. He can be reached at sebastian.thrul@gmx.de.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
