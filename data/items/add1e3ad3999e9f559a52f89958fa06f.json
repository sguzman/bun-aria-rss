  "description": "We recently celebrated the resurrection of Jesus in an Easter service, and now I want to encourage you to not just celebrate His resurrection but live the resurrection life He came to give us. How do we live this resurrection life? We have to take hold of everything Jesus has given us through His death and resurrection. He took your sin and shame, everything that would ever try to come on you, and He paid your debt in full. “He has removed our sins as far from us as the east is from the west” (Psalm 103:12). We don’t have to walk in guilt and condemnation. We are free to go and live the resurrection life.<p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
