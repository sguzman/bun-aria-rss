  "description": "<span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">When you’re afraid, it’s so helpful to rehearse God’s word. But it can be hard to find a quiet place, or even time, to read and think about what God’s promises mean for your situation. Moms have a lot of demands on their time, so we’ve put together an entire episode designed to help you meditate on God’s word. In this episode, Emily reads a collection of scriptures on fear. So whether you’re scrubbing toilets, driving to work, or even on a walk, we pray these scriptures lift your eyes to the Lord as you face your fears.</span> <p>____</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" data-test-bidi=\"\">We’re so thankful for Crossway, publisher of the ESV Scripture Journals, for helping make this mini-series possible! Pairing individual books of the Bible with blank pages, you can journal as you read, listen to a sermon, or study the Bible. Now through March 31, 2021, Risen Motherhood listeners can pick up the black or Illuminated ESV Scripture Journals for forty percent off with a free Crossway+ membership.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" data-test-bidi=\"\">____</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" data-test-bidi=\"\">Sign up for Risen Motherhoods' <a href=\"risenmotherhood.com/newsletter\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">email list</a> for your free Fear downloads!</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" data-test-bidi=\"\">Find all of the links and related resources from our Fear series <a href= \"risenmotherhood.com/fear\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">here</a>.</p> <p dir=\"ltr\" data-test-bidi=\"\">Risen Motherhood on <a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/risenmotherhood/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Instagram</a>, <a href= \"https://www.facebook.com/risenmotherhood\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Facebook</a>, & <a href= \"twitter.com/risenmotherhood/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Twitter.</a></p>",
