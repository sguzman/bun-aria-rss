  "description": "<p><p>Fastest 2 minutes for the NFL Divisional Round (2:29 - 6:17). Recapping each game, the Eagles ran out of gas, the Patriots kicked the shit out of the Chargers, Jared Goff has wheels and Patrick Mahomes is incredible, even if he points for first downs too much (6:17 - 31:30). Stat of the Day and Who's back of the week including PFT and Big Cat watching the Game of Thrones preview even though they don't watch Game of Thrones (31:30 - 52:05). Coach Eric Mangini joins the show to talk about Divisional Round, stopping Patrick Mahomes, how teams can get overhyped for the playoffs, and what he learned as a young NFL Coach that other young coaches need to watch out for (52:05 - 76:57). Segments include way to stay relevant baseball for Kyler Murray, Mike Greenberg's Dumb Rules, and Hank has an AMAZING Drunk Idea that will make us insanely rich.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
