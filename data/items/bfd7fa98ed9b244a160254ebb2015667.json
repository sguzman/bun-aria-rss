  "description": "Studying the forces behind and the implications for education’s ascension as a predominant global phenomenon is becoming a more important, yet convoluted, endeavor. Envisioned as a way to succinctly encapsulate this narrative, Robin Shields, Senior Lecturer in the Higher Education Management at the University of Bath, has written Globalization and International Education (Bloomsbury Academic, 2013) in the Contemporary Issues in Education Studies series. Beginning with the first conceptions of development by the colonial powers, through the modernization theories prevalent through the Cold War, and to the expansion of the mass knowledge economy of today, Shields’ book chronicles the historical and contemporary challenges or issues in this field through case studies and easy-to-follow theoretical summaries. The book provides for a useful handbook for this expansive and complicated field, perfect for students, educators, or anyone else interested in international and comparative education or development.\n\nDr. Shields joins New Books in Education for the interview and you can follow him on Twitter at @robinshields.
