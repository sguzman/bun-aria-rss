  "description": "<p>Harvest seeds of growth. Ending relationships is never easy. But it’s a part of life. Not all relationships last, but it’s how we end them that makes all the difference. You can use the opportunity to plant seeds that better your future, or you can plant bitter seeds that will bloom into hatred and rage. You make the decision. It is possible to consciously uncouple. For this Five Minute Friday, I revisited a conversation I had with Katherine Woodward where she explained the best way to end a relationship. Katherine Woodward Thomas, M.A., MFT is the author of the New York Times Bestseller Conscious Uncoupling: 5 Steps to Living Happily Even After, which was nominated for a Books for a Better Life Award, and the national bestseller, Calling in “The One:” 7 Weeks to Attract the Love of Your Life. She is also a licensed marriage and family therapist and teacher to thousands from all corners of the world in her virtual and in-person learning communities. Katherine teaches us to understand our feelings and gives us techniques to release them.<br />\nIn This Episode You Will Learn:<br />\nAbout “affect labeling” or naming your feelings (2:00)<br />\nThe practice of Tonglen (3:55)<br />\nHow to harvest the seeds of growth that are underneath our emotions (4:30)<br />\nAbout the concept of Karma (5:20)</p>\n",
