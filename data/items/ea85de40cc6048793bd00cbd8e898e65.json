The reality is that in order to be successful, you have to produce more than you consume. Jemal shared that “The real value in life is the unseen work being done,” while ET added that “You take the rich (resources) that are around you, and produce wealth with them.” This episode really shows the value of putting in the work, because producing equals longevity.",
