  "description": "<p>Topic taxonomies display hierarchical topic structures of a text corpus and\nprovide topical knowledge to enhance various NLP applications. To dynamically\nincorporate new topic information, several recent studies have tried to expand\n(or complete) a topic taxonomy by inserting emerging topics identified in a set\nof new documents. However, existing methods focus only on frequent terms in\ndocuments and the local topic-subtopic relations in a taxonomy, which leads to\nlimited topic term coverage and fails to model the global topic hierarchy. In\nthis work, we propose a novel framework for topic taxonomy expansion, named\nTopicExpan, which directly generates topic-related terms belonging to new\ntopics. Specifically, TopicExpan leverages the hierarchical relation structure\nsurrounding a new topic and the textual content of an input document for topic\nterm generation. This approach encourages newly-inserted topics to further\ncover important but less frequent terms as well as to keep their relation\nconsistency within the taxonomy. Experimental results on two real-world text\ncorpora show that TopicExpan significantly outperforms other baseline methods\nin terms of the quality of output taxonomies.\n</p>",
