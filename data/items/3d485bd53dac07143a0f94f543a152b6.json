  "title": "The Best Of Mark Levin - 6/18/22",
  "description": "The stock market has tanked and the Federal Reserve is raising interest rates again because they miscalculated and subsidized massive deficit spending. The Democrats, without a single Republican vote, passed the largest deficit-spending bill in American history. Before that, 19 Republicans voted with the Democrats for an infrastructure bill that spent trillions more. This is why we have inflation. The country is now economically dislocated, and the Democrats' goal is to limit your choices like only getting gas on certain days, and controlling and lowering your electricity consumption. Biden, the Democrats, and the American Marxists are systemically dismantling the greatest economic engine this world has ever seen. The January 6 committee is a disgusting effort to criminalize a sitting president's right to challenge the results of an election until the electoral college votes are certified. The media suggests that former Attorney General Bill Barr will be the star witness in a criminal trial against former President Donald Trump. The Democrat Party doesn't fit into our system as a constitutional republic, it's an alien force in this country. Politicians and bureaucrats are seizing power and using the government's power to take control of private companies in the name of the Defense Production Act. Oil executives say that the U.S policy to decrease demand for fossil fuels will only ensure that no new refineries are ever built in the USA. This all but guarantees higher prices since domestic production has diminished.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
