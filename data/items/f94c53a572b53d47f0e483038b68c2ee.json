  "description": "<p>Credit cards can be a double-edged financial tool, and in this episode we cover how you can use them like a pro. Do you find yourself carrying a balance from one month to the next? Or are you tempted to overspend when you know you can just put it on credit? If so, then credit cards are NOT for you. For everyone else there are awesome benefits like earning cash back and scoring huge sign up bonuses, not to mention it's easier to track your expenses (which is an important step when creating a budget). Listen to the full episode to hear us weigh the pros and cons of using credit cards!</p><p>And at the beginning of this episode we popped open a bottle of Boulevard's Love Child No. 8, which you can find and learn all about on Untappd.
