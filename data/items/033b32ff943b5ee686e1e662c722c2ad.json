  "description": "This week, the gals get into the holiday spirit with some truly tragic tales of merriment gone awry. Topics include a violent mall Santa, a pair of greedy Grinches, and a man who just wanted to spread some cheer (and maybe some synthetic stimulants). Pour a hefty mug of Winc's Wonderful White Blend, secure your lawn ornaments, and tune in for Christmas Crimes.",
