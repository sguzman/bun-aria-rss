  "itunes:summary": "Today we celebrate the ‘central event in the history of the earth, the very thing the whole story has been about’ (C.S. Lewis). We celebrate the birth of Jesus. It is a day of great joy and celebration around the world.\nAnd yet, in the midst of all the trappings and celebrations of Christmas, it can be easy to miss why Jesus’ birth is so significant. The key to Christmas lies, not in the details of the shepherds’ visit or the wise men’s journey, but in the identity of the one whom they came to worship. In Jesus, God became ‘flesh’ and ‘made his dwelling among us’ (John 1:14). Christmas is about Jesus!\nOur New Testament passage for today helps us to grasp something of the magnitude of what that means. In it we are reminded that ‘baby Jesus’ is also the ‘Lord of lords and King of kings’ (Revelation 17:14b). We are given a glimpse of the cosmic struggle between good and evil, as a vast array of powers and authorities line up against God. Yet we are reminded that, in the end, it is through the humility and self-sacrifice of ‘the Lamb’ that they are overcome.\nJesus puts aside the glories of heaven for a humble stall. As the carol, Hark! The Herald Angels Sing, puts it:\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christ, by highest heaven adored;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Christ, the everlasting Lord;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;late in time behold him come,\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;offspring of a virgin&#039;s womb.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Veiled in flesh the Godhead see;\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;hail the incarnate Deity,\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;pleased as man with man to dwell,\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Jesus, our Emmanuel.\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Hark! The herald angels sing,\n&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;‘Glory to the new born King!’\nIn each of today’s passages we see the blessings of following this ‘new born King’.",
