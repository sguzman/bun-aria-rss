  "description": "<p>Edited audio from the livestream on July 27th 2019. Sean, Ash and Aziz discuss book and show Battle of the Blackwater (mostly book, Sean had just finished when we recorded). It's still the biggest battle in the books (6 POV chapters), and the first one HBO put on full display in Season 2 Episode 9. In the 2nd half, we chat Nashville/Con of Thrones 2019. We met Jerome Flynn (Bronn), Nikolaj Coster-Waldau (Jaime), the Wolf and the Crows and others while also hanging with fun people like Binge Mode and the elusive Alt Shift X. There were panels and cosplays galore, of course.
