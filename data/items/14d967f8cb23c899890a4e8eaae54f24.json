Elisa loved Martha Stewart and setting the family table, and went on to study fashion and event planning. It’s no surprise she channeled all her passions into <a href=\"https://www.mamannyc.com/\">maman</a>, the indie coffee shops in NYC and Toronto that are some of the prettiest and most pleasant around. She joins us to talk about her journey, her baked goods, and her plans for the future. In the second half of our show, Linda Thatch of the <a href=\"https://littleskips.nyc/\">Little Skips</a> coffee shops stops by to share how she went from so-so server to builder of a mini-empire in Bushwick, Brooklyn. We also talk sustainability in the coffee world. Linda’s mentee, Erika, joins us after Linda for a quick chat. It’s Erika’s first interview ever.
