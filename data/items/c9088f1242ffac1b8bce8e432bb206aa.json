This is mostly due to the uncertainty behind the Fed’s future interest rate hikes and Omicron. [0:25] I explain why this volatility will be the norm in 2022… and how investors can make a fortune by following one simple investment strategy. [2:28]  Turning to your questions… I highlight why gold will finally start to outperform the stock market… despite the Fed aggressively raising rates next year.
