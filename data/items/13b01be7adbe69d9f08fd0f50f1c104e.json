  "description": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This week, Zoraida Córdova (aka Zoey Castille) joins us to talk about fantasy romance and why it is so hard to find it in the romance pool. We talk about speculative fiction, high fantasy, low fantasy, urban fantasy, contemporary fantasy, paranormal romance and more, all while trying to figure out just what makes something fantasy and not paranormal (we think we’ve cracked the code). We also talk world building, about maps, and about merman junk.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Our next read along is Kylie Scott’s <em>Lead</em>, one of our longtime favorites.
