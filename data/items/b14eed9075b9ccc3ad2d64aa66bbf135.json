  "description": "<p>Scott Soshnick, Michael Barr and Eben Novy-Williams discuss a host of issues related to the business of sports, including a peek behind the curtain of what drives the venue business. The trio discuss the installation of a $4.6 million curtain at Minnesota's US Bank Stadium in time for college basketball's Final Four. As a condition of landing college basketball's marquee event the stadium agreed to darken its signature brightness. Why? Because the bid for the Final Four required a way to darken the venue and keep lighting consistent for televising the games. The money will come from the stadium's capital improvement fund. Also discussed is the leave of absence taken by San Francisco Giants CEO Larry Baer, who was captured on video having a physical altercation with his wife. Also talked about is the retirement of Big Ten Commissioner Jim Delaney and ESPN analyst Jessica Mendoza joining the New York Mets' front office. </p><p> </p><p>Hosts: Scott Soshnick, Michael Barr and Eben Novy-Williams</p><p>Producer: Madena Parwana</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
