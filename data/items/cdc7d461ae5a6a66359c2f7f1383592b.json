No matter how bad you think it is now, it will get worse later. In that spirit, we at the New Discourses Podcast present to you yet another \"academic\" paper rooted in Queer Theory: \"Cripping Incest Discourse(s)\" (https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s12119-021-09856-3). You probably didn't think it was an act of latent genocide to be against incestuous sexual relationships, but according to \"Crip Theory,\" which is the fusion of Queer Theory and Critical Disability Studies, you'd be wrong. You see, incest produces disabled and deformed offspring at a higher than otherwise rate, so you being against incest means you're supporting the idea that there should be fewer disabled people in the world, which is \"latent eugenics.\" Join host James Lindsay as he takes you through this stunning piece of academic work.
