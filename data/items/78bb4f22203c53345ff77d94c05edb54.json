  "description": "<p>We newly introduce the classic 2010 episode on Danto's \"The Philosophical Disenfranchisement of Art,\" \"The Appreciation and Interpretation of Works of Art,\" and \"The End of Art\" (1986).</p> <p>What effect should the avant garde have on our understanding of what art is? Danto gives a picture of philosophy and art at war throughout history: Philosophy says that art can't get at truth and is otherwise useless, yet philosophers like Plato seem afraid of the power of art to corrupt.
