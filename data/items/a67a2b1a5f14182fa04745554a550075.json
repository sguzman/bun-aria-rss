The first ranking they get to is who's the greatest running back ever, to which James and Reggie both say Barry Sanders (3:30). Tony Romo said the Packers are the team to beat in 2018 so the gang debates if this statement will hold up (9:45). The next list the guys get to is Win, Place, Show - best quarterbacks of the last quarter century (20:00).  Since Antonio Brown is having a Hall of Fame career, the last list Shek, James and Reggie create are their top five wide receivers of all-time (38:50).</p>\n      <p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
