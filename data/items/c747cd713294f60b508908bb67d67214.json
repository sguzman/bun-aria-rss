To aid in achieving this goal, there are several changes proposed to the European Union Emissions Trading System (EU ETS). </p>\n<p>In today’s episode of Switched On, we speak with Bo Qin and Emma Coker, who focus on carbon markets for BNEF. They outline these changes and their impact on the EU ETS. This episode was based on two BloombergNEF research notes: How ‘Fit for 55’ Would Reform the European Carbon Market, as well as Reforms and Offsets Front and Center for EU Carbon Players. These can be found at BNEF on the Bloomberg Terminal, at bnef.com, or on BNEF's mobile app. </p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
