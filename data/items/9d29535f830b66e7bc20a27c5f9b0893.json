  "title": "Super Bowl LV Recap: Bucs dismantle Chiefs with 31-9 victory, Tom Brady further cements legacy as the GOAT with another MVP and 7th title (Football 2/8)",
  "description": "Tom Brady has done the unthinkable. The GOAT switched organizations after two decades and managed to take his new team to the promised land in his first season, at age 43, during a pandemic. Yep, the Bucs are champions after a 31-9 victory over the Chiefs in Super Bowl LV, as Will Brinson, Ryan Wilson and John Breech are here to recap it all. And this wasn't just a win. It was a dismantling. Tampa controlled this game on both sides of the ball, disrupting Patrick Mahomes and the defending champs. Every time Kansas City mounted a minor comeback attempt, the Bucs thwarted those efforts. Rob Gronkowski came out of retirement to catch two touchdowns and Leonard Fournette emerged from Jacksonville to play a vital role in the title-clinching performance. The Pick Six Superfriends discuss Tampa Bay's dominating effort, questionable officiating calls, the MVP award, legacy and much more. Bruce Arians and his coaching staff deserve a ton of credit as do the players. Meanwhile, Andy Reid did not win off the bye, much to the dismay of the unofficial Pick Six jingle. The Chiefs' pass catchers were underwhelming, the offensive line was in shambles and the defense couldn't hold up. That's a recipe for disaster and that's what it turned into on Sunday. Tampa took advantage and are now Super Bowl LV winners.\n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nYou can listen to Pick Six on your smart speakers!
