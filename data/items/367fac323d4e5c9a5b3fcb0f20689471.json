  "description": "<p>IS HE DOWN?!?! Tom Segura knows he said \"okay\" to Charo, but that doesn't mean he accepted the bet, and Hot Ones's Sean Evans agrees with Enny: Hot sauce is the best! Tom and Tina weigh in on the Russia-Ukraine war, and watch a video of a Texan who has decided to join the Russian forces. Then, they take a look at a guy who browns his pants while driving, which leads to a conversation about F'ing when you need to brown. Also, we have another video of Luke Bryan hunting and it is just as good as the first one. The Main Mommies also discuss CP's favorite show \"Euphoria\" and the new Victoria's Secret model who has Down syndrome.</p>\n",
