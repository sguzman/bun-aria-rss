  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, the Obama-Biden administration is responsible for the biggest political scandal in American history. Newly filed court documents include FBI employees messaging one another admitting that \"Trump was right\" about being set up by rogue FBI leaders. They were also said to have a \"get-Trump\" attitude when investigating President Trump and advisors in his inner circle like Gen. Michael Flynn. Afterward, Sidney Powell, the attorney for Flynn, joins the show to discuss the latest court filing. Powell expects more documents to be declassified before the next oral argument over the government's and the defense's request to dismiss charges against Gen. Flynn.  Then, Joe Biden tells troops to \"clap you, stupid bastards\" at a 2016 speech at the al-dhafra airbase. Biden went on to insult the group further calling them a \"dull bunch\" and “slow.” Later, Trump has released a new Platinum plan to support African Americans including designating the KKK and ANTIFA as terrorist organizations. Finally, Madison Cawthorn calls in to talk about his congressional run in North Carolina’s 11th district.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
