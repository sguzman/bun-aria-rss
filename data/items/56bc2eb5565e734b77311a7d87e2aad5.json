  "description": "Kindness is the language the deaf can hear and the blind can see. In Episode 57 I sit down with Carly Taylor & James Aspey to talk about animal activism and talk about the importance of being patient, kind and understanding when communicating the 'vegan' message. For those of you who may be more interested in the health aspects of a plant-based lifestyle, or perhaps see 'vegan's as extreme, I urge you to listen to this conversation - I think it just may give you a different view of veganism.\n\nIN THIS EPISODE WE COVER:\n\nCarly's personal story - where she grew up, what life was like, why she transitioned to a plant based diet and why veganism is so important to her\n\nCarly's typical day on a plate\n\nSupplements Carly takes\n\nCarly's idea of Pre-Vegans\n\nStrategy for talking to others about the ethics of veganism\n\nHuman Rights, Mental Health, Animal Health/Rights and Planetary Health\n\nThe idea of 'humane' slaughter, organic, free-range, cage-free etc\n\nPackaging of animal products on shelf & marketing angles\n\nFuelling yourself on plants in 2019 - options for everyone (junk food versus whole food)\n\nImportance of the Lifestyle Medicine Doctor's encouraging plant based nutrition\n\nA plethora of resources to refer to for more information & inspiration\n\nPlans James & Carly have for 2019 and beyond\n\nand much much more during this 2.5 hour conversation\n\n\n*NOTE: although this podcast doesn't go into as much detail about factory farming as my previous podcast with James Aspey when he shared his story, there is still some talk about what happens to animals. So with that in mind, perhaps one parents want to listen to first before deciding if it's ok for their juniors to listen. I personally think there are so many powerful messages in this for our children to hear - whether via directly listening or being given a summary appropriate to their age and personality etc\n\nRESOURCES:\n\nFootage: \nwatch1000eyes.com\naussiefarms.org\nwatchdominion.com\nhttps://speciesismthemovie.com \n\nYoutube videos:\nJames’ speech: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=KHOcox2lvQo\nGary Yourofsky’s speech: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=es6U00LMmC4\nEarthling Ed’s speech: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z3u7hXpOm58\nErin Janus’ dairy video: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=UcN7SGGoCNI\nKid friendly videos (Bite Size Vegan): https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=GDEc87fomio&list=PLmIqdlomtuStMwQ9KWEE8Nn5GyK6vNqz2\n\nRecipes:\nBOSH: bosh.tv\nForks Over Knives: https://www.forksoverknives.com/recipes/\nLearn more about your ad choices.
