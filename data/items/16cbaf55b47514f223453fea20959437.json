  "description": "<p>CHAMPIONS AREN’T SUPER-HUMAN, THEY’RE SUPER-INTENTIONAL. I’ve noticed that there are two types of champions. One of them wins and says, “I am the greatest that ever lived.” The other says, “All of the glory goes to God.” Both of these mindsets have good results, but is one better than the other? You need a certain amount of arrogance to be the best. After all, self-doubt is the biggest crusher of dreams. But if you aren’t able to look at what you could be doing better, you’ll eventually decline. People won’t want to be around you. And you might destroy yourself in the process. So how can we lead with confidence and avoid getting a massive ego? On today’s episode of The School of Greatness, I talk about self-doubt and self-love with a sensitive, inspiring Formula One Champion: Nico Rosberg. Nico Rosberg followed in his father’s footsteps to win the Formula One World Championship in 2016. He grew up racing against Lewis Hamilton and constantly coming in second only to one day win the championship for himself. Nico shares how even though he was at the top of his field, he struggled with a fear of failure. In a field as macho as car racing, it’s inspiring to hear a man be so vulnerable. So get ready to learn how the tiny details matter when going for big wins on Episode 889.<br />\nSome Questions I Ask:<br />\nWhy isn’t Formula One as popular in the US?
