  "description": "<p>Get the Free Course here:<br /> <a href= \"https://phit.click/freecourse\">https://phit.click/freecourse</a></p> <p> </p> <p>I had a client ask me recently what to do when exercise feels hard. She wants to be an athlete, but she still has a lot of weight to lose. She works out then is laid up for days. She has the drive and the will, but her body is not quite ready to do what she really wants.</p> <p>This is how I started. I had always wanted to be an athlete. But at 250 pounds and first starting out, all I could do was a 10 minute walk. And that's okay.</p> <p>In this podcast I talk about meeting yourself where you are and leveling up a little at a time. That's exactly what I did. I went from walking 10 minutes at a time to running marathons and power lifting. You can too.</p> <p> </p>",
