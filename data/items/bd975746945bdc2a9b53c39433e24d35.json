  "description": "Against a challenging backdrop of sky-high inflation, rising rates and growing recession concerns, the S&P 500 has had an undeniably grim start to the year, with the tech-heavy Nasdaq and unprofitable growth companies performing even more dismally. In the latest episode of Exchanges at Goldman Sachs, host Allison Nathan turns to three equity market heavyweights — Cathie Wood, Founder, CEO, and CIO of ARK Invest; Cliff Asness, Founder and CIO of AQR Capital Management; and David Kostin, GS Chief U.S. Equity Strategist — for their thoughts on where equities are heading from here and what that means for investors. This episode is based on Allison Nathan's Top of Mind report.",
