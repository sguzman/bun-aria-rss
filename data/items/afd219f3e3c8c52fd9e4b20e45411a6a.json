  "description": "We all have some codependency issues right….? Or is that just a Sofia thing? \n\nThis week Sofia is joined by the one and only, the man we all know and love - John Azemar! Today the two meet up for a quick little catch up beginning with Sofia’s mom's recent ayahuasca trip that she may or may not have found off of an Instagram ad. We’re not sure. Next, John tells us about his impending surgery from a stingray incident that happened a few years ago - and for some reason John being stung by a stingray is zero percent shocking. Finally, we have a very confronting Sloot University where John takes the professor role today, and Sofia is the sloodent. John wastes NO time digging into Sofia’s avoidant tendencies and codependency struggles - and probably says some things we ALL have been wanting to say to her. Not that it’s gonna matter anyway because as you’re listening to this Sofia is on a romantic getaway in Italy so per usual, in one ear and out the other! \n\nFollow Sofia on Instagram and Twitter @SofiaFranklyn\nFind merch HERE: https://sofiafranklyn.com/ \n\nDipsea: http://www.dipseastories.com/SOFIA for 30 days full access\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
