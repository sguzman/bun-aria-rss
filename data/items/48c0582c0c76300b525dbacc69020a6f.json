  "description": "<p>Why aren't there more details in Bible stories? Many of us have wondered something like this and sometimes walk away from the Bible confused.  We don't know why a character did what they did, or what they looked like, or even what the \"moral of the story\" is.</p>\n<p>And this is frustrating to modern readers because we like lots of detail.  We want to know everything about a character and the setting and the story background.</p>\n<p>This week Tim and Jon take a look at why so many of the stories in the Bible are perplexing.  It's because they were intentionally designed that way, in an ancient style of writing known as Jewish Meditation Literature.</p>\n<p>Using the story of Cain and Able, the guys ask why are so many of the details in the story left out?
