  "description": "<p>While the 1960s shift in print and TV advertising has been heavily documented and mythologized by Mad Men, Madison Avenue’s radiophonic collision with the counterculture is less well known. A radio advertising producer, writer, and composer, Clive Desmond takes listeners on a highly subjective journey through one narrow, eccentric, corridor of radio advertising. Here, he has rescued beautiful forgotten nuggets of radio history and delicately arranged them into a glittering associative chain—a constellation of jingles and spots that somehow all add up to more. A version of episode was originally featured on <a href=\"https://www.kcrw.com/news-culture/shows/the-organist/\" target=\"_blank\">The Organist</a>, a bi-weekly experimental arts-and-culture program from McSweeney's and KCRW.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://99percentinvisible.org/?p=22679&post_type=episode\" target=\"_blank\">A 700-Foot Mountain of Whipped Cream</a></p>\n",
