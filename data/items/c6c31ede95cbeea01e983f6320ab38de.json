  "description": "Mick’s back at Beechwood and has noticed a slight problem with the hot tub. Mortified Lee explains Jack and Henry’s trick with the bubbles. He feels responsible and wants to fix it. Mick suggests they look at it together. When they do, Mick ends up doing the work, with Lee providing the bag of tools. Joy reckons it’s fine, Mick’s good at this sort of thing and enjoys it. Lee detects Joy’s a bit subdued. She confides that Mick’s told her he loves her. She doesn’t know what to do about it. It’s very quick; she’s not sure she can say it back. And what if he doesn’t mean it? She confesses she hasn’t told Rochelle about Mick for fear of being judged. Lee suggests Joy doesn’t need to reciprocate with Mick if she’s not ready. Later Joy tells Mick they should take their time; there’s no rush.\nGeorge expresses his gratitude to Brad for doing his essay for him. They spot Tilly Button, and Brad disapproves of George’s comments, feeling he’s disrespectful. George scoffs. Brad needs to get some notches on his belt. He suggests Mia’s into Brad and might be worth an approach. He continues to badger until reluctant Brad agrees. His attempt goes wrong and he ends up friend zoning himself to a bewildered Mia. Later George crows to Mia that he made Brad ask her out. Mia thinks it was a horrible, unkind thing to do. She reckons there’s something wrong with George – he needs to go home and stay out of her sight.",
