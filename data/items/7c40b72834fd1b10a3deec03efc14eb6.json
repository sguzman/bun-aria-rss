  "description": "<p>May 2009. Cleveland, Tennessee. In late 2009, Kelly DeLude, a hairdresser, noticed that it had been a while since Marsha Brantley, one of her regular clients, had come in. Donnie, Marsha’s husband, said she had left him and he hadn’t seen her since May or June 2009. It seemed that Marsha had simply vanished. However, as time went on, investigators noticed that Donnie kept changing his story. With few clues, no apparent motive for foul play, and a non-cooperative husband the case became very frustrating very quickly. Where is Marsha Brantley? And did her husband have anything to do with her disappearance?</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
