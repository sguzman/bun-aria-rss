  "description": "Our guest this week is Alicia Menendez, an award-winning journalist, who finds herself in a common position for many women: caring way too much about what others think of her.  Be nice, but not too nice. Be successful, but not too successful. Just be likeable, whatever that means. In the workplace strong women are often criticized for being cold, while warm women may be seen as pushovers. In her just released book, The Likeability Trap, and in our conversation, she discusses this issue and explains how and why both men and women should combat it.\nPlug Zone\nThe Likeability Trap: https://www.amazon.com/Likeability-Trap-Break-Free-Worth/dp/0062838768\nWebsite: http://aliciamenendez.com/\nTwitter: @AliciaMenendez\nInstagram: @aliciamenendezxo\nFacebook: @AliciaMenendezTV\nAn Evening with Joseph Goldstein and Dan Harris: Staying Sane in a Crazy World\nhttps://www.nyimc.org/event/an-evening-with-joseph-goldstein-and-dan-harris-staying-sane-in-a-crazy-world/\nEpisode References\nPsychological Safety / What Google Learned From Its Quest to Build the Perfect Team:\nhttps://www.nytimes.com/2016/02/28/magazine/what-google-learned-from-its-quest-to-build-the-perfect-team.html\nTHE FIVE INVITATIONS: Discovering What Death Can Teach Us About Living Fully\nhttps://fiveinvitations.com/the-book/\nWeCroak: https://www.wecroak.com/\nTen Percent Happier Podcast Insiders Feedback Group: https://10percenthappier.typeform.com/to/vHz4q4\nHave a question for Dan?
