  "description": "Biden brags about maintaining 8.5% inflation. He throws around the term \"zero\" a lot in comparison to last month: Does he believe what he's saying, or does he just read it off the teleprompter? Ilhan Omar almost loses. Dems trailing in House races in liberal strongholds, like Oregon. Regime won't comment on Stasi-like raid on rival Trump. Best movie trilogies.  FBI agents seize GOP Congressman Scott Perry's phone, reminds Clay of Order 66 from Star Wars. Leftist totalitarians redefine words. Look at what the corrupt FBI did to General Flynn, they can't be trusted. \"They are untrustworthy -- period,\" Clay says. Buck says, \"the answer is no,\" if the FBI knocks at his door wanting a little information about someone he might know. Both C&B say they would direct the FBI to their lawyers, and also suggest that for all of us.<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
