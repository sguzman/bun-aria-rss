  "description": "<p>How do you train your attention and stop your mind from wandering in only twelve minutes a day?</p> <p>Maintaining your attention and focus in a world filled with distractions can be very difficult. The constant disruption of notifications can start to feel like you don’t have ownership over your own mind. But solutions like avoiding technology for periods of time rely on external intervention rather than giving you control over your ability to concentrate.</p> <p>To go in-depth on this topic, I’m thrilled to have Dr. Amishi Jha on the show today. Dr. Jha is a neuroscientist and professor of psychology at the University of Miami. She’s also the author of the bestselling book, <em data-stringify-type=\"italic\">Peak Mind: Find Your Focus, Own Your Attention, Invest 12 Minutes a Day</em>. Packed with over fifteen years of research, her book gives you practical steps on how to use mindfulness training to regain your ability to be present in any situation—in only twelve minutes a day.</p> <p>Technology is a necessity in the modern world. Instead of removing access to digital devices, you can train your attention to be distraction-proof. Listen in, as Dr. Jha gives you actionable steps to start training your focus, notice where your attention is at any given time, and learn how to redirect to get back on track.</p> <p>*** Do you want to stay up to date with every new episode and get my brand new Kwik Brain Accelerator Program?
