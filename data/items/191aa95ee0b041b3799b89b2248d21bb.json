  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, Sens. Kamala Harris and Elizabeth Warren are supporting reparations. Since history reveals that the Democrat Party has historically opposed abolitionists, and civil rights leaders, it is the Democrat Party that ought to pay reparations to the distant relatives of former slaves. Being that the Ku Klux Klan was an outgrowth of the Democratic Party, and being that this party supported slavery and the confederate south in the civil war and it was this party that supported Jim Crow laws and segregation. After, the Green New Deal is pushed out by Democrats and quacks in the media that support the confiscation of your hard earned dollars. This a full scale attack on capitalism hiding behind concocted terms like \"over-industrialized\" and \"de-growthing\" but it’s nothing more than the old red communist movement now draped in \"green.\" The left has gone from shouting that \"the government has to stay out of the bedroom\" to requiring the government to be involved in every single aspect of our lives. This is the iron fist of communism rearing through our republic and it’s being led by \"old red's\" like Sen Bernie Sanders and new green ones like Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez. Then, kudos to President Trump for bringing the fight to the media, when they take shots at him he takes shots right back—good for him! Finally, a Judge ruled that a men-only military draft is unconstitutional. These judges are becoming more and more like activists. No, women should not be in any combat roles.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
