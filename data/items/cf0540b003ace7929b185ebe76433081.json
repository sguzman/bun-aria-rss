  "description": "<p>Would you ever pick up the habit of smoking in order to lose some weight? After all it <em>is</em> effective- by lowering your metabolic rate and reducing your appetite you’re bound to shed a few pounds. It sounds like a quick fix worth considering, but ultimately we hope that this isn’t something that you would do because everyone is well aware of the longer-term health consequences of smoking. The downsides are too severe. But we think this is exactly what is happening when you prioritize getting rich over building wealth. Sure there will be some short-term goals and lifestyle improvements that you’ll be able to make, but the long-term effects of pursuing a lifestyle like this are ultimately going to undermine your financial foundation. Listen as we talk about the differences between getting rich and building wealth. We also highlight some unhealthy behaviors that we might be tempted towards, in the pursuit of riches. And then finally we discuss how it is that we can actually build our own wealth.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Tropicalia by Creature Comforts!
