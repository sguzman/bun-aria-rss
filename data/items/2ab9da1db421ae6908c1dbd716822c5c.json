  "description": "Baton Rouge Serial Killer. Baton Rouge, Louisiana. From 1998 to 2003, a serial killer was following, stalking, and violently murdering women. There was never any visible forced entry to the victims' homes and, for quite some time, law enforcement was sure that a white male in a white pickup was their suspect. The brazen killer would eventually be discovered and once his past was exposed, a clear picture of who he was and how he operated became chillingly clear.
