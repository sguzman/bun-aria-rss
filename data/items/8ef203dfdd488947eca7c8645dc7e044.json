  "description": "<p>Bravo shocked the world when they announced there'd be no reunion for season 13 of <strong>The Real Housewives of New York</strong>. The network blamed this on scheduling conflicts, but we sniffed around and discovered a massive coverup. Turns out the cast did actually come together to tape the reunion, but the results were so vile and embarrassing that the network shelved the episode. Luckily, we managed to get our hands on the only surviving audio; so we present it to you here EXCLUSIVELY and uncensored. Listen and enjoy.</p>\n",
