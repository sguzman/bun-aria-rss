    "media:description": "Improve your Spanish listening comprehension and speaking while learning vocabulary related to activities in nature and how to care for the environment. \n\nThrough storytelling, as well as \"storyasking,\" you will have moments to practice speaking Spanish and responding to questions in the target language as we explore some of the common vocabulary related to enjoying nature and caring for the planet. \n\nComprehensible Input (staying in the target language using language that is comprehensible) has been proven to be an effective and engaging way to learn a new language. If you enjoy this approach to language acquisition, subscribe to my channel for more Comprehensible Input and TPRS videos to come!",
