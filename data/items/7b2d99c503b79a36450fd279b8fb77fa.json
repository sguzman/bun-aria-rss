    "media:description": "It's time to design some trials. Sometimes engineers need to figure out how to test ideas. In order to do that, we need to design trials to find failure points and see how things are going to work in the real world (with gravity, wind, and human error all factored in). In this episode of Crash Course Kids, Sabrina takes us to the fair to help us design a trial.\n\n///Standards Used in This Video///\n3-5-ETS1-2. Generate and compare multiple possible solutions to a problem based on how well each is likely to meet the criteria and constraints of the problem.\n\nWant to find Crash Course elsewhere on the internet?\nCrash Course Main Channel: https://www.youtube.com/crashcourse\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/YouTubeCrashCourse\nTwitter - http://www.twitter.com/thecrashcourse\nTumblr - http://thecrashcourse.tumblr.com\n\nCredits...\nProducer & Editor: Nicholas Jenkins\nCinematographer & Director: Michael Aranda\nHost: Sabrina Cruz\nScript Supervisor: Mickie Halpern\nWriter: Jen Szymanski\nExecutive Producers: John & Hank Green\nConsultant: Shelby Alinsky\nScript Editor: Blake de Pastino\n\nThought Cafe Team:\nStephanie Bailis\nCody Brown\nSuzanna Brusikiewicz\nJonathan Corbiere\nNick Counter\nKelsey Heinrichs\nJack Kenedy\nCorey MacDonald\nTyler Sammy\nNikkie Stinchcombe \nJames Tuer\nAdam Winnik",
