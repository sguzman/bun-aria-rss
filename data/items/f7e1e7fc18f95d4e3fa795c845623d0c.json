  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sami Lane (AKA Freak Daddy) is a TikTok star, musician, producer, and badass individual. They built a Freak Daddy cult on social media to give people a safe space to be curious instead of confused about whatever is happening in their life. They join the show this week to talk about their music and upcoming album, and to share the funniest Tinder story that made them a viral sensation on TikTok. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Takeaways:</strong></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Sami is non-binary and doesn’t associate with either gender, although they are exploring their trans masculinity.
