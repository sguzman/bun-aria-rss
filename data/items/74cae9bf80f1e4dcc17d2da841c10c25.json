  "description": "<p>We study the relation between the Galois group $G$ of a linear\ndifference-differential system and two classes $\\mathcal{C}_1$ and\n$\\mathcal{C}_2$ of groups that are the Galois groups of the specializations of\nthe linear difference equation and the linear differential equation in this\nsystem respectively. We show that almost all groups in $\\mathcal{C}_1\\cup\n\\mathcal{C}_2$ are algebraic subgroups of $G$, and there is a nonempty subset\nof $\\mathcal{C}_1$ and a nonempty subset of $\\mathcal{C}_2$ such that $G$ is\nthe product of any pair of groups from these two subsets. These results have\npotential application to the computation of the Galois group of a linear\ndifference-differential system. We also give a criterion for testing linear\ndependence of elements in a simple difference-differential ring, which\ngeneralizes Kolchin's criterion for partial differential fields.\n</p>",
