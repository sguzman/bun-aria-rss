  "content:encoded": "<p>To celebrate the 20th anniversary of Insomniac&#8217;s Ratchet & Clank franchise, Sony <a href=\"https://blog.playstation.com/2022/11/04/celebrating-20-years-of-ratchet-clank/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">announced</a> that it is adding five new games from its PlayStation 3 era to the PlayStation Plus Premium subscription service on November 15.</p>\n<p>A few Ratchet & Clank games were already available on Sony&#8217;s revamped PS Plus service, but the update expands that list out significantly. Here&#8217;s the full list of games coming to the service.</p>\n<ul>\n<li><em>Ratchet & Clank </em>(PS3)</li>\n<li><em>Ratchet & Clank: Going Commando</em></li>\n<li><em>Ratchet & Clank: Up Your Arsenal</em></li>\n<li><em>Ratchet & Clank: Deadlocked</em></li>\n<li><em>Ratchet & Clank Future: Tools of Destruction</em></li>\n</ul>\n<p>It&#8217;s worth noting that PlayStation 3 games can only be <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/best-games-on-playstation-plus-ps-extra-premium/\">streamed from the PlayStation Plus Premium</a> service, not downloaded directly like how Xbox Game Pass games can operate.</p>\n<p>Additionally, the PlayStation 5 game <em>Ratchet & Clank: Rift Apart</em> will receive a free 20th-anniversary armor pack today. It contains five armors that are inspired by different games in the franchise. The Commando Armor is inspired by <em>Going Commando</em>, Holoflux Armor inspired by <em>Ratchet & Clank Future: A Crack in Time</em>, Quest Armor inspired by <em>Ratchet & Clank: Quest for Booty</em>, Marauder Armor inspired by <em>Deadlocked</em>, and a Clank armor inspired by Ratchet&#8217;s robot companion.</p>\n<blockquote class=\"h-lazy-embed\" data-width=\"500\" data-dnt=\"true\" data-initial-classes=\"twitter-tweet\" data-embed-name=\"twitter\" data-sdk-src=\"//platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\">\n<p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">Today, we&rsquo;re celebrating 20 years of travel across space, time and dimensions with Ratchet &amp; Clank!</p>\n<p>Details on the anniversary Armor Pack for Rift Apart, and classic games from the series coming to PlayStation Plus Premium: <a href=\"https://t.co/1BVEaFbdk5\">https://t.co/1BVEaFbdk5</a> <a href=\"https://t.co/cMCQRGsWmk\">pic.twitter.com/cMCQRGsWmk</a></p>\n<p>&mdash; PlayStation (@PlayStation) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/PlayStation/status/1588546848976797697?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 4, 2022</a></p></blockquote>\n<p>The first <em>Ratchet & Clank</em> game launched in 2002 for the PlayStation 2 when Insomniac was still an independent developer. The studio is best known for working on the Ratchet & Clank and Spyro franchises. It also developed the PlayStation-exclusive first-person shooter series, Resistance. Insomniac created one Microsoft exclusive, <em>Sunset Overdrive</em>, for Xbox One and PC. Nowadays, Insomniac is most well-known for <em>Marvel&#8217;s Spider-Man</em> and <em>Marvel&#8217;s Spider-Man: Miles Morales</em> for PS4 and PS5.</p>\n<p>Currently, Insomniac is working on <em>Marvel&#8217;s Spider-Man 2</em> and a <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/marvels-wolverine-release-date-trailer-gameplay-news/\">new <em>Wolverine</em> game</a>. The former is slated to release <a href=\"https://www.digitaltrends.com/gaming/spider-man-2-reveal/\">sometime in 2023</a> while the latter hasn&#8217;t received a definitive release window yet.</p>\n",
