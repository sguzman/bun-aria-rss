Is our stream of consciousness unified?</p> <p class=\"\">The hardest problem of all, might be the origin of consciousness itself: how, why, or <em>are we,</em> subjects of experience? In one sense, it shouldn’t come as a surprise - after all, in the words of physicist <a href=\"https://mkaku.org/\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Michio Kaku</a>, ‘Sitting on your shoulders is the most complicated object in the known universe; 100 billion neurons, each connected to 10,000 others’.
