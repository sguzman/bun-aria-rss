  "description": "This episode originally aired on 8/6/21\nSlowly, thanks to Congressional information requests and court cases, hard evidence is emerging about the way the former president and those close to him worked to steal the last election.

We discuss with Ryan Goodman of \"Just Security\" and NYU Law School, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University Law School and Dr. Kavita Patel of the Brookings Institution. It's a pretty tough discussion to hear...but you need to hear it.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
