  "description": "<p>Think back to when you were a kid- can you remember an instance where you asked your parents a question, and instead of explaining the actual answer, they just said &ldquo;Because I said so&rdquo;. How frustrating! Or maybe in middle school you were horrified to even be seen with your folks in public because of something they were wearing. You&rsquo;d say to yourself &ldquo;I&rsquo;m never going to be like parents!&rdquo;. Well that was us to a T, and we always thought we&rsquo;d be intown city dwellers. Well times have changed and so we&rsquo;ll share why it is that we&rsquo;re moving (yes&hellip; both of our families!), but we realized this is also an incredibly relevant topic for a lot of folks out there. Of course housing is everyone&rsquo;s top expense, but there are many reasons why moving is top of mind for a large percentage of Americans. Listen as we discuss a healthy framework and factors to consider when you&rsquo;re debating a move. Not only financial considerations like cost of living and increasing your earning potential, but also lifestyle considerations like relationships and schools. And we&rsquo;ll also leave you with a few tips to help ensure you&rsquo;re making this move without breaking the bank.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During this episode we enjoyed a Stuckey&rsquo;s Pecan Log Roll by Wild Heaven!
