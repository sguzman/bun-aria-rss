    "media:description": "Boolean logic is an important part of computer science, both at the hardware level and the software level. Can we do boolean logic in HoTT? Of course we can! This video shows how to recreate the logic of boolean circuits and logic gates, both in informal HoTT and in our Agda formalization of HoTT.\n\nVideo site for the series: https://intro-hott.video\nYoutube: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL245PKGUDdcN9-El9D7DRefwX4c9feiYq\nInstagram: @Intro_HoTT\nTwitter: @Intro_HoTT\n\nFormalization links:\n- Appeared in this video: https://github.com/jacobneu/HoTT-agda/blob/main/01-simpleTT.agda\n- The formalization I'm developing for this video series: https://github.com/jacobneu/HoTT-agda\n- The formalization it's based on (by Egbert Rijke, for his upcoming textbook): https://github.com/HoTT-Intro/Agda\n- More up-to-date HoTT formalization in Agda: https://github.com/UniMath/agda-unimath\n\nHoTT textbooks:\n- The HoTT Book (2013) -- the original statement of HoTT: https://homotopytypetheory.org/book/\n- Introduction to Homotopy Type Theory, by Egbert Rijke (to be released): https://ncatlab.org/nlab/show/Introduction+to+Homotopy+Type+Theory\n\n\nImage/audio credits:\n- https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:ClaudeShannon_MFO3807.jpg (CC-BY-SA 2.0 - De)\n- https://www.cs.virginia.edu/~evans/greatworks/shannon38.pdf \n- https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:Panel_Office_Typical_OGT-colourbalance-2.jpg\n- https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:PCB_Spectrum.jpg (CC-BY-SA 3.0)\n- https://commons.wikimedia.org/wiki/File:George_Boole_color.jpg\n- \"Wholesome\" by Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com); CC BY 4.0 (https://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)\n\n\n\nHomotopy type theory (HoTT) is a new branch of type theory and a new foundation for mathematics. It serves as a common language for reasoning about computation (functional programming), about mathematical structure (synthetic homotopy theory and higher category theory), and about constructive logic. This Introduction to Homotopy Type Theory video lecture series is intended to explain what HoTT is, show how to work in HoTT (including how formalization in Agda works), and give intuition for why HoTT is the way it is. I don’t assume any particular background familiarity, but the more you know about mathematics, computer science, and logic, the more you’ll be able to get out of these videos. Enjoy!",
