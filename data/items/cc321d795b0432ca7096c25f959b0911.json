  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys react to the news that Cam Newton has been released by the Patriots and Mac Jones will be the starting quarterback, and all the other cuts that have been made as NFL teams have to get their rosters down to 53 guys. Joining the program to chat about the Mac Jones/Cam Newton situation and why the decision was made to go with Mac Jones is 2x Super Bowl Champion, former GM of the Cleveland Browns, Special Assistant for the Coaching staff for the Patriots, The Daily Coach, and host of the Lombardi Line and GM Shuffle Podcast, friend of the program, Michael Lombardi (9:20-31:47). Next, Super Bowl Champion, 6x Pro Bowler, 5x All-Pro, member of the 2010's All-Decade, #5 on the 2021 NFL Top 100, and friend of the program, Travis Kelce joins Pat and AJ Hawk to chat about this upcoming season, having a bad taste in his mouth from last year's Super Bowl, why Patrick Mahomes is so special, his thoughts on the Top 100, and his time being a reality TV star (33:51-48:40). Later, Pat and AJ chat about the different cuts around the league, Mac Jones being the starter in New England, and all the things we need to be looking for as we approach the start of the NFL season (50:06-1:12:55). To close out the show, Pat and AJ are joined by Super Bowl Champion, 14 year NFL veteran at QB, and current Head Coach of Lipscomb Academy, Trent Dilfer. Pat, AJ, and Trent chat about the video of him going viral after his altercation with one of his players on the sideline (who he's known since the players birth), what he would've done differently, and his thoughts on everything going on in the NFL right now as cut down day is here (1:12:55-1:41:11).
