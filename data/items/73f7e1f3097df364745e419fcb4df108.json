I often say, ‘fashion is what I do, it's not who I am.’”</li> <li style=\"font-weight:400;\">The pressures on designers have become even more intense with the rise of social media. That’s more true than ever in an era where the pandemic has at times made digital the only available avenue of communication. Constantly being exposed to the feedback and opinions of others can feel debilitating Cole said.  “Unfortunately our industry embraces it and rewards it… and the more likes you have and the bigger audience you have, the more access you will often have.” </li> <li style=\"font-weight:400;\">What’s next is changing the way people speak about mental health so it there’s less stigma attached to it. The best way to do that “be supportive and non-judgemental and listen,” Cole said. “We all have different degrees and we have ups and we have downs. And we have periods where we’re feeling more in control than other [times]... [but] having a conversation is a big first step.” </li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>Related Articles:</p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/intelligence/inside-fashions-enduring-mental-health-epidemic'> Inside Fashion’s Enduring Mental Health Epidemic</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/education/stressed-and-depressed-a-mental-health-guide-for-fashion-students'> Stressed and Depressed: A Mental Health Guide for Fashion Students</a></p> <p><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/opinion/op-ed-fashions-fake-it-til-you-make-it-problem'> Op-Ed | The Perils of Fashion's 'Fake-It-Til-You-Make-It' Culture</a></p> <p> </p> <p><em>Watch and listen to more #BoFLIVE conversations </em><em><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/articles/tags/topics/bof-live'>here</a>.</em><em> To contact </em><em><a href= 'https://www.businessoffashion.com/organisations/the-business-of-fashion'>The Business of Fashion</a></em><em> with comments, questions, or speaker ideas please </em><em><a href= 'mailto:podcast@businessoffashion.com'>e-mail podcast@businessoffashion.com</a></em><em>.</em></p> <p>Sign up for BoF’s <a href='http://bit.ly/BoFnews'>Daily Digest newsletter</a>.</p> <p>Ready to become a BoF Professional?
