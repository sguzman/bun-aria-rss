  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, This isn't a caravan of immigrants, it’s an invasion! The media and its appendage, the Democratic Party, are framing the narrative claiming that President Trump is driving a message of fear and lies about these foreigners marching from central America to America. In fact, some \"reporters\" went as far as keeping the story solely on Trump and their propaganda about \"fear-mongering\" clearly turning a blind eye to the impending invasion of thousands of people at our southern border. While the media blames Trump for scaring people, the real fear lies with MS-13 which is a genuine threat to urban communities across America. Then, we listen to former presidents Clinton and Obama’s tough rhetoric on illegal immigration plus a classic commentary from the late Congresswoman Barbara Jordan. Also, Democrats want to change the citizenry because that’s the way to change the electorate. If you oppose this destruction of our country, our system of commerce, or our system of healthcare you'll be labeled a racist, xenophobe or misogynist. They will not debate the issues because their ideology is illegitimate and they know it! Finally, Congressman Dave Brat calls in to discuss his campaign for re-election in Virginia’s 7th Congressional district.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
