  "description": "<p>Scott Soshnick, Eben Novy-Williams and Michael Barr discuss a host of issues related to the business of sports, including an economist's examination into what certain student-athletes should have been paid while still in school. It was estimated that New Orleans Pelicans standout and former Duke basketball player Zion Williamson, for instance, would've made more than $5 million while with the Blue Devils. The study was done by David Berri, a sports economist and professor of economics at Southern Utah University. Also discussed are sagging National Basketball Association ratings this season, particularly those on national telecasts, and a plan being considered by the New York Times to offer its sports section as a standalone digital subscription. In addition, Barr has a discussion with auto racing legend Roger Penske, who recently reached agreement with Hulman & Co. to purchase the Indianapolis Motor Speedway and the IndyCar Series.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
