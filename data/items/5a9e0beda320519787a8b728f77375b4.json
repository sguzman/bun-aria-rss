  "title": "War Of The Roses: She's Afraid Her Husband Is Making The Same Mistake She Made In The Past",
  "description": "We used to do a bit called “War of the Roses” back in the day where we’d pretend to be a florist, call a guy who was allegedly cheating, tell him he won a free bouquet of roses, and ask him who he wants to send them to. If he picked his wife, yay!…but if he picked some other girl to send the flowers to…well then, there’s your cheating proof.\nWe loved doing it, BUT…we had to stop doing it because of new laws and a bunch of other technicalities around recording people, etc., whatever, but we found a loophole: E-MAIL.\nYears ago, she cheated on her husband. It was a rough time for them, but they agree to work through their issues. Afterward, she noticed a change in her husband. He started working out more and getting more attention from women. Now she's afraid he's cheating on her. Is she right? We'll find out.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
