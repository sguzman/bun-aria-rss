  "description": "Firearm-related injuries are among the 5 leading causes of death for people ages 1-64 in the United States, <a href=\"https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/firearms/fastfact.html\">according to the CDC</a>. In 2019, there were 39,707 firearm-related deaths in the United States. That's an average of 109 deaths per day. Firearm-related injuries are harder to quantify, but the <a href=\"https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/past-tolls\">Gun Violence Archive</a> reports that there were over 40,000 last year. <br/><br/>CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky has called gun violence a \"<a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/27/health/cdc-gun-research-walensky/index.html\">serious public health threat</a>.\" She's the first CDC Director to make strong public statements about gun violence since 1999. For decades, gun violence research received no federal funding. That's in large part because of <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/2018/04/05/599773911/how-the-nra-worked-to-stifle-gun-violence-research\">pressure from the NRA</a>. <br/><br/>Once again, the United States is investing in a public health approach to stemming gun violence. <a href=\"http://leighbureau.com/speakers/mrosenberg\">Dr. Mark Rosenberg</a>, founding director of CDC's National Center for Injury Prevention and Control, explains what this means. <br/><br/>Additional reporting in this episode from NPR's <a href=\"https://www.npr.org/people/2101350/eric-westervelt\">Eric Westervelt</a>.<br/><br/><a href=\"https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this\">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href=\"mailto:considerthis@npr.org\">considerthis@npr.org</a>.
