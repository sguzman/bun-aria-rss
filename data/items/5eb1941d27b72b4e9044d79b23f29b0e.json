  "description": "In today's podcast we learn that the US Intelligence Community discovered the DNC hack sometime last year—much earlier than its public disclosure this Spring. We hear about threats to critical infrastructure, and we follow developments in the cyber criminal markets—ransomware's getting mighty picky, if you ask us. We hear about ISIS's appeal to disaffected petty criminals. The Olympics see both cybercrime and patriotic hacktivism. Quintessence Labs' John Leiseboer discusses redundancy and replication of data, and we interview Robert M. Lee from Dragos Security about ICS SCADA security, and preparing for cyber security jobs. And, of course, we hear more about how Pokémon-GO is driving security people quite nuts.",
