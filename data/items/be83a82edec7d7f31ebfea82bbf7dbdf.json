  "description": "<p>Patrick writes \"It was October 13th 2016. I was bow hunting in my deer blind outside of St Clair Missouri just off the meramec river. Times were tough.</p> <p>I had just gotten laid off and my older sister who's land I was hunting on had just lost her job and her husband was disabled so there was little money. I was hunting for food to feed us. I had been scouting for several weeks and had been seeing deer every day. For about a week prior to the 13th I had noticed the deer had seemed to disappear. I thought that they had gone into an early rut and the bucks were chasing the does at night and running them ragged.</p> <p>Check out the full encounter at <a href= \"https://sasquatchchronicles.com/sc-ep724-the-sounds-they-make/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">https://sasquatchchronicles.com/sc-ep724-the-sounds-they-make/</a></p>",
