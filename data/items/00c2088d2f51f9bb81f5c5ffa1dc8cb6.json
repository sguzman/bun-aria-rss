  "description": "<p>When you think of your assets, you probably think of your money. But you also have three other hugely important assets at your disposal too: your time, energy, and priorities. When you manage these assets poorly, you can feel overwhelmed and scattered and yet unproductive and unfulfilled. When you manage them well, things in your personal and professional life click, and you experience traction and satisfaction.</p>\n<p>How do you avoid the first situation and achieve the second? My guest today, Carey Nieuwhof, provides answers in his book <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3ALRPh5\"><em>At Your Best: How to Get Time, Priorities, and Energy Working in Your Favor</em></a>. We begin our conversation with Carey's story of achieving success, only to suffer burnout, and how burnout has become less of a job problem these days than a general life problem. We then talk about how to leave what Carey calls the \"stress spiral\" and get into the \"thrive cycle.\" We discuss the two mental shifts you need to make to better manage your time, how to keep other people (and yourself) from hijacking your priorities, the power of categorical decision-making in separating the good from the best, and why you need to put even your personal commitments on your calendar. We also talk about scheduling your daily tasks into what Carey calls your green, yellow, and red energy zones, and how to spend your time more strategically.</p>\n",
