  "description": "<p>April 4th, 1994. Farmington, New Mexico. On the morning of April 4, 1994, Paul Dunn called 911 claiming that his wife had been shot. When police arrived, Paul was performing CPR on his wife, Monica, in the open garage. He was also covered in blood. She was rushed to the hospital where she was pronounced dead on arrival. She had died from a gunshot wound to her abdomen. She and her husband, Paul, had separated after she discovered he was having an affair. He claimed that she died by suicide. The local police, for whom Paul worked, thought that he killed her after an argument at home. What led to the shooting? Did Paul murder his wife with his shotgun? Or did Monica shoot herself? There is more to this case than you might think.</p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
