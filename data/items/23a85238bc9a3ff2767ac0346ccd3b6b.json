Less than one hour ago, after days spent slogging across Antarctic desert in -30 celsius temperatures, 30-year old pro triathlete turned mountaineering adventure athlete Colin O'Brady reached the South Pole — the first stop on his world record quest to become the youngest and fastest human to ever complete the&nbsp;Explorers Grand Slam —&nbsp;an adventurers challenge to summit the highest mountain on each of the seven continents as well as trek to both the North and South Poles.</p><p>Only 44 people in documented history have successfully completed the challenge. Of these, only 2 have done it under a year.</p><p>Colin's goal? Get it done in five months.</p><p>If that's not amazing enough, consider that just eight years ago, Colin faced the very real possibility he would never walk again.</p><p>After graduating from Yale in 2006, Colin left to explore the world on a backpacking trip. While in Thailand, he suffered a tragic accident and was severely burned in a fire. His injuries covered nearly 25% of his body, causing potentially irrevocable damage to his legs and feet.</p><p>Determined to beat the odds, he set a seemingly outlandish goal to not just walk again, but to complete a triathlon following his recovery. Colin didn't just finish a triathlon. In his first attempt he won — stunning the multisport community with an overall amateur title at the prestigious 2009 Chicago Triathlon less than two years post-accident and after only a few months of training.</p><p>On the day immediately following his victory,&nbsp;Colin turned pro, quit his job as a commodities trader, hopped a flight to Australia and spent the next five years representing the United States in triathlon competitions all over the world with a keen eye on landing an Olympic berth.</p><p>Insane.&nbsp;And yet despite his amazing success, Colin sensed something missing from his life.
