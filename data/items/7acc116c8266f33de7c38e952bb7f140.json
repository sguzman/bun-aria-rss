  "description": "<p>John A. Bindernagel (born 1941 - January 18, 2018) was a wildlife biologist who sought evidence for Bigfoot since 1963. He published a book in 1998 entitled North America's Great Ape: the Sasquatch.</p> <p>Bindernagel grew up in Ontario, attended the University of Guelph, and received a PhD in Biology from the University of Wisconsin–Madison. He moved to British Columbia in 1975, largely because the region was a hot spot for Bigfoot sightings.</p> <p>I have invited many friends of the Doc to come on and talk about what John meant to them, and share their memories of him. I will also be playing some clips of past shows with John.</p> <p>Tonight I will be joined by Bob Gimlin, Russell Acord, Derek Randles, Ron Morehead, Paul Graves, Marc Myrsell, Thomas Sewid, Rictor Riolo, Shane Corson, and Todd and Diane Neiss. I know so many people wanted to come on and talk about John and I tried to fit in as many as possible.</p> <p>I think I can sum up the show tonight like this: John was an example of how to be a great human being. He always treated people with respect and was loved and admired by many. I hope when you hear the show you remember John.</p> <p>Check out his website <a href=\"http://sasquatchbiologist.org/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HERE</a>.</p>",
