Then there is the fact that the natural loss of muscle mass and strength as we age is associated with all-cause mortality and linked to the incidence of many chronic diseases like cardiovascular disease and stroke, hypertension, insulin resistance, and type 2 diabetes. This is why muscle mass is not only essential for maintaining a healthy weight, but it’s also a key factor in reducing the risk of chronic disease and improving your healthspan and longevity.&nbsp;</p><br><p>In this episode, I speak with Drs. Stuart Phillips and Chris Rinsch, Dr. Gabrielle Lyon, and Mark Sisson about the importance of supporting our body’s largest organ, muscle.</p><br><p>Dr. Chris Rinsch is co-founder and CEO at Amazentis where he oversees the company’s operations in Switzerland.
