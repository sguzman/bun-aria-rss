  "description": "<p>Coming up next on <em>Radiotopia Presents: My Mother Made Me.</em></p>\n\n<p><em>My Mother Made Me</em> is a series from <em>Radiotopia Presents</em>, where writer Jason Reynolds and his mother, Isabell, explore their shared history, how she raised him, and what they’re teaching each other. It’s a love letter to their connection, an homage to parent-child friendship, and a testament to how growth can be perpetual, despite age or circumstance. Across four episodes, Jason and Isabell go deep – into birth, death and spirituality… but they also keep it light: pushing a cart through Costco, birthday lunches, and hitting the casino together. That’s just how they do.</p>\n\n<p><em>My Mother Made Me</em> is a production of PRX’s Radiotopia and part of <em>Radiotopia Presents</em>, a podcast feed that debuts limited-run, artist-owned series from new and original voices. It is written and narrated by Jason Reynolds with his mother, Isabell Reynolds. The series is produced by Mark Pagán and edited by Julie Shapiro, with production support from Yooree Losordo. Julie Shapiro and Audrey Mardavich are Executive Producers for Radiotopia Presents. Special thanks to LeVar Burton. Cover art by Jason Griffin. Theme song by Christian Reynolds.
