  "description": "Boris Johnson has enjoyed photo opportunities this week with Australian Prime Minister Scott Morrison with the announcement of an ‘in-principle’ free trade agreement between the two countries. It’s the first new one for the UK outside those that already existed through the EU. Great news for biscuit eaters, because Tim Tams are so much better than Penguins. But it’s seen as bad news by UK farmers who adhere to standards that don’t exist in the UK. Like hormone fed beef. So, is it a bad deal? And what about the idea for free trade generally. The argument since Ricardo’s day was that for agricultural it removes the constraint of land and, therefore, the law of diminishing marginal return. That should make goods cheaper, even those made here. Is the theory right?<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
