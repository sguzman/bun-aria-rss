In the words of David Chalmers, \"The hard problem of consciousness is the problem of experience. When we think and perceive, there is a whir of information-processing, but there is also a subjective aspect. As Nagel has put it, there is something it is like to be a conscious organism. This subjective aspect is experience. When we see, for example, we experience visual sensations: the felt quality of redness, the experience of dark and light, the quality of depth in a visual field. What unites all of these states is that there is something it is like to be in them. All of them are states of experience.\" Debating the question, 'Does physicalism address the hard problem of consciousness?' are Philip Goff (www.philipgoffphilosophy.com) and David Papineau (www.DavidPapineau.com).</p>",
