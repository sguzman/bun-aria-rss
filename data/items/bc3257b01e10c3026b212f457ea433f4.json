  "description": "When Vladimir Putin was appointed prime minister in August 1999, he was a political unknown. He quickly made his name by ordering Russian Federation forces to re-take control of the breakaway republic of Chechnya, which just years earlier had fought and won autonomy from Moscow. It would herald the start of a brutal conflict known as the Second Chechen war.  We hear an eyewitness account of the war and its brutal aftermath. \n\nPhoto: A Russian soldier walks through the streets of the destroyed Chechen capital Grozny, February 25, 2000.
