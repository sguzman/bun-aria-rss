  "description": "<div>Aaron Thompson sees the world of the paranormal in a very different and compelling light than most as an after-life researcher. For over twenty years, he has taken a very scientific approach to better understand the supernatural. Yet, an approach that doesn’t dismiss any belief system, but rather seems to meld everything together in a way that makes sense. We last spoke right before the pandemic of 2020, today he joins us again for a three part conversation about the afterlife.<br>\n <br>\n<a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/thegravetalks\"><strong>PART 3 - AVAILABLE TO GRAVE KEEPERS ONLY - LISTEN HERE</strong></a><strong><br>\n</strong><br>\nWhat is Echo Cosmical Ether Mechanics?<br>\n<br>\nDo we create our own ghosts or demons with our energy, example for example slender man?<br>\n<br>\nDoes “echo” mean that the encounters people have are not a conscious interaction, or something like an AI?<br>\n<br>\nPeople often categorize things as either intelligent hauntings or residual hauntings.
