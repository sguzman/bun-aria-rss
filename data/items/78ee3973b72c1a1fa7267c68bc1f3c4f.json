  "description": "<p><strong>As you have a higher libido than your partner, it seems as though it should feel like a blessing</strong> <strong>when he makes sexual advances on you in the middle of the night when his sexsomnia (\"</strong><a href=\"https://www.sleepstation.org.uk/articles/sleep-disorders/sexsomnia/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>a rare sleep disorder</strong></a><strong> in which a person engages in sexual activity during their sleep\") takes over. But this is problematic for two reasons</strong>: A) It briefly triggers your PTSD from being sexually assaulted in your sleep years ago, and B) When your PTSD subsides, you feel guilty for engaging in sex with a partner who can't give consent in the moment (though he has told you on multiple occasions after the fact that he's fine with it).
