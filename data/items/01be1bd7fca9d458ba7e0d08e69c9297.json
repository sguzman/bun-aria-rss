  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, the Democrat party doesn't support Roe v. Wade, what they really favor is infanticide. Americans must push back. Dishonest ideologically driven people who've taken over the Democrat Party want to take over this country by insisting that they destroy our Constitution and whatever they disagree with. Then, high school football Coach Joseph Kennedy was vindicated by the Supreme Court after he was fired for saying a prayer during high school football games. The Supreme Court ruled that this was not a government establishment of religion and that Kennedy's first amendment rights were being violated by the school. Justice Sotomayor, like many others, misunderstood Jefferson's call for a separation between church and state; the phrase appears in a letter he wrote, not in the Constitution. Incidentally, Jefferson was not at the Constitutional convention he was in France, and this very concept of the \"separation between church and state’ was later advanced by a lawyer for the KKK. Later, Democrats incite violence across America. They malign Congresswoman Lauren Boebert in the media. Plus, one Democrat state Senate candidate shows her true colors on a tape leaked by Project Veritas. Afterward, former Sen. Rick Santorum calls in to thank Mark for creating a framework for Conservatives that have worked to train lawyers to adhere to the Constitution. Santorum also voiced support for the Convention of States movement.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
