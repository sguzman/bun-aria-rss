  "description": "Buck flying solo today as Clay hits the links in the LIV golf tournament at Trump's course. We have a .9% GDP decline in Q2. The Biden Recession is official. The Monetary Bathtub Is Overflowing.  Buck says, \"It's cause and effect for you as an individual. Why isn't that clear at the government level as well?\" Many economists say inflation is transitory; it will be persistent and tough, says Buck. White House: Good news, \"recession\" now means \"strong economy\"!  Sen. Tom Cotton says, \"Joe Manchin's 700-page trillion-dollar tax-and-spend bill is probably the longest suicide note in the history of West Virginia.\" JD Vance, Marine, author, Ohio Senate candidate, joins Buck to discuss the Biden Recession (e.g., our crumbling economy), Manchin's betrayal, and the kneecapping of American energy policy. Should Pelosi go to Taiwan? China is displeased. Zelensky and wife raise eyebrows by posing for glossy Vogue cover with famed photographer Annie Leibovitz as the war against Russia rages on -- and in some of their glamor photos is used as the desolate, destroyed backdrop.<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
