  "description": "To commemorate the beginning of summer, we take a look at the issues likely to dominate the headlines between now and Labor Day, from COVID to unrest in the streets, the economic crisis to potential cyberattacks, from foreign policy threats to the navel gazing of the narcissist-in-chief. We talk to Natasha Bertrand, national security correspondent for Politico, Chris Lu, former Cabinet Secretary and Deputy Secretary of Labor for President Obama and David Sanger of the New York Times to try to understand why the weeks just ahead are likely to be unsettling and for many Americans, a deepening crisis. You won't want to miss this insight-rich conversation.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
