The rockets are said to have flown some 130 kilometers, reaching an altitude of 20 kilometers.</p>\n<p>The launches bring the total number of ballistic missile tests conducted by Pyongyang since Wednesday to 30. The heightened activities come as the US and South Korea continue their &lsquo;Vigilant Storm&rsquo; aerial drills, which kicked off on Monday. Aside from firing ballistic missiles, North Korea has held live-fire artillery exercises, along with other military exercises.</p>\n\n            \n    <blockquote>\n        <span><strong>Read more</strong></span>\n        <figure>\n            <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2022.11/thumbnail/6365f09585f5403525744a53.jpg\" alt=\"South Korean F-15K and US F-16 fighter jets fly in formation during a joint drill in an undisclosed location in South Korea, October 4, 2022.\" />\n            <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/565981-south-korea-scramble-jets/\">South Korea scrambles fighter jets</a></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n    </blockquote>\n\n    \n\n<p>Originally scheduled to conclude on Friday, the war games were extended for one additional day, with Pyongyang denouncing the decision as an <em>&ldquo;irrevocable and awful mistake.&rdquo;</em> On Friday, Pyongyang scrambled about 180 fighter jets north of the Military Demarcation Line which separates the two Koreas, in a new show of force.</p>\n<p>This year&rsquo;s &lsquo;Vigilant Storm&rsquo; drills involve some 240 military aircraft and are the largest so far, according to the US Air Force. The joint US-South Korean exercise was first held in 2015 under the name &lsquo;Vigilant Ace&rsquo; and was set to be conducted annually. The drills were put on hold in 2018 when Seoul tried to mend ties with Pyongyang.</p>",
