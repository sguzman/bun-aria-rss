  "description": "In the military, if you've \"lost the bubble,\" then you can't find your bearings. The term first referred to calibrating the position of aircraft and submarines. And the phrase \"the coast is clear\" may originate in watching for invaders arriving by sea. Plus, a dispute over how to pronounce the name of a savory avocado dip. Finally, one more place where people are starting sentences with the word \"So\"--during prayers at church. Also: elbow clerk, smitten, Tennyson's brook, fussbudget vs. fuss-bucket, clinomania, and 50k south of Woop Woop.\n Listen to all episodes for free: https://waywordradio.org/ Â Support the show to keep episodes coming: https://waywordradio.org/donate Â Your responses, questions, and comments are welcomed at any time!Â Â https://waywordradio.org/contact Â words@waywordradio.org Â Listener line 1 (877) 929-9673 toll-free in the US and Canada Â Text/SMS +1 (619) 567-9673 Â Copyright Wayword, Inc., a 501(c)(3) corporation.
