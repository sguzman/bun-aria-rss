The Virtual Museum Experience is a prototype virtual reality application that allows users to experiment with the physical layout of a museum space and the relationship of exhibition objects to each other. By changing the structure of an exhibition, users assume a more active role in constructing meaning and understanding the effects of layouts on spatial narratives and space-use patterns.",
