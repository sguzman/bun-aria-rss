  "itunes:summary": "Donald Trump’s continued insistence that the White House was stolen from him in 2020 has heightened concerns about the integrity of U.S. elections. As America approaches the 2022 midterms and looks ahead to 2024, could the country be careening toward an even greater crisis of democratic legitimacy? Might Democrats also be willing to challenge electoral outcomes in the future if results don’t go their way? And can anything be done to restore faith in the electoral process among millions of skeptical voters?",
