She was scheduled to teach a class there early that morning. Later that day, The Midlothian Police Department released surveillance video from the Church that showed Missy’s killer, dressed in police tactical gear. This person was walking through the halls of the Church, opening doors and breaking glass, prior to Missy’s arrival. Initial reports suggested that Missy may have interrupted a burglary in progress at the Church and had been killed as a result.
