  "description": "<p>As 2021 begins with a flop, America is not the only institution in upheaval. Immediately in conflict, Matt and Bowen rage at each other about recent culture consumption. Ultimately, Matt has promised to watch <em>90 Day Fiancée</em> and Bowen will listen to the song \"driver's license\". So, watch this space. Like they do, Las Culturistas immediately put their differences aside to catch up on culture, and there is a lot to discuss: the attempted insurrection, Trump's ban from Twitter, conclusions on this season of <em>Real Housewives of Potomac</em>, and the beginning of a new season of <em>Drag Race</em>! All discussed! Also, the boys declare their two 2021 missions for the pod: to get Natalie Portman as a guest and to \"top Marc Maron\". All this, Bowen's review of <em>JAWS</em>, Matt's review of <em>The Sound of Music</em>, <em>Rise of Skywalker</em> and <em>Star Wars</em> at large as enjoyable soap opera space camp (and not more than that, nerds!), and... finally... thoughts on TaylOR SwifT's newest album <em>evermore</em>. What would Fran Lebowitz think of the culture you consume? Scary question, scary times, fun episode! xo</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
