  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, Speaker Nancy Pelosi and Minority Leader Chuck Schumer walked out of their meeting with President Trump today, which resulted in Trump calling Pelosi a third-rate politician. This adds more tension to the illegitimate impeachment inquiry Pelosi has been leading and contradicts the precedent set forth by many of these same Democrats during the impeachment of President Bill Clinton. The House explicitly agreed that a resolution voted on by the full House of Representatives \"was necessary\" to proceed with such a serious process. Later, It was a mistake to remove the 50-100 troops stationed in Syria. Now Erdogan feels he has the green light to slaughter the Kurds despite multiple admonishments from the U.S. Afterward, reports now indicate that Adam Schiff pushed Kurt Volker to say he felt pressure from Trump. This is typical of the Democrats and explains why they want to conduct all of these hearings behind closed doors, in secret from the American people. Afterward, Jimmy Kimmel insulted Lara Trump's appearance for defending the President's position on Syria. Were comments like this ever made about President Obama's children or Chelsea Clinton?\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
