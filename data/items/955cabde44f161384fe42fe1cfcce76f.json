  "description": "On Tuesday’s Mark Levin show, CNN and Jim Acosta filed a pathetic lawsuit, with some top gun lawyers, against President Trump and the White House. This isn’t a freedom of the press case, it’s a scam. The purpose of a presidential press conferences is for the American people, not for a reporter to interrupt and give his political opinions. No reporter has a constitutional right to be physically present in the press room, any more than the scores of reporters who are not so lucky as to get a hard pass, to be there in the first place. The left tells us that the framers didn’t envision automatic weapons when creating the second amendment. If that’s that case, did those same framers envision cable TV when creating the first amendment? If you follow left wing logic - CNN has no freedom at all. Also, in our history, we've had several Presidents arrest editors and journalists for printing fake presidential proclamations. Indeed, John Adams, Abraham Lincoln, and Woodrow Wilson have all had reporters jailed. Even Barack Obama prosecuted journalists under the espionage act, more so than any of his predecessors.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
