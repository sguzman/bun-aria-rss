  "description": "<p>Hi Roomies! Enjoy this solo episode with Tess highlighting her favorite esthetics courses to take outside of school! Some classes are free or virtual so there's no reason NOT to continue learning while quarantined. We hope it helps you to go beyond the basic education provided in school. I hope everyone is doing as amazing as they can be in quarantine. I know it can be difficult if you are in esthetician school to stay motivated, keep your eye on the prize and continue to learn. I hope this information is the encouragement you need to keep pushing yourself forward!&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Huge thanks to the sponsors of this episode!</p>\n<p>Explore sponsorship opportunities and start monetizing your podcast by signing up here: <a href=\"https://podcorn.com/podcasters/\" target=\"_blank\">https://podcorn.com/podcasters/</a></p>\n<p>Learn more about how Fastic app can address your health goals: <strong>https://fastic.com/en/home/</strong></p>\n<p><strong>CLASSES MENTIONED</strong></p>\n<p>Skincare Ingredient Knowledge&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Chemical peels</p>\n<p>Lymphatic Drainage</p>\n<p>Advanced Acne</p>\n<p>https://conceptsinstitute.com/course-category/online-courses/</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Advanced Acne</strong></p>\n<p>Douglas Preston for reference (does not teach the class any longer but he has lots of helpful acne resources and sells his tool online): <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/redirect?v=56kxr8ziFwg&redir_token=QUFFLUhqbkNMa3pOajlpRjlkVWhYMklvWV9CR3FQUjVCQXxBQ3Jtc0tsZW9yTFFXUGdISktZdmVVbTJtb1RXZW9KN0F4SDUwTU5LeklYOER5VlV5WnBJUlVId1NKTFU5VmFDWElaVXZLaHRCanJsNUtISm1HTTZGSmFmSkttSHg4dlI1RWlSTXM0aGlrTjEzTHNuTjZCSXlNTQ%3D%3D&event=video_description&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.prestonskincenter.com%2F\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.prestonskincenter.com/</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Michelle at Concepts Institute offers a class</p>\n<p><strong>https://conceptsinstitute.com/course-category/online-courses/</strong></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>How to Eliminate Hyperpigmentation Quickly and Effectively When Treating Multicultural Skin</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Private Label Skincare Course</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Client Retention</strong></p>\n<p>https://www.joelleskincare.com/esthetics-training</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>Tess' Instagram @myestytessa.dermaplus + Tess' YouTube: </em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9XajWH6kxdvL3y6U-czgXQ?view_as=subscriber\"><em>Tess Zolly&nbsp;</em></a></p>\n<p><em>Tess' TikTok: @myestytessa.dermaplus</em></p>\n<p><em>Lauren's Instagram: @laurens.esthetics + Lauren's YouTube: </em><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCU9ElNo5bQmtEcW6EEMDNDQ\"><em>Lauren Kruger</em></a></p>\n<p><em>Lauren's Blog: www.lauren-kruger.com</em></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/liqwyd\">Music by LiQwYd&nbsp;</a></p>\n\n--- \n\nSupport this podcast: <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/the-treatment-room/support\" rel=\"payment\">https://anchor.fm/the-treatment-room/support</a>",
