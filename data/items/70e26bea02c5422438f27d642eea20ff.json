  "description": "<p>It's Small Brown Bike time! I love this band and saw them many times in the early 2000's (and Mike was actually one of the first interviews I ever did when I was writing for zines, remember those?) and fell in love with the band. They've subsequently released more amazing music and been active here and there when shows were a thing. Mike had been on my list for some time to have on the show, and we made it happen. We discuss his life in rural Michigan, being compared to Hot Water Music and following the flow (sounds mysterious, but it makes sense when you listen to the chat).</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
