Aside from its physical manifestations, psoriasis can also result in debilitating psychological effects for those suffering with it. While conventional medicine typically treats psoriasis from the outside in, the reality is that it is an issue that comes from within, and should be treated from the inside out. Things like your genetics, diet, and environmental influences can all contribute to psoriasis.&nbsp;</p><br><p>In this episode, Dr. Hyman sits down with Dr. Todd LePine to discuss the Functional Medicine approach to treating psoriasis. They explain why addressing factors such as gut health, immunity, heavy metals, and more can all be instrumental in healing psoriasis.</p><br><p>Dr. LePine graduated from Dartmouth Medical School and is Board Certified in Internal Medicine, specializing in Integrative Functional Medicine. He is an Institute for Functional Medicine Certified Practitioner. Prior to joining The UltraWellness Center, he worked as a physician at Canyon Ranch in Lenox, MA, for 10 years. Dr. LePine’s focus at The UltraWellness Center is to help his patients achieve optimal health and vitality by restoring the natural balance to both the mind and the body. His areas of interest include optimal aging, bio-detoxification, functional gastrointestinal health, systemic inflammation, autoimmune disorders and the neurobiology of mood and cognitive disorders. Dr. LePine teaches around the world, and has given lectures to doctors and patients at American College for Advancement in Medicine (ACAM), Age Management Medicine Group (AMMG), the University of Miami Integrative Medicine Conference, The Kripalu Center in Lenox, MA, and is on the faculty for American Academy of Anti-Aging Medicine (A4M).
