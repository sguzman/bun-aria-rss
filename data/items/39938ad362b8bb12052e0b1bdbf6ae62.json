  "description": "<p>Today's guest is <a href=\"https://twitter.com/APanagariya\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Arvind Panagariya</a> of Columbia University. We discuss his book, <a href= \"https://global.oup.com/academic/product/free-trade-and-prosperity-9780190914493?cc=us&lang=en&\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Free Trade and Prosperity: How Openness Helps Developing Countries Grow Richer and Combat Poverty</a>.</p> <blockquote><em>Free Trade and Prosperity</em> offers the first full-scale defense of pro-free-trade policies with developing countries at its center. Arvind Panagariya, a professor at Columbia University and former top economic advisor to the government of India, supplies a historically informed analysis of many longstanding but flawed arguments for protection. He starts with an insightful overview of the positive case for free trade, and then closely examines the various contentions of protectionists. One protectionist argument is that \"infant\" industries need time to grow and become competitive, and thus should be sheltered. Other arguments are that emerging markets are especially prone to coordination failures, they are in need of diversification of their production structures, and they suffer from market imperfections. The panoply of protectionist arguments, including those for import substitution industrialization, fails when subject to close logical and empirical scrutiny.</blockquote> <hr /> <p> </p>",
