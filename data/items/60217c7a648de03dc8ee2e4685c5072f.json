  "description": "<p>Today’s episode is to honor my good friend Bob Proctor who passed away on February 4th 2022. He was an entrepreneur, best-selling author, lecturer, and one of the greatest minds in the personal development field. He was also a friend of mine. To honor his life and legacy, I wanted to bring together some of the best moments from my conversations with him. I had the opportunity to interview him 3 different times, and we were setting up our 4th interview just a few weeks ago. Bob was showing up every day to do the work he felt called to do up until the end, which is incredibly inspiring. I had previously asked him what he thought about death and if he was afraid of it. He shared that he wasn’t afraid of death and although you’ve left your physical being, your spiritual being is omnipresent. Bob’s memory will live on in his books, speeches, interviews and all the personal ways he transformed our lives.</p><p>In this episode Bob shares how he thought about building real wealth, how to find control in the middle of chaos, how to overcome self-doubt, how to thrive in your life, how to prime your imagination and so much more!</p><p>For more go to: <a href=\"http://www.lewishowes.com/1227\" target=\"_blank\">www.lewishowes.com/1227</a></p><p>Bob's previous episodes:</p><p><a href=\"http://www.lewishowes.com/835\" target=\"_blank\">www.lewishowes.com/835</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.lewishowes.com/950\" target=\"_blank\">www.lewishowes.com/950</a></p><p><a href=\"http://www.lewishowes.com/1090\" target=\"_blank\">www.lewishowes.com/1090</a></p><p><br /> </p><p> </p>\n",
