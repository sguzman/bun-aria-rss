  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, National Security Advisor John Bolton calls in to discuss the Trump administration’s decision to impose further sanctions on the terrorist regime that rules Iran. The sanctions will seek to reverse the damage done by the Obama administration’s nuclear deal with Iran. The Obama Iran deal didn’t stop Iran’s effort to get deliverable nuclear weapons. It really empowered the regime, which is the world’s central banker for international terrorism. Later, Chuck Todd, Jeffrey Toobin and Michael Steele calling President Trump a racist isn’t impressive. They don't want to have a discussion about race; they want to accuse someone of being a racist. In all of Trump’s years as a businessman he has never been known as a racist. But now all of sudden he's a racist because he gets heckled by Lebron James and maligned by Don Lemon so he strikes back. Being a counter-puncher is not being a racist. In Trump's career he's hired more African Americans than Lebron James, Brian Stelter, and Don Lemon. Trump has helped these employees put food on the table for their families.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
