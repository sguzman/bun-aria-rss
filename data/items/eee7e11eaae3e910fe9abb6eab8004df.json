  "description": "<p>This week, we dive into a successful launch and tease out the lessons we can all learn. Louise recently released her book Life Force which is about the process of making a series of paintings and then she released the actual paintings online. This had always been her plan but along the way, she encountered people who questioned the idea, and suggested that a physical exhibition would be a better idea. Despite temporarily losing focus, she eventually returned to her original vision, a decision which paid off. In this episode, we discuss the importance and value of going your own way with your work, even when (or especially when) you are not sure where it will lead. We also examine how to tune in to inspiration and intuition so that you ARE actually pursuing your own unique direction.</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>Louise's book \"Life Force\" at Bird Eye Books <a href=\"\">https://birdeyebooks.com/products/life-force-a-painters-response-to-the-nature-poetry-of-ted-hughes</a></p>\n<p>See Louise's Ted Hughes paintings online <a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/shop/life-force\">https://www.louisefletcherart.com/shop/life-force</a></p>\n<p>Find our websites and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/\">www.alicesheridan.com&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p>@alicesheridanstudio</p>\n<p>@louisefletcher_art</p>\n<p>Credits: \"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n",
