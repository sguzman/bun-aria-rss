  "description": "The one and only Anthony “The Mooch” Scaramucci—renowned investment banker and former White House Director of Communications—joins me to discuss the volatility and opportunity in Bitcoin and cryptocurrencies. Listen as Anthony gives a macro view on Bitcoin… why El Salvador’s recent adoption of the crypto as a national currency is a huge breakthrough… and how the current crypto market reminds him of the early days of Amazon. [1:40] He explains why cryptos are great for society… and how investors should think about allocating money to the space. [8:00] In addition to Bitcoin and Ethereum, Anthony shares another crypto catching his attention (which also happens to be a  holding)... and why he’s bullish on the massive opportunity in the metaverse. [15:35] Anthony also explains why he believes Bitcoin will hit $500,000 by 2025. [23:00] You probably know of Anthony not just for his prestige as an investor… but also because for the 11 days he served under former President Trump (before ultimately advising a Republican super-PAC to oppose Trump’s reelection).  Anthony gives his take on political bipartisanship… and the structural changes he’d like to see implemented throughout the government. [29:50] And, as a native New Yorker, Anthony shares why he’s excited about the city’s newly elected mayor, Eric Adams. [38:30]   Enjoyed this episode?
