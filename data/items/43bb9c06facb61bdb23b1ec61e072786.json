  "description": "<p>Ed worked at the boarder and in Mexico fighting against the cartels. His conversation with Joe is extremely eye opening to the problems faced with the drug war. There were some brutal stories and sad events. Definitely worth a listen if you don't know much about what goes on in the world of cartels and drug smuggling.</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Enjoy my review folks!</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Please email me with any suggestions and questions for future shows :</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com</p>\n",
