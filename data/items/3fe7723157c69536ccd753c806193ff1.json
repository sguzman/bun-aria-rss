  "description": "I thought that it would be nice to have short and concise summaries of recent projects handy, to share them with a more general audience, including colleagues and students. So, I challenged myself to use fewer than 1000 words without getting distracted by the nitty-gritty details and technical jargon. In this post, I mainly cover some of my recent research in collaboration with the [iPRoBe Lab](http://iprobe.cse.msu.edu) that falls under the broad category of developing approaches to hide specific information in face images. The research discussed in this post is about \"maximizing privacy while preserving utility.\"",
