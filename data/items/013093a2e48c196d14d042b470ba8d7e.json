  "description": "We break down the previous year of the Biden administration's errors, idiocy and lies that have fueled and worsened record high inflation. Rick & Bubba saw \"Top Gun: Maverick\" and deny that it made them cry, but admit that there are some movies that can make them misty. And lastly, an Alabama woman gets revenge on her ex by driving a semi-truck into his mobile home. \nSponsor: RealEstateAgentsITrust.com - Buying or selling a home is already one of the most stressful things you can do – and it can be ten times worse if you’re not working with the right agent.  Generally speaking, our homes are our biggest investment – that’s a lot of responsibility, and you need an agent who can take that seriously. That’s why we recommend Real Estate Agents I Trust. We work with only the best agents in every market.  We do our homework, talking to every agent before inviting them to join our network – and here’s a big one: we only work with full-time professionals…no part-time or inexperienced agents.  Our team makes the introduction, and then follows you through the buying or selling process to make sure that you’re satisfied. The agents we work with have long track records, and are the best sellers in their field.  They’re a part of this audience; they share your values, and they’re almost anywhere you want to go! The process is simple: just go to https://RealEstateAgentsITrust.com today and provide us with some basic info. Our team will contact you to make an introduction to our preferred agent in your town.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
