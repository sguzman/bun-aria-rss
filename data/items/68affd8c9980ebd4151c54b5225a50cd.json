Emerging research is helping us look at new ways to treat and even prevent devastating neurological diseases like Alzheimer’s and dementia, giving people a newfound sense of hope.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In today’s episode, I talk with Dr. Marwan Sabbagh, Dr. Richard Isaacson, and Dr. Jay Lombard about the role of genetics in brain disorders, lifestyle habits you can start right now to reduce your risk or reverse symptoms, and why we need to look at bacteria as a cause of neurodegenerative disease.&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Marwan Sabbagh is a board-certified neurologist and considered one of the leading experts in Alzheimer’s and dementia. He is on the editorial board for the <em>Journal of Alzheimer's Disease</em> and <em>BMC Neurology</em> and is now Editor-in-Chief of <em>Neurology and Therapy. Dr. Sabbagh </em>is the author of <em>The Alzheimer’s Answer: Reduce Your Risk and Keep Your Brain Healthy</em> and <em>The Alzheimer’s Prevention Cookbook: 100 Recipes to Boost Brain Health</em>.

Dr. Lombard integrates biological, psychological, and existential components in his holistic treatment approach. Dr. Lombard’s clinical experience revealed an interesting pattern: one patient with ALS also had small-intestine bacterial overgrowth, another had ulcerative colitis, yet another had Crohn’s, and so on. He started seeing the connections between these bacterial imbalances and Clostridium difficile, or C. diff, and the link to neurological symptoms.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This episode is brought to you by Athletic Greens and ButcherBox.</p><br><p>Right now, when you purchase AG1 from Athletic Greens, you will receive 10 FREE travel packs with your first purchase by visiting <a href=\"http://athleticgreens.com/hyman\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">athleticgreens.com/hyman</a>.</p><br><p>When you sign up today, ButcherBox will send you two pounds of sustainably caught, wild Alaskan salmon in your first box for free.
