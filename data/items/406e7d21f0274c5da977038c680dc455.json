  "description": "<p>Legendary pro skater and Subaru pro driver Bucky Lasek (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/buckylasek\">@BuckyLasek</a>) joins us this week.  We of course talk about Bucky's impressive career as a pro skater with too many medal finishes to count but we really dig into his current focus in the rally world.  Bucky now drives for Subaru and has become a very accomplshed driver steadily climbing the ranks of the rally scene and even stealing the occassional win in other formats. We also get into Bucky's love of Porsches, Zack's run in with Google employees, an alphabet soup of BMWs and Pikes Peak vs Mt. Washington.</p>\n",
