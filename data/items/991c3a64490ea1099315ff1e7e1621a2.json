  "description": "It's this important moment and you have to walk up to a Taylor Swift song.. What song would you choose? Lacey, Ana, Amy and Nick choose songs for when they walk up during these particular moments... and a couple of them may have gone overboard with their choices. Why would you pick just a few songs when you can pick several for many different moments!<br />What would your 'walk up' song be? Is there a good one that we didn't mention?
