  "description": "On today's show, Pat is joined by former NFL Running Back and current President of the Washington Football Team, Jason Wright. Pat and Jason discuss how difficult of a challenge it has been taking everything over in the midst of what seems like a firestorm, how he's been trying to build and establish the culture with Ron Riveria both in the building and the locker room, what made him feel like he was prepared for the job, and how he isn't naive about how difficult of a challenge it will be (1:01-21:34). Next, Super Bowl Champion, Pro Bowler, All-Pro, Pat's former teammate, and Iowa Football legend, Dallas Clark joins the program. Pat and Dallas chat about everything you could imagine from their time as teammates together, some hilarious stories about one another, why he never wore gloves, how he's one of the most competitive human beings on the planet, and why he ultimately decided to move back to Iowa (23:07-56:21). Next, on another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk, Pat and AJ are joined by former 1st round pick of the Dallas Cowboys, Ohio State Legend, General of the Big Ten Army, Gen. Bob Carpenter. Pat, AJ, and the General discuss everything going on in the Big Ten right now, what Bob is hearing from his sources on the battlefield, why he doesn't want football to become a bipartisan issue, what needs to happen to resume the season, and if he's confident that it will get done in time (57:04-1:18:41). To close out the show, ESPN MMA Insider and friend of the program, Ariel Helwani joins the show. Pat and Ariel discuss the possibilities of Jorge Masvidal and Nate Diaz meeting again for the BMF belt, whether or not he thinks Brock Lesnar will ultimately end up in the UFC to fight Jon Jones, his relationship with Dana White, and why it is that people hate him (1:18:43-1:34:54). We appreciate you all for letting us penetrate your ear holes. Come and laugh with us, cheers.\n",
