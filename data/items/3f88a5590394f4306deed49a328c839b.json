  "description": "<p>Can genuine friends truly transition into longterm romantic and sexual partners? Is it more ideal to gradually walk into love WITH someone who’s already your best friend OR fall in love and then become best friends?<br>\n </p>\n<p>According to a 2021 study published in Social Psychological and Personality Science finds that two thirds of romantic couples started out in a platonic relationship. Yes, 68% reported that their current romantic relationship began as a friendship! And the rate of friends to lovers was even higher among 20 somethings and within the LGBTQ+ communities with 85% reported that their relationship began as a friendship. And more interestingly I think, only 30% said they were sexually attracted to the partner from the very beginning. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>You might be like, why is this so shocking to you and it’s because in essence our generation might be rewriting the traditionally understood blueprint for forming romantic bonds.</p>\n<p><br>\n </p>\n<p>This is what we discuss with guests Ezee and Natalie, two comedic-content creators turned collaborators turned best friends turned lovers, who have shared every part of their journey online and thus have sparked a lot of conversations about whether plutonic friends really shift to romantic lovers in a way that is both equal and sustainable? And with Hotline Bling producer plus half of DVSN's Nineteen85 aka Paul Jefferies.</p>\n<p><br>\n </p>\n<p><br>\n </p>\n<p>Follow Shan on Instagram: <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__http:/www.instagram.com/shanboody__;!!NUnUjx3wvH5xgA!cKqcA-rtjNyj3DAoZBkUePe7QMKLqZHQ1k9efGQnAkNXT-gGgic8_tUktm2eSwLUCgMgK0tikPuaCXFyPIHhG0lB%24\">www.instagram.com/shanboody</a></p>\n<p>Call in to the show to leave a voice note<br>\n </p>\n<p>‪(323) 375-4797<br>\n<a href=\"mailto:loversfriendspodcast@gmail.com\">loversfriendspodcast@gmail.com</a><br>\n </p>\n<p><br>\n </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Follow the guests on this episode </strong></p>\n<p><br>\n </p>\n<p><br>\n </p>\n<p><strong>Ezee </strong><br>\n </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ezee\">https://www.instagram.com/ezee</a><br>\n </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/youngezee\">https://www.youtube.com/c/youngezee</a><br>\n </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/ezeexnatalie\">https://www.youtube.com/c/ezeexnatalie</a><br>\n </p>\n<p><br>\n </p>\n<p><strong>Natalie</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/natalie.odell/\">https://www.instagram.com/natalie.odell/</a><br>\n </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/NatalieOdellXo\">https://www.youtube.com/c/NatalieOdellXo</a><br>\n </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/ezeexnatalie\">https://www.youtube.com/c/ezeexnatalie</a><br>\n </p>\n<p><br>\n </p>\n<p><strong>Nineteen85</strong><br>\n </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nineteen85_\">https://www.instagram.com/nineteen85_</a><br>\n </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/dvsn\">https://www.instagram.com/dvsn</a><br>\n </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9xq-hVeC-OJHvWOxGydo9g\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UC9xq-hVeC-OJHvWOxGydo9g</a><br>\n </p>\n<p><br>\n </p>\n\n",
