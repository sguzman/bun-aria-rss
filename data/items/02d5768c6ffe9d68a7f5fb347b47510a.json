  "description": "<p>The name The Movement for the Restoration of the Ten Commandments of God might not sound familiar, but in the world of cults, it should be. Only one cult in modern history has ever had more people die in its final act, the Peoples Temple's Jonestown Massacre.  778 people died in Uganda in early 2000 - murdered by cult leaders who had failed to correctly predict the day the world would end and the apocalypse would begin, on four different occasions. Today we explore what this cult was about - including the messages its leaders received from their preposterous \"visions\" of Mother Mary - and we also explore how and why this cult was able to flourish in Uganda in the 1990s. Decades of chaos had left many in the nation ready to receive proclamations of an impending apocalypse. <br /><br /><strong>Get tour tickets at </strong><a href=\"https://dancummins.tv/\"><strong>dancummins.tv </strong></a><br /><br /><strong>Get Scared to Death LIVE tickets at </strong><a href=\"https://badmagicmerch.com/\"><strong>badmagicmerch.com</strong></a><strong>  October  27th, 6P PST/9PM EST.
