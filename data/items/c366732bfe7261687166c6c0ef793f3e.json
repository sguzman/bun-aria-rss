  "description": "Phil shares a cringe-worthy coffee catastrophe, courtesy of Dan. Phil, Jase, and Al try to figure out why some people can't stand to be called \"sir\" or \"ma'am,\" and they ponder why it drives some people crazy to have a door held open for them. The guys discuss recognizing people by the fruit they bear, and Jase says we have too many rock-throwers and not enough foot-washers. Phil also explains what a \"stem-winder of a hairdo\" is.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
