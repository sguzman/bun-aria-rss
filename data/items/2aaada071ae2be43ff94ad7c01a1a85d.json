  "description": "<p>Over the past few decades, Seth Godin has made quite a ruckus in nearly every domain he's explored, from business to marketing to education, innovation and beyond, in no small part by encouraging us all to join him in purposeful ruckus-making, too. He's launched a number of successful companies, taught millions of people and left his mark on our creative culture. And, he’s written, just a bit. In fact he writes daily at Seths.blog, which is one of the most popular blogs in the world. He's the founder of the altMBA and The Akimbo Workshops, online seminars that have transformed the work of thousands of people.&nbsp;</p><p>Seth is the author of 19 international bestsellers translated into more than 35 languages, including Purple Cow, Linchpin, The Dip, and This Is Marketing, and now his latest <em>New York Times</em> bestseller, <a href=\"https://bookshop.org/books/the-practice-shipping-creative-work/9780593328972\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Practice</a>, an insightful and provocative look at how to get more out of the work we do by giving more to it, to the world and to ourselves. Or, as he describes it, you’ll learn to dance with your fear, take the risks worth taking, and embrace the empathy required to make work that contributes with authenticity and joy. And that’s what we explore in today’s conversation.</p><br><p>You can find Seth Godin at:</p><p><a href=\"https://www.sethgodin.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Website</a> : https://www.sethgodin.com/</p><p><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/sethgodin\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> : https://www.facebook.com/sethgodin</p><br><p><strong>Check out our offerings & partners:&nbsp;</strong></p><ul><li><strong>My New Book </strong><a href=\"https://sparketype.com/book/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sparked</a></li><li><strong>My New Podcast </strong><a href=\"https://pod.link/1610198312\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">SPARKED</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.goodlifeproject.com/sponsors/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Visit Our Sponsor Page For a Complete List of Vanity URLs & Discount Codes.</a></li></ul><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
