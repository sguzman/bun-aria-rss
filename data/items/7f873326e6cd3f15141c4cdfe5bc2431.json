  "description": "Hey everyone! This week we've got a super sweet novella called Love's Serenade by Sheryl Lister. It wasn't a home run for us, but we loved being thoroughly steeped in 1920's Harlem as we watched Leigh and Miles find each other again. Plus, there were a ton of super impactful historical easter eggs throughout! And hot sex! It's part of the \"Decades: A Journey of African American Romance\" series. \n Bonus Content: bedside chocolate, squirrels carrying another squirrel in it's mouth, we're famous, alcoholic mango chunks, Mel's drunk, rent parties, Langston Hughes and Zora Neale Hurston, Art Sculptures of the rural 1920s, \"catch my farts,\" and so much more. \n Lady Loves: \n Mel: Bedside chocolate. What a lovely surprise! And using frozen mango chunks as ice cubes in cocktails. Yum!\n Erin: The Scream franchise! They're 1/3 slasher film, 1/3 satire, and 1/3 straight up comedy. \n Subscribe!

Growing up, Kanaloa was my third favorite Hawaiian god behind Pele and Hi’iaka. And he might be the origin of my love for octopodes. In myths he is powerful, yet flexible, and can get out of any scrape he finds himself in. He’s the deity Hawaiians called on when wayfinding because he’s the navigator. He’s the subtle compliment to Hawaii’s chief god Kane. Don’t believe the haoles who say that Kanaloa is evil, or Hawaii’s devil. That’s some judeo-christian projection that happened after missionaries colonized the islands and started bastardizing their culture. He’s flexible, intelligent, and multifaceted, just like you.\nMentioned in this episode:\nCheck out Literary Souvenirs for all your Bookish and BTS Merch! \nBookish Merch IG : http://instagram.com/literarysouvenirs\nBTS Merch IG : https://instagram.com/btssouvenirs\nTwitter : https://twitter.com/abooktrotter\nhttps://heaving-bosoms.captivate.fm/literarysouvenirs (Literary Souvenirs Etsy!)\nPreorder Naima Simone X Friends Book Boyfriend Box!!\nThis box has EVERYTHING you could ever want in a book boyfriend from Tessa Bailey, Avery Flynn, Farrah Rochon, Jayci Lee, Kennedy Ryan, Adriana Herrera, and Naima Simone.\nYou can look forward to paperbacks, signed book plates, limited edition book boyfriend mugs, the book boyfriend pajamas/loungewear, bookmarks and more!\nTiers include:\n- Cinnamon Roll - $114.99\n- The Alpha - - $169.99 \nEnter the promo code BONKERS10 at checkout to receive $10 off!!! \nONLY AVAILABLE UNTIL OCT 10, 2022!\nIf you have any questions, email orders@honeymagnolia.co.\nhttps://heaving-bosoms.captivate.fm/nsbookboyfriends (Naima's Book Boyfriends)\nSeptember in the Temple!\n- This month we're back with Katee regaling us with more Fertile in My Ex-Boyfriend’s Dungeon (and we discover an actual hard limit for Katee!), and Hannah Whitten is going to stop by to give us all her best spooky season recs. \n- In Book Club news, everyone in the Joy Bringer and Celebrant tiers can download their ebooks of MY WICKED PRINCE by Molly O’Keefe and the entire audiobook collection of COURT OF THE VAMPIRE QUEEN by Katee Robert! \n- And finally, Joy Bringers and Celebrants can check out all the digital art we’ve created for the Temple!
