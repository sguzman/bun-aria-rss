  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, WREC Radio Host Ben Ferguson fills in for Mark. Ironically, there are no videos of people on airplanes fighting to keep their masks on now that the federal mask mandate was struck down by a federal court. However, the White House will have you believe that it was only one video on one U.S plane where the passengers cheered mid-flight at the announcement that the mandate was over. The White House and the Justice Department announced that they will fight to regain the CDC's power over the public's transportation system. In contrast, the southern Border remains chaotically open. Then, President Joe Biden has become the biggest drug dealer in America as fentanyl is now killing four times more people than it did before he took office. Yet, Biden gets scared by the Easter Bunny, gets lost outside his house, and shakes hands with the air. Later, the left has now resorted to lies. An MSNBC Medical Contributor and former Obama policy staffer, Dr. Patel, says that people should carry masks with them and lie to others about having a child with cancer to guilt them into wearing a mask. Afterward, Jen Psaki may be under federal investigation for disparaging a competitor of her future employer (MSNBC) as Psaki has announced that she is leaving the White House. A watchdog group is demanding an ethics investigation into any conflicts there may have been. Finally, go woke or go broke. Former AG Loretta Lynch's firm has been hired to conduct a 'racial equity audit' at Amazon. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
