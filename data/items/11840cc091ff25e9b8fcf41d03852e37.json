  "description": "<p>An epic final day is in the history books, as is another Olympic Closing Ceremony, and we're back for another epic episode to wrap up everything that we saw, loved and didn't love on day 16 of the Tokyo 2020 Olympics! Just why are Olympic ceremonies seemingly getting worse and worse? Did anything actually happen during the Closing Ceremony or are we still waiting? Why was the star of the Closing Ceremony a moth?

And why are we looking forward to competitive jet fighting at Paris 2024 the most? It's one massive episode that you simply can't miss so make sure to get to listening!</p>",
