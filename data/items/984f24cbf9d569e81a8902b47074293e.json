They are so easy, even I can keep them:</p> <ol> <li>Have a wine from a region you’ve never heard of or had before! Expand your palate, do a little research, and try something totally new. <br /> <br /></li> <li>Have wine from a region that you have hated in the past. Wine is constantly changing, especially with climate change so a region you may have thought was yucky in the past, may very well have turned into your next favorite wine hub!<br /> <br /></li> <li>Drink more of the wine you love but always forget about! We all have one of those. When you get it you say to yourself, “why don’t I drink more of this? It’s so great!”</li> </ol> <p><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/tim-mossholder-I-_7kNyN-JE-unsplash.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"250\" height=\"167\" /></p> <p>Here are the show notes on the role of alcohol in wine:</p> <p><strong>__________________________________________</strong></p> <p><strong>Alcohol levels are largely determined in the vineyard:</strong></p> <ul> <li>Sugar is converted to alcohol during fermentation, so sugar levels in a vineyard are essential to determining how much potential alcohol a wine can have.
