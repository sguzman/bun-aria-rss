  "description": "<p>The Hamilton County Jail was open for nearly 100 years and housed a variety of criminals, both men and women. Many people died here and at least three were executed and there are several bodies buried on the property. This has lead to claims of hauntings and based on our experiences, we would agree that this location is very active. Join us as we share our investigation of the Old Hamilton County Jail.
