  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this episode, Marc works with 41-year old Lisa who is battling body image challenges. She frequently judges her body, and often compares herself to others. She’d like to lose about 10 pounds, but more than anything she just wants to be free of body judgment. She knows she can find a happier and more peaceful relationship with herself, she just doesn’t quite know how.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As they explore in her coaching session, Lisa learned early on as an 8-year old soccer player. She remembers noticing other girls’ legs, comparing hers to theirs, and wondering if hers were “right.” A lot of life has been lived since then - she’s grown up, been married, gotten divorced, switched careers, and is now in a wonderful new relationship with a man who loves her appearance. But she still finds that old familiar voice of comparison and judgment present at different times.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">As you’ll hear, Marc coaches Lisa and the rest of us who are challenged with body image to embrace self-awareness before trying to get to the holy grail of self-acceptance. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Some of what they explore:</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">✅</span><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">The role of cultural conditioning around competition and “winning” when it comes to weight and body image</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">✅</span> <span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">The gift of maturation that arrives around the age of 40 for both women and men, and how the “Queen-in-Training” (or “King-in-Training”) archetypes can help us overcome challenges with body image</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">✅</span> <span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Why having a “perfect” weight number in your head is an unhelpful concept</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">✅</span> <span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">How fear of gaining weight creates a stress response in our body, which in turn makes it harder for the body to lose weight</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">✅</span> <span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">And much more…</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">---------------</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Learn more about us at The Institute for the Psychology of Eating:</span> <a href= \"https://psychologyofeating.com/\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">https://psychologyofeating.com/</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">👉 We’re now enrolling for The Mind Body Eating Coach Certification Training!
