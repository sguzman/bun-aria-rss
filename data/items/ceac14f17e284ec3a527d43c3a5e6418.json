  "description": "Today we started a brand new series entitled, “Upset The World” with our Oversight Pastor Tim Ross! Aside from being the oversight pastor of Transformation Church,  he is the lead pastor of the multi-ethnic, multi-generational Embassy City Church in Irving, TX. His dynamic teaching style and uncanny ability to make people understand the gospel message is the reason why he has been such an asset to ministries across cultural and denominational lines. Pastor Tim is happily married to Juliette, and they have two sons. <br /><br />In Part 1 of Upset The World, we learned that we might need to let go of some things, even our religion, in order to truly Upset the World. Check out this message now to see what we are talking about!",
