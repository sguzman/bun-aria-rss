  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, why would the FBI send 30 Agents to raid former President Trump's private home when they could have simply asked for the documents or issued a subpoena for them? They found nothing tying Trump to sedition, fraud, or obstruction, and the federal government hasn't said anything regarding the warrant that remains sealed. Whether initiated by Trump through courts or by the DOJ, unsealing the warrant may reveal the classified nature of the documents in question, so it's likely that the warrant will remain sealed. It's also interesting that this warrant was unusually signed by the lowest level judge in the federal system (a magistrate) who is on record as a donor to Obama's campaign and defended Jeffrey Epstein's pilots. This seems like a crime in search of evidence and since the DOJ doesn't have any, it's a new witch hunt. Then, a sitting Congressman has had his phone seized by the FBI and the Biden DOJ is on a mission to criminalize politics to find anything they can to try and tie Donald Trump to one of the statutes to prevent his future pursuit of public office. They also hope to tarnish all Republicans in the November election when they release their findings or take their next action in October of this year, just in time for the mid-term elections. Afterward, the minority controls the various levers of power, but the silent majority has the power to effectuate change. The majority must believe that its actions can save the nation.  \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
