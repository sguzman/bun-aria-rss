  "description": "<p>Sometimes a place is needed to help with reforming young people when they wander down the wrong road in life. That is what the Ohio State Reformatory was originally meant to do: help wayward young men get back on the right road. The beautiful Gothic reformatory built of iron and limestone is so picturesque that it was used as a location in the movie, \"The Shawshank Redemption.\" But what happened to many of the residents of this building was anything, but beautiful and certainly was not about truly reforming young men. Stories that include torture, beatings and other misdeeds are numerous. And wherever strong emotions are built up, we usually find some kind of unexplained phenomenon. Come with us as we venture inside the Ohio State Reformatory! The Moment in Oddity features the Hammersmith Ghost and This Day in History features a pretender claiiming the throne as King Richard IV.</p> <p>Check out the website:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/09/hgb-podcast-ep-66-ohio-state-reformatory.html\">http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/09/hgb-podcast-ep-66-ohio-state-reformatory.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer of the show:  <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p>",
