  "description": "<p><p>Feitelberg via satellite to update us on the St. Louis guys getting dominated by Dave and the Boston crew. The White Knights and Blue Check brigade have a problem with the Bruins letting Barstool sponsor rally towels. Best mainstream movie sex scenes, worst TV shows/movies if they came out in the social media era, getting intimidated by hot girls, and taking nudes in advance. The Short Porch idiots (Hubbs & Tommy Smokes) join to talk Mets and Yankees. Luke Voit, fat Gary Sanchez, Pete Alonso, the Red Sox disaster of a bullpen, and who will sign Kimbrel.</p><p>Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
