  "description": "<p>This week we talk about life. This episode is going to cause you to really evaluate what’s IMPORTANT to YOU, WHO and WHAT MATTERS and maybe a few of your priorities will shift.<br /><br />I invited one of my best friends into the studio for a wide-ranging talk about important parts of YOUR LIFE that you may not usually pay much attention to.<br /><br />Jenna is special, dispensing life advice through her enormously successful podcast, as an acclaimed author, educator, and thought leader. She’s got a new book out, HOW ARE YOU, REALLY? LIVING YOUR TRUTH ONE ANSWER AT A TIME, which is all about what it means to live a life that doesn’t just LOOK GOOD, it FEELS GOOD, too.<br /><br />For those of you who are feeling your life is off track now, Jenna is going to help you right your ship and get back to living your best life.<br /><br />It’s okay to be a HARD CHARGER, but as Jenna explains, never underestimate the need and the importance of REST. Rest is counter to what many success-driven people are programmed to do, but you need to find it or run the risk of crashing hard.<br /><br />Jenna also delves into why it’s important to know yourself better and what questions you need to ask to make that happen.  <br /><br />Am I HAPPY?<br /><br />What does SUCCESS look like for me?<br /><br />Am I FAKING enjoying life?<br /><br />How CONFIDENT am I?<br /><br />We also get into SEASONS of your life and TIPPING POINT MOMENTS where what used to make you happy may not be the case as much anymore.  <br /><br />We’re also going to ask you to think about BURN OUT. Are you a person who can function even when you’re burned out? What are you doing to RECHARGE your mind and body because sooner or later, burnout will catch up to you.<br /><br />Some of you also don’t have the best relationship with your bodies. Pay attention to what Jenna has to say about the relationship between your soul and your body.<br /><br />How many of you fear losing MOMENTUM? Jenna’s got some great insights if that’s one of the things you’re worried about, too.<br /><br />We also spend a lot of time talking about your VISION about what you want for your life. When was the last time you thought about...<br /><br />How do you block out DISTRACTIONS?  <br /><br />How do you handle OTHER PEOPLE’S IDEAS about what you should do?  <br /><br />Does your vision vibe with your VALUES and YOUR IDEA OF SUCCESS?<br /><br />And most important, when was the last time you CHECKED IN WITH YOUR VISION and asked HOW SHOULD IT FEEL?<br /><br />So many BIG QUESTIONS to think about this week!<br /><br />Don’t just listen to what Jenna has to say. Absorb it. Process it. <br /><br />And then take the actions you need to give a great answer when somebody asks you, “How are you, really?”</p><p>For more on Jenna's book:<a> http://howareyoureallybook.com/</a></p><p> </p>\n",
