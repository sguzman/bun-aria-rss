  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Moving is hard. One day, you’re packing a box faster than your toddler can unpack it, and the next, you need Google maps to find the kids’ new school. Your family can feel uprooted, discouraged, exhilarated, and adventurous all on the same day. In this episode, Emily and Laura discuss the challenges of moving with littles (which overlaps with any season of transition!). While moving is hard and full of unknowns, we can be sure God has a plan, and it’s a good one. These days, months, or even years aren’t throwaway seasons. By God’s grace, they’re times of pruning and growth in our hearts, leading us to joy in Christ—not our circumstances. </span></p> <p><strong><em>We’re grateful to Christian Standard Bible, a Bible translation for everyone, for making this week’s show possible.</em> <em>Whether reading to a child or teaching in your women’s ministry, the CSB will be accurate, readable, and shareable.
