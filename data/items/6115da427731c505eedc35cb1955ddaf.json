  "title": "Heaven and Earth Part 1: What is the Old Testament referring to as \"Heaven\"?",
  "description": "<p>In this episode, Tim and Jon begin their conversation about heaven and earth starting in Genesis 1. This is the first time “heaven\" appears in the Bible. “The heavens” literally means “the sky.” Did the ancient Israelites think God lived in the sky? Maybe. The guys will talk more about this and what it means for God’s space and human space to overlap.</p>\n<p>In the first part of the episode (01:27-08:57), the guys talk about the idea that heaven is in the clouds. How did we get there? Tim will break down the Hebrew word for heaven and explain a bit more about what the ancient Israelites believed about God’s heavenly space.</p>\n<p>In the second part of the episode (09:17-18:59), the guys will talk about the significance of temples for the ancient Israelites. Temples were the place where the divine and human space overlapped, and this was incredibly important to the ancient Israelites.<br />\nIn the next part of the episode (19:19-25:15), Tim and Jon talk about Jesus as the ultimate meeting place of heaven and earth. Throughout the gospels, Jesus calls himself the temple of God and makes clear that he is God’s temple presence made accessible for humanity.</p>\n<p>In the final part of the episode (25:45-40:57), the guys talk about the ways we see this overlap between heaven and earth throughout Scripture. We see it through Jesus, through visions of heaven, like Jacob has in Genesis 28, and ultimately we see it in the garden of Eden.</p>\n<p>Video:<br />\nThis episode is designed to accompany our video called, “Heaven & Earth.\" You can view it on our youtube channel here: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zy2AQlK6C5k</p>\n<p>Scripture References:<br />\nGenesis 1<br />\nGenesis 28<br />\nPsalm 11<br />\nPsalm 103<br />\n1 Kings 8<br />\nIsaiah 6</p>\n<p>Show Music:<br />\nDefender Instrumental by Rosasharn Music<br />\nAnalogs by Greyflood</p>\n",
