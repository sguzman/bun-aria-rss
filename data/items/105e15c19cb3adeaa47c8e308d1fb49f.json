  "description": "Radio host James T. Harris joins the program to express his conviction of why the 2010s have been the greatest decade of all time. Economics and living standards are better than ever both at home and abroad, yet the Democrats and young socialists can’t see the forest for the trees. Allow us to review what an awful year it was for the mainstream media. The Covington kids, Jussie Smollett, the Mueller report, Greta Thunberg, Jeffrey Epstein’s crimes – the list of fiascoes just goes on and on. And Michael Moore telling you to fear two out of three white men (because they voted for Trump) is indicative of something much more sinister emanating from the Left.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
