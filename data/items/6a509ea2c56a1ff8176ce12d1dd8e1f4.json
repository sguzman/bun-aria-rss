  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, Brian Mudd from WJNO fills in. Are we stuck on stupid, regarding the border and updated immigration info? In 2006 we had the proliferation of the border wall and 600 miles were constructed, then came Barack Obama and the wall went awry but the media never mentions that. The most pervasive media bias is omission and if you don’t know you can’t appreciate how screwed up politicians are. Then, the real story of Anthony Kennedy and myth of swing justices. Anthony Kennedy's record is actually more conservative than Sen. Marco Rubio's. Kennedy has voted with Chief Justice Roberts , Justice Alito and former Justice Scalia more than 80% of the time. Afterwards, Facebook's Declaration of Independence error and apology & the new threat of big tech. Finally, American defectors renouncing their citizenship is on the decline, in part, because of the Trump tax cuts.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
