  "description": "<p>QAnon is the conspiracy cult involving so, so many things. It MOSTLY centers around belief in an elite, leftist, Satanic, child sex trafficking slash human sacrifice slash adrenochrome harvesting ring and the one man thought to be destined to expose and destroy this Deep State, evil, globalist cabal - former president Donald Trump. Seriously. That's really what it is.</p>\n<p>Antifa is a left-wing political ideology, made up of various autonomous groups that often include communists, socialists, and anarchists, that violently oppose fascism and other far right-wing ideologies, often through militant protest tactics. They believe in de-platforming any group they deem xenophobic, racist, homophobic, sexist, etc. They fight intolerance with intolerance and their counter-protests often spiral out into not just assault but property damage. <br /><br />We explore each of these belief systems today, see how they intersect, and look at how one led to the infamous storming of the US capitol on Jan. 6th. Wtf and Hail Nimrod!<br /><br />Thanks for helping Bad Magic Productions donate $13,300 this month to<strong> The Saint</strong> <strong>Bernard Project.</strong> The SBP will be helping those in Texas, Oklahoma, and Louisiana as they continue to work on their recovery from winter storm Uri.
