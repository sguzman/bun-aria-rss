  "description": "<p>Andrew McCabe served as the Deputy Director – and briefly the Acting Director – of the FBI at the end of a fascinating career in federal law enforcement. A graduate of Duke University and the Washington University School of Law, Andrew shares his experience as a new agent at the FBI Training Academy in Quantico, Virginia and his early work fighting Russian organized crime on the streets of New York City. After 9/11, Andy’s focus – and the focus of the FBI – shifted to counterterrorism.<br />\nOn The Oath, Andrew examines that shift, including how then FBI Director Bob Mueller led the work of the FBI, the difference between “muscling” and “targeting,” and the Bureau’s successful rapport-building approach to interviews. As the Assistant Director of the FBI’s Counterterrorism Division in 2013, he also describes the FBI’s remarkable hunt to catch the killers responsible for the Boston Marathon bombing. Andy is the author of the best-selling book, The Threat. <br />\nEmail the show at theoathpodcast@gmail.com.</p>\n",
