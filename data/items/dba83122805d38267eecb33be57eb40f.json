  "description": "<p>ROUND 1: Allll aboard… We are goin’ off the rails to tell you the story of a man who tried to take out the USNS Comfort this week… with a train!\n\nROUND 2: Social distancing is pretty much impossible on Navy ships and that’s become apparent as over 100 Sailors on an aircraft carrier have come down with Coronavirus. As the situation worsens one Captain on the ship has put their neck out to plead with officials to do the right thing and take steps to stop the spread.\n\nROUND 3: Thousands of folks still stuck on cruise ships might get excited when they see the Coast Guard coming but they shouldn’t get their hopes up because they’re droppin’ a big ‘ol basket of bad news on ‘em.  \n\nROUND 4: Career day\n\nROUND 5: Another game from Kate and she’s informed me that this time it’s a quiz of random military questions from WWII to veteran Porn that popped into her head with no rhyme or reason. Sounds awesome & you can play along, too..</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
