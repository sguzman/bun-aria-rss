  "description": "On The Gist, Democrats bob and weave around the question of abortion. \nIn the interview, victims of crimes are often sidelined in the judicial process—the perpetrator is punished, but his or her target isn’t given the opportunity to set up the kind of face-to-face meeting that might help them heal. Restorative justice seeks to change that, and Lara Bazelon is out with a book on how it applies to those who have been exonerated after wrongful convictions. Bazelon is an associate professor at the University of San Francisco School of Law, and the author of Rectify: The Power of Restorative Justice After Wrongful Conviction. \nIn the Spiel, even with every benefit of the doubt, Elizabeth Warren’s policy ideas just aren’t fundable.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
