  "description": "Snow can be a calming presence. But it can also act as a veil of secrecy, covering up things we’d rather leave alone. Today’s stories rise up from those icy, frigid sheets and enter our homes, turning our warm bodies… into frozen souls. First, Sapphire shares the grisly tale of Serbia’s first vampire. Next, Markeia investigates the story of some strange-looking snowmen around campus. After that, we’ll work a night shift in the middle of a blizzard. And finally we’ll climb a snowy mountain, guarded by a defensive spirit.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
