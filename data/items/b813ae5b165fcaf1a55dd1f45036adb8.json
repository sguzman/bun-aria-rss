It’s a privilege to share more of his powerful wisdom with you today.</p><p>Today's conversation is an intimate exploration into the depths of our darkest emotions — shame, grief, sadness and depression — and the lessons they hold.</p><p>We discuss the process of releasing our attachment to ideas and identities that no longer serve us.
