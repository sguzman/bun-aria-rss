  "description": "“You see, this is where a lot of investors get confused...” As today’s first-time guest explains… “The goal in trading isn’t to be right” he says. The goal of investing lies far beyond that… Well, not really. It’s actually pretty simple. All us investors are here for one thing and one thing only - Money. And oddly enough, as most successful investors know, you don’t necessarily have to be right in order to make money.  In some instances, betting against your own will, in trades you don’t even believe in, can give you returns beyond belief. Literally. Which leads me to today’s market...  Currently we’re standing in a relentless, but confusing, bull market. Stocks are expensive and continue to push to record highs… Trump’s pro-growth initiatives are flatlining… and potential bubbles are beginning to steer investors south. Is there still money to be made here? Enter today’s guest, Jared Dillian. Jared is the editor of the Daily Dirtnap, and author of the 10th Man newsletter. Before Jared started writing in 2008, he worked for the Wall Street giant Lehman Brothers - first as an index arbitrage trader and then as head of the ETF trading desk. Jared's \"macro\" investment methodologies brings Wall Street Unplugged listeners a whole new perspective.  Rather than stressing too much on the technicals or fundamentals, Jared mainly focuses on two things: Sentiment & Psychology. In other words, Jared’s known as a behavioral economics expert. “I’m skeptical of everything I read and hear.” And quite frankly, there’s no reason we shouldn’t be either. The fact is, 90% of investors make poor and irrational investment decisions. Market sentiment often swings aggressively… and unfocused, under-the-radar opportunities are left on the table. It’s one of the perks of investing with a contrarian mentality. All thanks to the combination of irrational investment decisions and conventional economics, bear or bull market, these hidden opportunities appear constantly. And on today’s show, Jared shares a few of them...  Tune in as he gives listeners his ideas around Bitcoin, the next potential bubble, and his favorite sector going forward for the year 2017. More important, Jared explains to listeners one of the most underpriced investments to make right now. And the timing of this couldn’t be better. Then, for today’s Educational Segment, I’ll be breaking down a batch of stocks that go by the name of the “Dividend Aristocrats.” These are elite dividend paying S&P 500 companies who have managed to increase their annual dividend for the past 25 years consecutively. Some might sound familiar, while others, you’ve never heard of. The only problem is - nearly all of them have prices that have run up tremendously. And choosing one to invest in is a lot harder than it looks. Join me as I reveal my #1 buy and hold long-term stock from this exclusive list of companies. Good Investing, Frank Curzio",
