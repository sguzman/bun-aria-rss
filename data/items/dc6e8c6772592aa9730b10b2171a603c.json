  "description": "<p>Who are you trusting with your money? We’ve all received some crappy advice at some point in our lives, but when it comes to our personal finances we need to make sure that we’re listening to the right folks. One of the reasons it can be so difficult today is due to social media and entertainment- there are a lot of self-appointed “experts” these days and it can be difficult to tell the difference between sound financial advice and an account or a show that’s meant to just amuse you. For most folks, it might be easier to sniff out a blatant scam where someone is out to swindle you. But potentially even more dangerous- what about the instances of friends or family members who think they’re giving us good advice? Those are situations where they probably have good intentions, but it’s just not the right advice for you. We run the gamut between headlines and social media to financial advisors, and we also discuss how <em>you</em> can determine if the advice you’re hearing is right for you.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Return of the Tripping Dead by Tripping Animals!
