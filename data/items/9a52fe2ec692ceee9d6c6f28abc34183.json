Jenna loved the refining process with her book, which saw it evolve from a business and marketing subject into a book that gets more personal, tackling topics like body image, loneliness, community, and personal intuition. Sharon and Jenna also touch on their shared sense of community living in the same Northern Minnesota city, and how to both tackle life’s challenges one small step at a time and say no when you need to.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
