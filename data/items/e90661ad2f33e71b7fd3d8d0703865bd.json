  "description": "Guest Brandon Hoffman of Intel 471 joins Dave Bittner to share his team's research \"How China’s cybercrime underground is making money off big data\". Through Intel 471’s observation and analysis of open source information and behavior on multiple closed forums, they found actors adopting the use of legitimate big data technology for cybercrime and monetizing the data they obtain on the Chinese-language underground.\nThe behavior Intel 471 analyzed points to a cycle that involves several different layers of cybercriminals, the use of insider information, and unwitting victims in order to earn ill-gotten gains. The schemes themselves proliferate partly due to China’s desire to be a global epicenter in big data analytics, especially as it pushes to become synonymous with new technology sectors like the Internet of Things (IoT). With China injecting big data into every economic sector, the environment has become ripe for criminals to create and execute schemes that hide in the noise brought on by the amount of data at hand.\nThe research can be found here:\nHow China’s cybercrime underground is making money off big data",
