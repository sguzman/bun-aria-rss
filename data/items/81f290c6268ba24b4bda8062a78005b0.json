  "description": "<p>This week the duo are joined by none other than Sarunas Jackson, actor who plays Dro on the hit TV show Insecure. They break the ice with Sarunas by asking questions sent in from the fans and finding out if Sarunas is a fan of booty play or not. In an unfiltered fashion, the ladies ask ALL the questions we all want to know. The conversation continues with role play fantasies and finally gets into dating, and whether having so many preferences can keep you single. How many traits are you willing to pass up on to find your partner? This episode is juicy!
