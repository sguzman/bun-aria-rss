  "description": "<p>At the mouth of Mobile Bay in Alabama sat three forts, Fort Gaines, Fort Powell and Fort Morgan. Fort Powell no longer exists, but both Fort Morgan and Fort Gaines are still here. All of the forts saw action in the Battle of Mobile Bay during the Civil War. Fort Morgan and Fort Gaines would also see action in the Spanish American War and both World Wars. Many people died at these forts and that has lead to stories of apparitions and other paranormal activity. Fort Morgan is considered one of the most haunted locations in Alabama. Today, the forts are historic sites that can be toured and there is even a creepy escape room for adventurous souls. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of the forts of Mobile Bay! The Moment in Oddity was suggested by Mike Streibel and features Exploding Whale Park and This Month in History features Coca-Cola Classic returns.
