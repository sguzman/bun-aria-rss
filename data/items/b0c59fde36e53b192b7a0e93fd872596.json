  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">The church in North America has more money and resources than ever before, so why is it increasingly ineffective? Pastor and author, Jon Tyson, is back to talk about his latest book, “Beautiful Resistance: The Joy of Conviction in a Culture of Compromise.” Tyson says “mammon” is the central idol in America today, and that much of the church worships it as well. But what is mammon? And why does Tyson think prayer and fasting is a path for the church to find real power again? He also shares what happened when his entire family contracted COVID19. Also this week, the crew discusses a Twitter thread about the implications or rooting Christian mission in the Great Commission (Matthew 28) rather than creation (Genesis 1-2), and why resistance to social change is foundational to evangelical theology. Finally, what can we learn from the 10 principles of Catholic social teaching?</p> <p class=\"p1\">Links:</p> <p class=\"p1\"><a href= \"https://twitter.com/drantbradley/status/1285975572414423040\">https://twitter.com/drantbradley/status/1285975572414423040</a></p> <p class=\"p1\"> https://www.americamagazine.org/faith/1998/10/31/10-building-blocks-catholic-social-teaching</p>",
