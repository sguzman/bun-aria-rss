  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys chat about the World Games and all the different events that they've been invested in, what they're excited for in the days to come, and everything else going on in the World Games and who the picks to click are. Later, three different guests join the program to chat about the news that Aaron Rodgers is reportedly on the verge of going back to Green Bay for one last year, potentially on the contingency that Randall Cobb returns to Green Bay as well. Joining the program to chat about the Rodgers situation and all the implications that come with it, alongside everything else that is going on in the NFL right now are Dan Orlovsky (26:18-48:38), Ian Rapoport (48:40-1:01:20), Andrew Brandt (1:15:59-1:30:00), and AJ Hawk (1:01:22-1:30:00).
