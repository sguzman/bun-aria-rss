  "description": "<p>We’re beginning a series looking at the main objections, the main problems, people in our culture have with Christianity. The objection we’re looking at now can be summed up in one word: exclusivity. The problem is this: how can you possibly claim your religion is the only true religion, that you have the one truth? </p>\n<p>Religion, generally speaking, has a very strong tendency to divide people and create strife among people. In fact, I would go so far as to say religion tends to create a slippery slope in the heart that moves all the way down to even oppression and violence. So what do we do about this? We have to do something. </p>\n<p>I would suggest that right now, people are trying to address the divisiveness of religion in two ways. There are two main strategies people are taking, but I’d like to show you they won’t work. Lastly, I’d like to give you a strategy that I think will. </p>\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on September 24, 2006. Series: The Trouble with Christianity: Why It's So Hard to Believe it. Scripture: 1 John 4:1-10.</p>\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.
