  "description": "<p><em><strong>Understanding the Bible: Part Three</strong></em>. This episode we continue our conversation on the complex and often confusing text, <strong>the Bible</strong>. Today, author / professor / biblical scholar, <strong>Dr. Amy-Jill Levine</strong> joins us once again to offer her thoughts and insights. How did the Old Testament come together? How does it inform the New Testament? How does the Jewish <a href=\"https://www.jewishvirtuallibrary.org/the-tanakh-full-text\">Tanakh</a> differ from the Old Testament? How do their individual canonical orders differ and what does that say? What does the Bible, and God, say about women and their role in authoritative and leadership positions within the church? What are we to do with all of this??? AJ, a self described ‘Yankee Jewish feminist,’ is University Professor of New Testament and Jewish Studies.</p>\n<p>As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
