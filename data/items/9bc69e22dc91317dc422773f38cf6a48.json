  "description": "<p>On Episode 357 of Spittin’ Chiclets, the guys are joined by Tom Martin and Brady Skjei. Tom or “bussey” joined the show (1:24:13) to talk about his NHL career, tell some hilarious stories, and discuss the time he was traded for a bus. But first, the guys open the show talking about the awful start of the Chicago Blackhawks. Is it the Players? Coaches? the GM? the guys broke it all down. The boys also touch on the craziness happening up north in Canada. Both the Habs and Leafs are off to tough starts, so the guys broke it all down. The fellas wrap up with a Brady Skjei interview (2:53:14) to talk Hurricanes, Golf, and living in NYC.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
