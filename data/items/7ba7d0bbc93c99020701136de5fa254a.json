  "description": "<p>We introduce a method to construct closed rigid (unobstructed) associatives\nin the twisted connected sum $G_2$-manifolds [Kov03, KL11, CHNP15]. The method\nis based on gluing asymptotically cylindrical (ACyl) associatives in ACyl\n$G_2$-manifolds under a hypothesis which can be interpreted as a transverse\nLagrangian intersection condition. This is analogous to the gluing theorem for\n$G_2$-instantons introduced in [SW15]. We rewrite the hypothesis for ACyl\nassociatives obtained from ACyl holomorphic curves or ACyl special Lagrangian\n$3$-folds in ACyl Calabi-Yau $3$-folds. This helps us to construct many new\nassociatives which are diffeomorphic to $S^3$, $\\mathbf R \\mathbf P^3$ or\n$\\mathbf R \\mathbf P^3\\# \\mathbf R \\mathbf P^3$. We also study the deformation\ntheory of ACyl associatives and define their moduli space with a natural\ntopology and prove that the moduli space is locally homeomorphic to the zero\nset of a smooth map between two finite dimensional spaces.\n</p>",
