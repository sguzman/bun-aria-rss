  "description": "<div>Did you know that a third building fell on September 11th of 2001? If this is news to you, you are in for a rude awakening that just might change the way that you view that “terrorist” event.<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>Evidence of the controlled demolition of that building is everywhere if one has the eyes to see and the ears to hear. However, we know that cognitive dissonance starts to play a part in suppressing this truth because to understand that this building was rigged well in advance is to realize that the official story is a lie. And if the official story of 9/11 was a lie, then that means that the wars were started under false pretenses. A slippery slope, but one that must be examined.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Sponsors</strong><br>\nDelete Me: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2yxo48w\">https://bit.ly/2yxo48w</a>\n</div>\n<div>Cash Advance: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2XVWsog\">https://bit.ly/2XVWsog</a><br>\nFiverr: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/2KpYkO0\">https://bit.ly/2KpYkO0</a><br>\n<br>\n<strong>Online Connection</strong>\n</div>\n<div>Website: <a href=\"http://www.theoctopusofglobalcontrol.com/\">www.theoctopusofglobalcontrol.com</a>\n</div>\n<div>Facebook: <a href=\"http://www.facebook.com/theoctopusofglobalcontrol\">www.facebook.com/theoctopusofglobalcontrol</a><br>\nTwitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/macroaggressio3\">www.twitter.com/macroaggressio3</a><br>\nTwitter Handle: @macroaggressio3<br>\nYouTube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCn3GlVLKZtTkhLJkiuG7a-Q\">www.youtube.com/channel/UCn3GlVLKZtTkhLJkiuG7a-Q</a><br>\nApple Podcasts: <a href=\"https://apple.co/2LjTwu5\">https://apple.co/2LjTwu5</a><br>\n<br>\n<strong>Purchase \"The Octopus Of Global Control\"<br>\n</strong>Amazon:<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3aEFFcr\">https://amzn.to/3aEFFcr</a><br>\nBarnes & Noble: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/39vdKeQ\">https://bit.ly/39vdKeQ</a> </div>\n",
