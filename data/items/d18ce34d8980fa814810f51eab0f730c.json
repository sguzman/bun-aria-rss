  "description": "<p>This week’s Alpha Trader podcast features hosts Aaron Task and Stephen Alpher speaking with Jon Markman, president and founder of Markman Capital, and Greg King, CEO and founder of Osprey Funds.\nMarkman (who previously appeared on Alpha Trader in October) continues to believe the Fed ignited what’s going to be a decade-long bull run in stocks with their actions in response to the Covid crisis last year. With the Fed continuing to provide plenty of liquidity to the system, he’s targeting 92K for the Dow (DJI) in the next decade, and 34K on the Nasdaq (COMP).\nTurning to individual names/sectors, Markman is still spying the opportunity in digital transformation, but this time with a twist - it’s old-school energy and auto companies whose business models are changing from nuts and bolts to 0s and 1s. Shareholders of names like Schlumberger (SLB), Baker Hughes (BKR), General Motors (GM), Ford (F), and Volkswagen ([[VLKAF]], [[VWAGY]]) are set to benefit in a big way. And the massive investment the auto players are making into EVs means a re-rating not just for them, but suppliers like Magna International (MGA), NXP Semiconductor (NXPI), and Analog Devices (ADI).\nMarkman’s got plenty more digital transformation ideas, including a speculative play on cryptocurrencies, and that’s VPC Impact Acquisition (VIH), a SPAC that earlier this year inked a deal to take digital asset marketplace Bakkt Holdings public.\nNext up is Greg King, whose Osprey Bitcoin Trust (OBTC) recently launched as a lower-cost competitor to the Grayscale Bitcoin Trust (GBTC). A longtime investor in bitcoin (BTC-USD), King isn’t put off by the wild volatility (including a plunge from $53K to $49K right about the time we were speaking). He notes that whenever bitcoin pierces a previous all-time high (as it did late last year by finally climbing past $20K), the average subsequent return is 900% - this bull move has plenty more to run.\n“Not your key, not your coins,” is something the hodlers like to say, but King says we all have limitations - not everyone is in a position to start up an account with an online exchange and possibly even custody their own bitcoin. A trust such as Osprey offers a fee of just 0.49%, is something that can be purchased inside an existing brokerage or retirement account, and safety isn’t an issue as all the Trust’s coins are held in custody by Fidelity.</p>\n\n<p>Learn more about your ad choices.
