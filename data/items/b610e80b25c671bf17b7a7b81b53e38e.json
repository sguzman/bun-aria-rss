  "description": "<p>Things are changing so quickly. Last week, we recorded a normal episode … a few days later and we are preparing for a lock-down. As Brits, we tend towards the \"keep calm and carry on\"' wartime spirit, and yet we are also human. So we feel anxiety, and stress about lost income, and worry about relatives, and wonder if we will ever again be able to buy toilet roll and pasta…. BUT, there are also reframes here; there are ways to look at the positives as well as the negatives; there are ways to manage our emotions; there are options.<br>\n<br>\nWe don't have answers. We have no expertise. We just wanted to talk to each other, to connect, to share, to console and to giggle, and we thought you might like to listen in. Hence this bonus episode. Stay safe … but more than that, stay calm and keep a sense of perspective. We can live without pasta!<br>\n<br>\nAlso please join us on the #artjuicekitchendrawerchallenge (catchy, I know!) by sharing your before and after!</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>Louise's Your Art Tribe membership site: <a href=\"https://thispaintinglife.mykajabi.com/art-tribe?preview_token=BAh7CDoMdXNlcl9pZEkiCjYyMDQ1BjoGRUY6D2V4cGlyZXNfYXRVOiBBY3RpdmVTdXBwb3J0OjpUaW1lV2l0aFpvbmVbCEl1OglUaW1lDdEJHsCQtFs3CToJem9uZUkiCFVUQwY7BkY6DW5hbm9fbnVtaQGLOg1uYW5vX2RlbmkGOg1zdWJtaWNybyIHE5BJIg5FZGluYnVyZ2gGOwZUQAs6EnN1cGVyX3VzZXJfaWQw--7aa64a4b19ffa2b3333a9e396432d295137192b2\">https://thispaintinglife.mykajabi.com/art-tribe</a></p>\n<p><strong>Sign up for our newsletters at:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\">bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</a></p>\n<p>Buy us a coffee at: <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\">https://ko-fi.com/artjuice</a></p>\n<p><strong>Follow us on Instagram:</strong></p>\n<p>Follow Alice on Instagram <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com@alicesheridanstudio/\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p>or Louise <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong><em>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</em></p>\n",
