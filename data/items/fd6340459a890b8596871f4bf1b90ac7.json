Watch these show up in Musk’s Twitter playbook.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Musk’s celebrity status is well known. He <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">has</a> 113.6 million Twitter followers at the time of publication. The Teal Mango <a href=\"https://www.thetealmango.com/featured/most-famous-persons-in-the-world/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">ranks</a> him as the third best-known person in the world. <em>Forbes </em><a href=\"https://www.forbes.com/billionaires/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">lists</a> him as the richest person in the world.</p>\n\n\n\n<figure class=\"wp-block-image size-full\"><img loading=\"lazy\" width=\"4181\" height=\"2787\" src=\"https://www.aei.org/wp-content/uploads/2022/11/Another-Elon-Musk-Photo.jpg?x91208\" alt=\"\" class=\"wp-image-1008664586\"/><figcaption>via Reuters</figcaption></figure>\n\n\n\n<p>Critics reacted swiftly and aggressively to his purchase of Twitter. One anti-Musker <a href=\"https://twitter.com/Otto_English/status/1585892142660083713\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">predicted</a> that there will be “a rush of left leaning people to other platforms,” once the right come “crawling back.” <em>New York Times</em> editorial board member Greg Bensinger <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/2022/04/25/opinion/editorials/twitter-elon-musk.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">wrote</a> that “Twitter under Elon Musk will be a scary place.” CBS’s Norah O’Donnell <a href=\"https://www.nationalreview.com/corner/the-bad-ugly-and-ignorant-reactions-to-elon-musks-purchase-of-twitter/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">said</a> Musk might “make Twitter a haven for disinformation and hate speech” and claimed that Musk has used Twitter to bully critics and reporters. Some tweeters <a href=\"https://twitter.com/HSouthwellFE/status/1585880826725556225\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">encouraged</a> people to <a href=\"https://mashable.com/article/elon-musk-twitter-reactions-takeover\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">sabotage</a> Twitter. Perhaps these Musk critics are following through, as Twitter users are <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/twitter-is-drafting-broad-job-cuts-days-after-elon-musks-takeover-11667143301?mod=trending_now_news_3\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">reporting</a> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/TaylorLorenz/status/1585838262173675520\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">significant</a> increases in hateful and racist comments despite there being <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1586149451348910081\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">no changes</a> in Twitter’s content moderation policies.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The European Union also reacted. When Musk <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1585841080431321088\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">tweeted</a> on October 27th that “the bird is freed,” EU Commissioner Thierry Breton <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThierryBreton/status/1585902196864045056\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">responded</a> the next day, “In Europe, the bird will fly by our rules.” Perhaps the commissioner wasn’t serious, as his tweet is a non sequitur: Musk’s freed-bird tweet coincided with his <a href=\"https://www.cnn.com/2022/10/27/tech/elon-musk-twitter\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">clearing</a> of Twitter’s executive suites. He didn’t assert that government rules will be broken.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Musk’s critics appear to be afraid that his Twitter will allow others to have freedom of speech. Actually, the critics should embrace such freedom, as it is <a href=\"https://www.aei.org/technology-and-innovation/free-expression-in-the-digital-age-highlights-from-an-expert-discussion/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">necessary</a> for <a href=\"https://www.aei.org/events/free-speech-in-the-digital-age-assessing-the-values-and-consequences-of-free-expression/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">fighting</a> the very abuses the critics claim to abhor, identifying truth, and developing strong minds and a robust society. A recent <a href=\"https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S073658532200123X?dgcid=raven_sd_via_email#b0290\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">study</a> adds to the reasons for freeing speech. It found that exposure to misinformation prompts internet users to conduct their own investigations, which, if true, should make them less vulnerable to fallacies. And at least one of the study’s examples of misinformation highlighted just how hard actual misinformation is to identify. One claimed piece of misinformation—“COVID-19 death rates are inflated”—is not only open to multiple interpretations but is also a topic on which <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s10654-021-00787-9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">researchers</a> <a href=\"https://link.springer.com/article/10.1007/s11845-020-02370-9\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">have</a> found wide disparities across countries and over time.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>How might Musk use such attention and controversies in his Twitter playbook? One use will be for marketing. Musk famously <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Power-Play-Tesla-Elon-Century/dp/0385545452/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">spent little</a> on marketing when launching Tesla’s cars because word of mouth and media attention did the work for him. Trump’s campaign <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/story/2016/12/trump-clinton-campaign-fundraising-totals-232400\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">leveraging</a> media attention in 2016 to beat Hillary Clinton while spending far fewer campaign dollars than she did echoes this strategy.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Musk will also create multiple <a href=\"https://thehill.com/opinion/technology/3476968-a-new-twitter-is-a-threat-to-meta-not-to-democracy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">channels</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/elonmusk/status/1587498907336118274\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">financial</a> arrangements. This internal platform diversity will have several consequences, including generating new <a href=\"https://www.aei.org/technology-and-innovation/market-solutions-for-social-media-content-moderation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">opportunities</a> for content creators and diverse communities, both for people with common interests and those who can tolerate an exploration of conflicting views.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Also, watch out for black swan <a href=\"https://www.politico.com/newsletters/digital-future-daily/2022/11/01/elon-drags-twitter-screaming-somewhere-00064480?tab=most-read\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">events</a>. Musk ties his business interests to his beliefs in the importance of the internet, sustainable energy, space exploration, artificial intelligence, and human genetics. Look for Twitter capabilities to show up in his broadband, automotive, and energy businesses—not as social media, but as a machine-to-machine and machine-to-person communications platform that creates and uses data for improved efficiencies and user experiences.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Look for him to transform some elements of the power sector. Tesla is already <a href=\"https://quickelectricity.com/tesla-energy-texas/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">approved</a> to be a retail electricity provider in Texas. A Twitter channel dedicated to drawing data from SpaceX satellites, Twitter users, and Teslas could use artificial intelligence to improve energy use across homes, automobiles, and more.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>If even only a few of my predictions are right, Musk’s Twitter will change social media forever. Books analyzing the development of <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Power-Play-Tesla-Elon-Century/dp/0385545452/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">Tesla</a>, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Liftoff-Desperate-Early-Launched-SpaceX/dp/0062979973/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=&sr=\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">SpaceX</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Founders-Paypal-Entrepreneurs-Shaped-Silicon/dp/1501197266/ref=tmm_hrd_swatch_0?_encoding=UTF8&qid=1667389771&sr=1-1\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">PayPal</a> reveal a person that makes big bets, uses his many mistakes to find the right answers, admires innovation, seeks to dominate industries, and doesn&#8217;t like being told &#8220;no.&#8221; These strategies applied to re-creating Twitter will take the “social” out of social media to create spaces for innovation, shared work, and machine work.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>What could go wrong? Politicians are keenly aware of the <a href=\"https://www.aei.org/technology-and-innovation/big-tech-will-never-be-the-same/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noreferrer noopener\">power</a> of the legacy platforms and might act to protect them.</p>\n\n\n<div class=\"related-items shortcode \"><p><strong>See also:  </strong><a href=\"https://www.aei.org/technology-and-innovation/twitter-should-moderate-communities-not-content/\">Twitter Should Moderate Communities, Not Content</a> | <a href=\"https://www.aei.org/technology-and-innovation/elon-musk-confronts-the-moderators-dilemma-holds-mirror-to-users/\">Elon Musk Confronts the Moderator’s Dilemma and Holds a Mirror to Users</a> | <a href=\"https://www.aei.org/technology-and-innovation/market-solutions-for-social-media-content-moderation/\">Market Solutions for Social Media Content Moderation</a> | <a href=\"https://www.aei.org/technology-and-innovation/big-tech-will-never-be-the-same/\">Big Tech Will Never Be the Same</a></p></div>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.aei.org/technology-and-innovation/the-new-social-media-playbook/\">The New Social Media Playbook</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.aei.org\">American Enterprise Institute - AEI</a>.</p>\n"
