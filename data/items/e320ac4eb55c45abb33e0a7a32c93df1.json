  "description": "Seattle is running the country’s most radical experiment to fix campaign finance. Last year, the city sent every resident $100 that they could donate to the local campaign of their choice. Seattle flooded its election with small donations to try to drown out the influence of big money in politics.

We also come across some talking dogs. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
