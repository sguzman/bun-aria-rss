So on this episode of Black History Year, we're talking about it. With the guidance of environmental sociologist Dr. Dorceta Taylor - who has contributed to the environmental movement for more than 30 years - we'll dig into the connection between racism, economic inequality, and the environment, and the actions we can take NOW to protect ourselves and our future.
