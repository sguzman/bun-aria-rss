  "description": "Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss one of Shakespeare’s greatest tragedies. When three witches prophesy that Macbeth will be king one day, he is not prepared to wait and almost the next day he murders King Duncan as he sleeps, a guest at Macbeth’s castle.  From there we explore their brutal world where few boundaries are distinct – between safe and unsafe, friend and foe, real and unreal, man and beast – until Macbeth too is slaughtered.\n\nThe image above shows Nicol Williamson as Macbeth in a 1983 BBC TV adaptation.\n\nWith:\n\nEmma Smith\nProfessor of Shakespeare Studies at Hertford College, University of Oxford\n\nKiernan Ryan\nEmeritus Professor of English Literature at Royal Holloway, University of London\n\nAnd \n\nDavid Schalkwyk,\nProfessor of Shakespeare Studies and Director of Global Shakespeare at Queen Mary, University of London\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson",
