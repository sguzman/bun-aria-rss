  "description": "Dr. Fauci announces he’s stepping down in December. Fauci’s running scared with Republicans taking control of the House, at minimum, next year. Clay says, \"If there were any justice in the world, Fauci would get charged with crimes... I think he could get charged with crimes.\" Fauci is the most destructive bureaucrat in U.S. history. His \"leadership\" on covid will, in the decades ahead, come to be seen as one of the greatest and most destructive failures in our nation’s history. Clay notes this will be when younger historians are taking a look, and most likely when Fauci, Biden and Trump are no longer with us. Buck says, \"It was a massive failure not to fire Fauci during the Trump administration.\" Former CDC Director Robert Redfield: Covid mandates, lockdowns, shutting down schools was \"a public health mistake.\" Rand Paul joins Clay and Buck to discuss the resignation of Fauci, any future upcoming investigations of the CDC and pandemic response going forward.
