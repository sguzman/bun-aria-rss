  "title": "Ep 275 | Jase Robertson Battles a Bat Invasion in His HOUSE",
  "description": "Jase takes on more than a dozen bats in an epic 48-hour battle, but a tennis racket, Google, a phone call to Missy, and a sheet are no match for the creepy invaders squatting in his house. Phil stops the conversation to pray for a 9-year-old girl who has cancer. And Phil, Jase, and Zach dig into what \"the obedience of faith\" means, what Jesus' death started, what the Gospel is, and the difference between how humans and God approach power.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
