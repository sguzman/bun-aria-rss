  "description": "<p>The guys dig deep into this Coen Bros Academy Award Winner. Is it worth the hype? Watch it and find out. We're sure you'll get that cozy family movie night feeling as Brian and Nate discuss brutal stun gun executions and drug money chasing. They'll also answer your key question about the film, and discuss what Josh Brolin's character is up to in \"No Country for Old Men.\" Spoilers included: Fundamentally, the movie is about the clash of two villains: the romantic, old-school outlaw and the new, pitiless vice of Chigurh. You can also hear what two small things Nate would have changed in this movie -- which is high up on his list. As a bonus, they'll discuss the danger of thinking you're so smart when watching a movie, and then proceed to fall into the trap. (Brian manfully restrained from bringing WB Yeats into the conversation.)</p>\n<p><br />#SASF #StoriesAreSoulFood #NoCountryforOldMen #CoenBros #NDWilson #MovieNight #spoilers</p>",
