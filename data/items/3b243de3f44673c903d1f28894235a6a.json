  "description": "<p>We step into the time machine this week and we look at the cigar industry and how it has changed from 1994 to 2019. We will pull out some old price lists and look at how cigar pricing has changed. We also look at prices from other industries to see if pricing has been consistent.</p>\n<p>We also look at cigars we feel are underpriced. In short, what cigars perform better than their pricing. We look at values in the cigar industry.</p>\n<p>If the first hour we fire up a cigar from David’s vault. The cigar is a 1994 Suerdieck Don Pepe Robusto that was made in Brazil featuring a Brazilian grown Sumatra wrapper. In the second hour we fire up a La Gianna Corona Maduro from The Cigar Authority care package that has been made since ’94.</p>\n<p>The Cigar Authority is a member of the United Podcast Network and is recorded live in front of a studio audience at Studio 21 Podcast Cafe upstairs at Two Guys Smoke Shop in Salem, NH and as always you can find many of the cigars we discuss at <a href='http://www.2guyscigars.com/'>http://www.2GuysCigars.com/</a>.</p>\n",
