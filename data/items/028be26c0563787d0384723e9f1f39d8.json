  "description": "<p>One of the deepest integrative thinkers active today, today's guest is a voice both crucial and integral to this conversation.</p><p>Meet <strong>Charles Eisenstein.</strong></p><p><em>A speaker, writer, and social philosopher focusing on themes of human cultural evolution, economics and consciousness, Charles is the author of several books, including Climate - A New Story, Sacred Economics</em>, <em>The More Beautiful World our Hearts Know is Possible</em>, and <em>The Ascent of Humanity.</em></p><p><em>A graduate of Yale University, where he acquired degrees in both mathematics and philosophy, Charles is a counter-culture intellectual and proponent of alternative political and economic narratives that combine ecology, biology, philosophy & spirituality to challenge our current system.&nbsp;You can find his essays, videos, courses and podcasts at&nbsp;</em>charleseisenstein.org.&nbsp;</p><p><em>Recognizing the delicacy of this moment, I’ve been very careful about who I invite on the show to discuss it.</em></p><p><em>The pandemic has cast a cosmic panic I am not interested in amplifying. Nor do I feel it appropriate to deliver an empty dose of conjectural optimism.</em></p><p><em>I don’t hold myself out as knowing what exactly is happening. I don’t think any of us do.</em></p><p><em>I can’t give you a prediction or a prescription.</em></p><p><em>What I can offer is perception. Some perspective. And a broader aperture to reckon with the many ramifications of this most unusual global event.</em></p><p><em>Last week I devoured a recent essay by Charles entitled The Coronation.</em> I found it to be one of the most insightful and well-considered long reads on how to think expansively about our current moment. It’s a piece that has stayed with me -- and the motivation behind today's exchange.</p><p>In the vein of my exchanges with Dr. Zach Bush, this is a thoughtful and at times metaphysical conversation about completely redefining our definition of normal.</p><p>It's about the potential energy of this shared experience to unite humanity around reinventing society wholesale.&nbsp;</p><p>It’s about asking questions. It’s about challenging the dominant narrative. Taking a hard look at our institutional failures. And the systems that perpetuate them.&nbsp;</p><p>But more than anything, this a conversation about standing in our fear. As we delicately wade through the muddy waters of media calamity, conspiracy theories, and fake news, it's about learning how to listen. How to feel.
