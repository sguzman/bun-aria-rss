  "description": "<p>Another bonus episode has dropped featuring Battles & Banter's very own Codie Eash, who gave a lecture on Union General Alexander Hays & the rise of Anti-Confederate Sentiment. The audio is taken from Codie's lecture of which he gave at the 2019 History Symposium at the Gettysburg National Military Park Visitor Center. This will be a continuation of the \"Battles for Civil War Memory\", which the guys hope to return to soon in a larger, feature-length episode. For now, Codie examines precisely what happened on the day of July 3, 1863 at Gettysburg, how it was remembered by those who observed and participated, and the ways it impacted many veterans' reflections on Gettysburg's status as a site of a United States triumph, as well as a major Rebel defeat. Enjoy!</p>",
