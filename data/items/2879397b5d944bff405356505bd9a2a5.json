  "description": "<p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p>There are many parts of European and American cultures that have intermingled, some quite successfully, but the jury is still out on whether the vitis vinifera and the American vitis species have created something truly special and lasting. In this show, we break down European-American grapevine hybrids – what they are, why they are more important to the conversation today, their history, how they are made and what some of the more popular and more successful grapes are. We wrap with a conversation of the challenges these grapes face and I give my view on what I think the role of hybrids will be in the future.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p> <p><!-- wp:create-block/libsyn-podcasting-block --></p> <div class=\"wp-block-create-block-libsyn-podcasting-block\"> <div class=\"libsyn-shortcode\"> </div> </div> <p><!-- /wp:create-block/libsyn-podcasting-block --></p> <p><!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} --></p> <p class=\"has-text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"> <span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"><img style= \"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/grapebreeding.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"202\" height=\"198\" /><span style= \"font-size: 8pt;\"><em>Photo (c) Cornell College of Agriculture and Life Sciences</em></span></span></p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p> <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p>Here are the show notes:</p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p> <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p><strong>What are hybrids?</strong></p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p> <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p>For wine purposes, hybrids are grapes created by crossing two or more <em>vitis</em> species – the European species of grapevine, Vitis vinifera, with any number of native North American grapes. The goal of hybrids is to select for specific, superior traits in each of the grapes to create something that will yield a great wine that will survive in challenging vineyard conditions. They were specifically created in the 1860s and 1870s to fight the phylloxera epidemic (vine killing root louse that nearly destroyed Europe’s vineyards). French researchers created more than 500 different plants in the 1860s and research continued in the early 1900s. In the end, the preferred solution was using American roots with Vitis vinifera grafts, but the hybrids were quite popular for a few decades.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p> <p><!-- wp:paragraph {\"align\":\"center\"} --></p> <p class=\"has-text-align-center\" style=\"text-align: center;\"> <img style=\"margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto; display: block;\" src=\"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/seyval.jpeg\" alt= \"\" width=\"300\" height=\"400\" /><span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"><span style=\"font-size: 8pt;\"><em>Photo (c) Cornell College of Agriculture and Life Sciences</em></span></span></p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p> <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p>Today, development of hybrids is still quite active at the University of Minnesota and at Cornell University in New York.

They are not very popular, they are not considered fine wine, and I personally don’t enjoy many of them (with big exceptions for the whites that make ice wine, in particular). But in recent years, these grapes have been making more of a mark in the US and the UK and with the rise of climate change, I think these grapes will have a bigger role to play. In addition, people want to make wine and they want to grow things successfully in many different climates. Often, they try to make wines out of Vitis vinifera and fail because of their climate, local diseases and pests, and a bad fit with the European species. I would rather see better wines made from unknown grapes, than people trying to make a product that won’t work.</p> <p><!-- /wp:paragraph --></p> <p><!-- wp:image --></p> <p><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/marfoch.jpeg\" alt=\"\" width=\"247\" height=\"330\" /></p> <p><!-- /wp:image --></p> <p><!-- wp:paragraph --></p> <p>The vine matter for hybrids has improved greatly and given their hardiness -- hybrids made from Vitis labrusca and Vitis riparia can grow anywhere - -and our growing problems with climate change, it is time to give these another look.
