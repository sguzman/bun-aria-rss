With them in mind, doesn’t it seem like those who truly capture our attention have something more than the run-of-the-mill creativity but instead harness some kind of mysterious creative magic? They may even be using the same instruments and devices, but there’s still some indescribable, seemingly undefinable gap between the ordinary and the transcendent.\n\nIn today’s episode, I speak with story experts Brian McDonald and Jesse Bryan and we dive into the difference between art that falls flat and art that cuts to the core of its audience.\n\nThese two guests brought a wealth of creative insight and totally blew me away!!! I left this conversation reeling from the mind blowing creative perspective shifts!! One of my all time favorite episodes!!",
