Shan interviews Krista Williams and Lindsay Simcik from the “Almost 30 Podcast” where Krista shares how her relationship evolved over the years and how she passively let him know that she was ready and waiting for his proposal to come. Shan shares her proposal story and how she was heartbroken when the proposal didn’t come on her original timeline. But that’s just one side of the discussion. To round out the conversation, Shan invites her husband and brother-in-law who share their experience with being pressured to propose.</p>\n<p><br>\nFollow Shan on Instagram: <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://www.instagram.com/shanboody__;!!NUnUjx3wvH5xgA!M7k7awSi2emDvZaELJzxc34963SHJx6NaMIye-JDvFT2yAuRK7dDfqh_tfc8vA%24\">www.instagram.com/shanboody</a><br>\nFollow the Almost 30 Podcast: <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/almost-30/id1148183612__;!!NUnUjx3wvH5xgA!M7k7awSi2emDvZaELJzxc34963SHJx6NaMIye-JDvFT2yAuRK7dDfqigzP14tA%24\">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/almost-30/id1148183612</a><br>\nFollow Krista: <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://www.instagram.com/itskrista__;!!NUnUjx3wvH5xgA!M7k7awSi2emDvZaELJzxc34963SHJx6NaMIye-JDvFT2yAuRK7dDfqhETohuTw%24\">www.instagram.com/itskrista</a><br>\nFollow Lindsey: <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://www.instagram.com/lindseysimcik__;!!NUnUjx3wvH5xgA!M7k7awSi2emDvZaELJzxc34963SHJx6NaMIye-JDvFT2yAuRK7dDfqhVXD5bjw%24\">www.instagram.com/lindseysimcik</a><br>\n<br>\nFollow Jared Brady: <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__http://www.instagram.com/enjoyjaredbrady__;!!NUnUjx3wvH5xgA!M7k7awSi2emDvZaELJzxc34963SHJx6NaMIye-JDvFT2yAuRK7dDfqhp-45N8w%24\">www.instagram.com/enjoyjaredbrady</a><br>\nFollow Enjoy the Podcast: <a href=\"https://urldefense.com/v3/__https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/enjoy-the-podcast/id1526698004__;!!NUnUjx3wvH5xgA!M7k7awSi2emDvZaELJzxc34963SHJx6NaMIye-JDvFT2yAuRK7dDfqgVy-Xs9Q%24\">https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/enjoy-the-podcast/id1526698004</a></p>\n\n",
