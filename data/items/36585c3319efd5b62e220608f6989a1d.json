  "description": "<p>In this paper, we study the charged-particle dynamics under strong magnetic\nfield in a toroidal axi-symmetric geometry. Using modulated Fourier expansions\nof the exact and numerical solutions, the long-term drift motion of the exact\nsolution in toroidal geometry is derived and the error analysis of the\nlarge-stepsize modified Boris algorithm over long time scales is provided.\nNumerical experiments illustrate the theoretical results.\n</p>",
