  "description": "<p>For a large class of operators acting between weighted $\\ell^\\infty$ spaces,\nexact formulas are given for their norms and the norms of their restrictions to\nthe cones of nonnegative sequences; nonnegative, nonincreasing sequences; and\nnonnegative, nondecreasing sequences. The weights involved are arbitrary\nnonnegative sequences and may differ in the domain and codomain spaces. The\nresults are applied to the Ces\\'aro and Copson operators, giving their norms\nand their distances to the identity operator on the whole space and on the\ncones. Simplifications of these formulas are derived in the case of these\noperators acting on power-weighted $\\ell^\\infty$. As an application, best\nconstants are given for inequalities relating the weighted $\\ell^\\infty$ norms\nof the Ces\\'aro and Copson operators both for general weights and for power\nweights.\n</p>",
