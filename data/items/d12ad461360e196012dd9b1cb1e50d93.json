  "description": "The field has expanded, so we're guaranteed to get new playoff teams in 2020. But even beyond that, you can expect more fresh faces to the postseason party this season. Will Brinson is joined by Jared Dubin to break down the most likely teams to make the leap. It wouldn't be an episode with Dubin without bringing up the Cowboys, but they are a legitimate candidate for this list. When you add Tom Brady to the mix, your odds skyrocket, so the Bucs have to be on here as well. But who else? Are there easy answers in the AFC? Could a pair of 2004 1st-round QBs be primed to take advantage of one of the few postseason shots they have left?
