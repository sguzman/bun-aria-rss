  "description": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">At some point, we were going to have to talk about fossils, right? <em>Ravished</em> is the bluestocking book that started it all for Sarah, and an absolute classic for Jen. On the reread, we absolutely loved it, which just goes to show that Amanda Quick (aka Jayne Ann Krentz) is a total legend. We’ll talk about the appeal of big heroes who know what they want and just go for it, about how difficult it is to write two people who genuinely enjoy each other’s company from the jump, about how awesome it is when a heroine is totally down with doing it in a cave, and about the broad appeal of greatcoats. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Our next read along is Uzma Jalaluddin’s <em>Hana Kahn Carries On</em>.

Now she publishes under 3 names: Jayne Ann Krenz (contemporary), Jayne Castle (PNR), and Amanda Quick (historical). She has said, “I am often asked why I use a variety of pen names. The answer is that this way readers always know which of my three worlds they will be entering when they pick up one of my books.”</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The Bluestocking archetype is about a woman who is interested in science and learning in her own right, and is a reference to the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://artuk.org/discover/stories/who-were-the-bluestockings\">Bluestocking Society</a>, which was founded in the 1750s by Elizabeth Montagu and Elizabeth Vesey.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Some hallmarks of a&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.bl.uk/romantics-and-victorians/articles/the-origins-of-the-gothic\">gothic novel</a>&nbsp;are “the discovery of mysterious elements of antiquity” and also&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.jacketscreator.com/wp-content/uploads/2019/04/tom-hardy-taboo-coat.jpg\">handsome men in great coats.&nbsp;</a></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">All about the&nbsp;<a href=\"https://pianistmusings.com/2019/05/10/the-scandalous-history-of-the-waltz/\">waltz and why it was so scandalous</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><a href=\"https://twitter.com/JenReadsRomance/status/1175892103727128580?s=20\">Jen’s thread about fossils</a>, which are just&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.writingclasses.com/toolbox/articles/what-is-a-mcguffin\">a McGuffin</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Maybe you are more interested than Jen and would like to learn about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.popularmechanics.com/science/archaeology/g3051/fake-fossils/\">how to fake a fossil.&nbsp;</a></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Author&nbsp;<a href=\"https://vanessariley.com\">Vanessa Riley</a>&nbsp;is committed to reviving bananas regency names for men.&nbsp;<a href=\"https://amzn.to/3ld7hNO\">In A Duke, The Lady, and a Baby</a>, the hero’s name is Busick.</p>",
