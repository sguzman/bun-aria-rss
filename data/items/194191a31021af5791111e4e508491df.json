  "description": "<p>Magnetic Resonance Imaging (MRI) is the most commonly used non-intrusive\ntechnique for medical image acquisition. Brain tumor segmentation is the\nprocess of algorithmically identifying tumors in brain MRI scans. While many\napproaches have been proposed in the literature for brain tumor segmentation,\nthis paper proposes a lightweight implementation of U-Net. Apart from providing\nreal-time segmentation of MRI scans, the proposed architecture does not need\nlarge amount of data to train the proposed lightweight U-Net. Moreover, no\nadditional data augmentation step is required. The lightweight U-Net shows very\npromising results on BITE dataset and it achieves a mean\nintersection-over-union (IoU) of 89% while outperforming the standard benchmark\nalgorithms. Additionally, this work demonstrates an effective use of the three\nperspective planes, instead of the original three-dimensional volumetric\nimages, for simplified brain tumor segmentation.\n</p>",
