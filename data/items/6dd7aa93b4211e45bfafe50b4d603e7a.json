  "title": "57 - The Butcher of Rostov: Serial Killer Andrei Chikatilo",
  "description": "<p>We go REAL dark this week on Timesuck with an examination of Russian serial killer and relentless sadist Andrei Chikatilo, a monster who killed between 53-56 men, women, and mostly children between 1978 and 1990 in Southeastern Russia in horrific eye-removing fashion. I also delve into the psychological reasons we are interested in serial killers. Why is true crime so popular? Why do we love it? Turns it out it's totally mentally healthy to be fascinated with this nonsense. So enjoy guilt-free!</p>\n<p>This Timesuck is brought to you by by the socially conscious on-line fantastic mattress store LEESA!
