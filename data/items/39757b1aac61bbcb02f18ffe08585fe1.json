  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Zach aims to pull the alpha out of everyone around him, including his children. Zach’s young son, Landon, joins him today to discuss a few life lessons he’s learned as of late. Landon recently faced his fears and got on stage at his dad’s live event, Alpha Underdog Empowerment. He says that while he was scared, he did it anyway, and it felt great. He’s already looking forward to his chance to do it again. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">With big dreams of owning his own golf cart, 4-wheeler, dirt bike, or side by side, Landon has been working on saving his money rather than spending it as soon as he gets it. With almost $200 in the bank, Landon’s dad will match his earnings once he reaches $500. One thing is for sure, after a recent golf cart crash, Landon will be operating whatever he decides to purchase with caution. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Having watched his father work hard to get their dream home, Landon hopes to follow in his dad’s footsteps. He’s ready to work hard to make his dreams come true, and aspires to have his own podcast or YouTube channel someday. </span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>What You’ll Learn:</strong></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">What Landon learned from getting up on stage. </span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">What Landon is saving up his money to buy.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Who Landon’s favorite YouTube stars are.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">And much more!!</span></li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><strong>Favorite Quote:</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“I’m glad my dad worked hard for this house because he’s a really good dad.” - Landon Babcock</span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>How to Get Involved:</strong></p> <p> </p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get podcasting help</span> <a href=\"https://podcastpowertrain.com/\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p> <p> </p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more on</span> <a href= \"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ep-310-sneaky-good-marketing-strategies-with-rich-schefren/id1373572178?i=1000546792970\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how to grow your business</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, check out this episode. </span></p> <p><br /> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you enjoyed this episode, head over and visit us on</span> <a href= \"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apple</span></a> <span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Podcasts – leave a review and let us know what you thought!
