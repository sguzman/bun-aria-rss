    "media:description": "Björk never wanted the spotlight. Fame was never the goal, she just wanted to be able to defy the boundaries of pop on her own terms. Debut was where she would burst her way onto MTV and Radio, but with her 1995 album Post she became the innovative and unflinchingly adventurous musician we know today. \n\nHere she would paint from an unrivalled palette of sound: Jazz, Ambient, IDM, Trip Hop, Acid House, Techno and even showtunes. Peppered with dial-tone atmospherics, crushing beats and playful orchestration, it was musically promiscuous, bursting with the full spectrum of emotion, and like nothing the mainstream had encountered before. This is the story of Post: How Björk Reinvigorated Electronic Music.\n\n#bjork  #90s  #MusicDocumentary\n\nFact-checking by Serenity Autumn.\n\nSoundtrack\nLuar - Citrine (https://soundcloud.com/luarbeats)\nJesse Gallagher - The Golden Present\nLuar - Anchor (https://soundcloud.com/luarbeats)\n\n00:00 Introduction\n01:15 Björk - An Introduction\n07:26 The Writing of \"Army of Me\"\n10:02 The Multiple Genres and Collaborators of Post\n16:48 The Lyrical Themes of Post\n22:01 The Aftermath of Post\n\nYou can also follow me here:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TrashTheory\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TrashTheoryYT\n\nOr support me on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/TrashTheory",
