  "description": "We have over-complicated health and wellness. And we may be emphasizing food and exercise too much when stress, touch and sex are just as important. Dr. Rangan Chatterjee knows that people are needlessly suffering, and change is quite possible. Not only is it possible, but it may be much simpler than most people realize. On this episode of Conversations with Tom, Rangan and Tom Bilyeu discuss how crucially important human touch is, and talk extensively about how harmful stress is. Dr. Chatterjee even claims that stress is a bigger part of digestive disorders than food is. This is not the only controversial claim he makes, but he has both the research and the life experience treating patients to back up what he says. After watching this episode you may very well conclude that it’s the simple things that we need to get right: human touch, intimacy, and relaxation. The complexity and the tech can wait.
