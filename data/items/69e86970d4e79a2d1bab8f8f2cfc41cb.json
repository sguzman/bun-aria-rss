  "description": "Uncle Si is a Louisiana legend, but he's got some competition from the Loch Ness Bass of Toledo Bend. Major League Fishing pro Jacob Wheeler drops by and reveals the craziest thing he's ever caught (and why he had to call the police after he reeled it in). Johnny D is stunned by what the professional angler catches with his $500 lure. Wheeler shares the story of the one that got away — the infamous Big Ed. Si introduces Wheeler to the joys of mustard fried crappie. The boys weigh in on what bait they'd use if they were limited to just one. Martin gets Wheeler to tell the embarrassing story of how his boat almost made an escape on the interstate. The boys try to settle the corks vs. bobbers debate. And Wheeler breaks some BIG personal news.\n-\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
