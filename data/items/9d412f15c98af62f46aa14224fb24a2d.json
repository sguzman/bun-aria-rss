  "description": "<p>On today's show, the guys welcome the newest employee at PMI, Mike Mansury. They learn more about his backstory, where he came from, why he wanted to come here, and what he's bringing to the table. They also discuss Tony's bachelor party weekend, whether or not there are actually birds in Italy, if The Rock has the acting range to play Willy Wonka, the news that Avatar 2 (and 3, 4, 5) are dead. They also decide what the best item to get from an ice cream truck is, what the two best smells are, and what two groups of vicious, deadly beasts they'd like protecting them if animals were coming to kill them. Plus the boys get a dynamite drop in from The Boobz Brother from Down Under. Don't forget to send in your questions or anything you want included in the Pod Fod to @ThePodPMI on Twitter/Instagram. Stay safe out there, and enjoy.</p>\n",
