  "description": "Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the rise of the Sikh Empire at the end of the 18th Century under Ranjit Singh, pictured above, who unified most of the Sikh kingdoms following the decline of the Mughal Empire. He became Maharaja of the Punjab at Lahore in 1801, capturing Amritsar the following year. His empire flourished until 1839, after which a decade of unrest ended with the British annexation. At its peak, the Empire covered the Punjab and stretched from the Khyber Pass in the west to the edge of Tibet in the east, up to Kashmir and down to Mithankot on the Indus River. Ranjit Singh is still remembered as \"The Lion of the Punjab.\"\n\nWith \n\nGurharpal Singh\nProfessor in Inter-Religious Relations and Development at SOAS, University of London\n\nChandrika Kaul\nLecturer in Modern History at the University of St Andrews\n\nAnd\n\nSusan Stronge\nSenior Curator in the Asian Department of the Victoria and Albert Museum\n\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson.",
