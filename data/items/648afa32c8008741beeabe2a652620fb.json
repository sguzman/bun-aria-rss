  "description": "The Internet, a place where you can be whoever you want to be, whether it’s your true identity or an alter ego you’ve made up. For some people, this is chatting in online rooms with different screennames pretending to be their favorite character or someone they admire. In 2005 for a man named Thomas Montgomery it was darker than that. Thomas Montgomery was 46 years old when an 18-year-old under the screenname “TallHotBlond” messaged him. Instead of revealing who he truly was, Thomas pretended to be an 18-year-old marine named Tommy and the pair started their online affair. Eventually, their affair would leave someone dead and leave everyone else untangling a web of lies.<br>\n<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Talhotblond-Thomas-Montgomery/dp/B0030949FU\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.amazon.com/Talhotblond-Thomas-Montgomery/dp/B0030949FU</a><br>\n<br>\nAs always, thank you to our sponsors:<br>\n<br>\nSoloStove: Get an extra $10 off the early Black Friday sale at <a href=\"http://solostove.com\" target=\"_blank\">solostove.com</a>, promo code MORBID.<br>\n<br>\nPrettyLitter: Go to <a href=\"http://PrettyLitter.com\" target=\"_blank\">PrettyLitter.com</a> and use promo code morbid for 20% off your first order.<br>\n<br>\nSimpliSafe: Take advantage of SimpliSafe’s early Black Friday deals and get 50% off your new home security system by visiting <a href=\"http://SIMPLISAFE.com/morbid\" target=\"_blank\">SIMPLISAFE.com/morbid</a>.<br>\n<br>\nNortonLifeLock: Save 25% or more off your first year of Norton 360 with LifeLock by going to <a href=\"http://Norton.com/MORBID\" target=\"_blank\">Norton.com/MORBID</a>\n\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
