  "description": "Archaeologists and scholars of the ancient Near East regularly make statements to the effect that there is absolutely no archaeological evidence for many events of the Bible, including Israel’s sojourn in Egypt, the Exodus out of Egypt, and the conquest of cities like Jericho. Textbooks surveying the Hebrew Bible or Old Testament, and books on the history of Israel make the same assertions. Then Egyptologist David Rohl comes along and ignites a revolution in the academic world, arguing that there is indeed much evidence for these same biblical events. In this podcast, well be speaking with David Rohl about his recent book, Exodus: Myth or History? (Thinking Man Media, 2015), along with the companion DVD set of his lectures, The David Rohl Lectures.\nDavid Rohl is an Egyptologist, historian and archaeologist specializing in the historical relationship between pharaonic Egypt and the Bible. He is known principally for his internationally acclaimed television documentary series, Pharaohs and Kings (1995) and In Search of Eden (2001), as well as for his best-selling book, A Test of Time (published in the USA as Pharaohs and Kings: A Biblical Quest).\n\nL. Michael Morales is Professor of Biblical Studies at Greenville Presbyterian Theological Seminary, and the author of The Tabernacle Pre-Figured: Cosmic Mountain Ideology in Genesis and Exodus (Peeters, 2012), and Who Shall Ascend the Mountain of the Lord?: A Biblical Theology of Leviticus (IVP Academic, 2015).
