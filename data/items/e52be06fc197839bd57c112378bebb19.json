  "description": "We all have times where it feels like God went on vacation. But Joel wants to show you how God uses those seasons of silence to get us prepared. When you’re hidden, you won’t see anything happening on the outside, but on the inside God’s doing a work within you. He’s creating an opportunity to grow, to get stronger, and to come up higher. You’re getting prepared to go to new levels.  You may be in a season of silence right now where you feel like you’re hidden, but the silence doesn’t mean God has forgotten about you. He’s heard every prayer; He’s seen every tear. God is not preparing the blessing for you; He’s preparing you for the blessing. As you keep passing the test in the silent seasons, you’ll be prepared and ready to come into more than you can ask or think.<p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
