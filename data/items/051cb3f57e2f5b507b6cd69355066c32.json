We had the opportunity to sit down and capture one of the most interesting stories in Irish Whiskey with Alex Conyngham, co-founder of Slane Irish Whiskey. We talk castles and rock concerts because that’s one big aspect of his history. Then we get into the dynamics of Irish whiskey and if there are commonalities between bourbon like sourcing, regulation, and financing a distillery. Then we discuss the role Brown-Forman plays and how they are trying to appeal to both bourbon and Irish Whiskey consumers.\nShow Notes:\n\nDISCUS hand sanitizer portal:  https://www.distilledspirits.org/distillers-responding-to-covid-19/distilleries-producing-hand-sanitizer/\n\n\nLess than 100 bottles left from 3 different barrels of Pursuit Series left on Seelbachs: https://seelbachs.com/search?q=pursuit\n\n\nThis week’s Above the Char with Fred Minnick talks about drinking bourbon during the COVID-19 pandemic.\n\nWhere did you grow up and how did you get into whiskey?\n\nTell us about your rock concerts.\n\nHow did you decide to do the concerts?\n\nWhat is a good Irish cocktail?\n\nWhere is Slane?\n\nWhat makes Irish whiskey unique?\n\nDo people source Irish whiskey?\n\nWhat is the process?\n\nHow did you decide to start the distillery?\n\nDid you use a consultant to get started?\n\nWhat's glamping?\n\nTell us about your dad.\n\nHow did you finance the distillery?\n\nWhat was it like to work with Brown-Forman?\n\nHow big is the distillery?\n\nWhat age can you sell Irish whiskey?\n\nTell us about the whiskey?\n\nDo you have your own yeast?\n\nWhat's the typical Irish whiskey proof?\n\nHow long are you aging?\n\nTell us about your packaging.\n\nWould bourbon drinkers like Slane Irish whiskey?\n\nTell us about the ultra premium Irish whiskey category.\n\nWhat is the price point?",
