  "description": "Clearly the world has gone, in the words of one Deep State Radio listener nerd, \"nuclear grade bonkers.\"  On this episode of the pod, Rosa Brooks, Kori Schake, Julie Smith, and, host, David Rothkopf discuss the latest examples of this including the departure of the worst and shortest lived communications in White House history (with the best nickname...we won't miss you, Mooch) and they debate the prospects of former Secretary of Homeland Security, General John Kelly to bring order to this White House.  From there the conversation turns to a world in chaos and Rosa tries to wrestle the \"tiara of optimism\" away from Kori as Julie slowly bangs her head on the acoustic foam covered walls of our tiny studio in the third sub-basement of the Ministry of Snark.  Outrage fatigue?  We're not there yet!
