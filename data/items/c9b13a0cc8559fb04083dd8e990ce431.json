Keeping in mind that you want the space to be comfy and inviting, let’s start there. Since there are no defined walls I would suggest you float the furniture. I would recommend getting an area rug that’s big enough to contain all the furniture and ground the space. I would lean towards putting the sectional on the window wall. Then I would have 2 chairs and maybe a small ottoman flanking the sofa to create conversational areas. The ping pong table is a really difficult addition to this space! But you could put it to the far right side of the room. If possible, I would look for a table where you can put a cover or nicer fabric over it that makes it look less “ping pong-y!” To save space I would put some ottomans for seating in this zone that can slide under the table. Regarding window treatments, I wouldn’t cover the windows since you love that natural light. Think of window treatments like eyebrows in that they frame and complete the look. It will give the room a sense of cohesiveness, as well. On those 2 thin windows on either side of the main window, I would hang the curtain rods the same height and use one small panel on each. If you’re worried about baseboard heaters you could use shades, but I don’t think it’s a problem. I prefer floor-length curtains for this space and you could always use tiebacks when you use the heaters. The chandelier is a bit big and formal for the space so if you’re looking to change it, I would personally get rid of it. If you have a choice I would go with recessed lights throughout the space with a few accent lamps, as well. For paint, I always say pick it last. You can certainly go with white, but to make the space feel really cozy I would go with a medium neutral color like a taupe or gray to warm it up. One of my favorites is Repose Gray. Then bring color in with all of your furniture, artwork, accessories, etc.\nWe’re so glad you enjoy the show, Tracy!
