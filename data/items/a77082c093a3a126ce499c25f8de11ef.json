Visit ArborTechTools.com/Zero and use promo code \"Zero\" to get 25% off the best woodcarving tools around.\n\nROUND 1: We’ll say a little prayer for you, sir… MPs handcuff & detain a National Guard chaplain in Kuwait ... for wearing headphones!\n\nROUND 2: If you were dishonorably discharged from the fallout after an assault or suicide attempt there may be hope, the Army is now reviewing its process along with thousands of dishonorable discharges.\n\nROUND 3: Scott O’Grady, the new Assistant SecDef of International Security Affairs, is mad online, sliding in DMs & challenging folks to “say it to his face”. Some might be concerned but I love it. \n\nROUND 4: Mold & leaks & bugs aside there’s another downside to base housing… a neighbor’s porn playing on your AppleTV at 3am...\n\nROUND 5: A new report ranks U.S. Military branches from strong to weak. The results aren't great… it’s totally not you though!\n\nSong at the end is \"Boats and Hoes\" by Prestige Worldwide..</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
