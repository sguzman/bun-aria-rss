  "description": "<p>The Irish Republican Army. Guys and gals who have, since their inception, been viewed as a liberation force by some and a terrorist group by others. They fight for the liberation of Northern Ireland from whom they view as British oppressors. But, as you’ll find out today - their case isn’t so simple. Their cause not obviously just. They’ve been lighting up Northern Ireland and England with bombs and gun fire for damn near 100 years. Why? Does Northern Ireland even need or want liberating? We dig deep into Ireland’s history and the formation and latter evolution of the Irish Republican Army on a boom boom edition, of Timesuck. </p>\n<p><strong>Wanna be a Space Lizard\" Go here:</strong> <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/timesuckpodcast\">https://www.patreon.com/timesuckpodcast</a>  Sign up through Patreon and for $5 a month you get to listen to the Secret Suck, which will drop Thursdays at Noon, PST.
