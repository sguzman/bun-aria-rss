  "description": "Today’s topic is about the ever present question:  New Build or Remodel.  We get a lot of questions about this so we've decided to discuss this subject and help you guys understand what to focus on when considering either option. Cory tells about his DIY remodel and the ongoing challenges he faced and his vote is on a new build.  Sue however, just bought and is in the process of remodeling because she likes the sentimentality and nostalgia that goes into a remodel.   WIth a new build, it gives people the opportunity to start fresh and assures the buyer that everything will work.  While some people love to have a space that contains memories and feel the challenges are worth the trade-off.<br /><br />“When we're starting to work with a client and we're building a new home, we ask them, ‘Do you have anything from your previous home you want us to catalogue and make sure we include?’ And the majority of the time they say, ‘No, we want to start all over.’ And in my heart I kind of sink a little bit because I'm like, ‘Dang it.’ They've obviously invested in pieces, but none of it is important enough. There’s no memory tied to it to bring it to this new house.” 33:09<br /><br />Join our mailing list to see space plans and get exclusive offers:  <br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=HnpGxW\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=HnpGxW</a><br /><br />Cory’s remodel 7:04<br />One of the hard things about a remodel 12:49<br />New Construction 18:35<br /><br />“We've worked with people, often when we're starting to work with a client and we're building a new home, we ask them, ‘Do you have anything from your previous home you want us to catalogue and make sure we include?’ And the majority of the time they say, ‘No, we want to start all over.’ And in my heart I kind of sink a little bit because I'm like, ‘Dang it.’ They've obviously invested in pieces, but none of it is important enough.
