  "description": "<p>Ethiopian cuisine is a D.C. mainstay, so when Ruth and Patrick taste \"fast-casual Ethiopian\" at Union Market, they have questions. What does it mean when a chef tries to put a new spin on dishes that are thousands of years old? We visit a family restaurant that's sticking to tradition, talk to a chef who tried to make the \"Rasika of Ethiopian food,\" and collect some scorching hot takes from perhaps the best-known Ethiopian chef out there, Marcus Samuelsson.
