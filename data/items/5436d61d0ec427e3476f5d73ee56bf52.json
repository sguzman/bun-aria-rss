  "description": "<p>WE ARE SPIRITUAL BEINGS HAVING A PHYSICAL EXPERIENCE. They say that the first seven years of your life shapes you into the person you will become. As many of you know, I grew up Christian Scientist. While it caused me to struggle in some ways, it taught me that the mind is more powerful than the body. From an early age I learned to create intentions to keep me grounded throughout the day. I was also forced (in a good way) to constantly challenge my thought patterns and mentality. For this episode, I’m sharing an interview by an old friend, Rob Murgatroyd, on the Work Hard Play Hard Podcast. Rob asks me some great questions about topics that I don’t usually talk much about. We dove into my religious upbringing and mistakes I made in my youth that led me to where I am today. It’s important to reflect on our past so we can understand our present. Get ready to learn how my childhood has shaped the way I think on Episode 692. Some Questions I Am Asked: How do you think the teachings of Christian Science affected you? (10:20) What did getting caught stealing teach you? (22:18) Where does your radical honesty come from? (25:00) Which teacher has impacted your growth the most? (32:50) What are some new beliefs you have about life? (36:20) What is something you do that people disagree with? (43:30) In This Episode You Will Learn: What I consider my secret sauce (8:46) Where I learned to live intentionally (12:30) The thing a lot of people don’t know about me (14:10) The greatest lesson I’ve ever learned (36:20) Facts about my life that has nothing to do with work (47:50) The one thing I would do if I had unlimited time and money (50:00) All about the upcoming Summit of Greatness (55:00)</p>\n",
