We discuss the state of the black market for both zero-days and stolen data, and get some recommendations for identity protection from the experts. Venafi talks about the implications of the coming SHA-1 expiration, Joe Carrigan from Johns Hopkins tells us what's wrong with public photo-printing kiosks, and some University of Michigan researchers have a clever, insidious hardware backdoor proof-of-concept.",
