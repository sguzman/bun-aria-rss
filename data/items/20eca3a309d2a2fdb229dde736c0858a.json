  "title": "259 - Lady Diana: The People's Princess's Life, Death, and Conspiracies",
  "description": "<p>Let's get royal, Meatsacks! Born a minor aristocrat, Diana Spencer grew up to become one of the most famous people of all time. For years, she was the most photographed person in all of England if not the entire world. The tabloids adored her. Why? She appeared to be the real-life version of possibly the most popular fantasy ever - the fabled princess swept up by Prince Charming!  But her life was no fairy tale. She suffered mental health issues, was married to a man who never loved her, bullied by royal protocol, and relentlessly hounded by the paparazzi from the time she began to date Prince Charles all the way until her untimely death. Today we learn what it means to be a modern, British royal, how the royalty is a far cry from what it once was in the UK, what Diana's life was really like, and we explore conspiracies around her death in a blue-blood, tabloidy edition, of Timesuck. <br /><br />We're donating $15,000 this month to The Wildland Firefighter Foundation.
