  "description": "<p>The Therapy for Black Girls Podcast is a weekly conversation with Dr. Joy Harden Bradford, a licensed Psychologist in Atlanta, Georgia, about all things mental health, personal development, and all the small decisions we can make to become the best possible versions of ourselves.</p>\n<p>If you&rsquo;ve been contemplating working with a therapist, you may have found yourself wondering if working with another Black woman is the best choice for you. There are many many reasons why this is a great choice but there is also a level of vulnerability in working with another sister that catches many by surprise. In this week&rsquo;s episode I&rsquo;m joined again by my friends and colleagues Dr. Joy Beckwith and Dr. Ayanna Abrams, both psychologists in Atlanta, to dig a little deeper into the dynamic that can occur when Black women work with Black women therapists. We discussed some of the joys and challenges of working with Black women therapists, we shared some of our own experiences of working with Black women therapists, and discussed how you can advocate for yourself to ensure you&rsquo;re getting what you need out of therapy.</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<p>Visit our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/shop/therapy4bgirls\">Amazon Store</a>&nbsp;for all the books mentioned on the podcast!</p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Where to Find Dr. Abrams</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ascensionbehavioralhealth.com/\">Website</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/dr_ayanna_a/\">Instagram</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Where to Find Dr. Beckwith</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/askdrjoy/?hl=en\">Instagram</a></p>\n<p>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Stay Connected</strong></p>\n<p>Is there a topic you'd like covered on the podcast?
