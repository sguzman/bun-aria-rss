  "description": "<p><strong>The schizophrenic mother with whom you've never had a great relationship is out of hospital and probably in need of high maintenance care.</strong> You feel guilty for saying so, but just being around her makes you want to leave town and disappear without leaving a forwarding address. Is there a way to ensure she's taken care of without taking on the burden of providing that care, and does it make you a terrible person for even wondering? We'll find answers to this and more here on Feedback Friday!</p>\n<p>And in case you didn't already know it, <strong>Jordan Harbinger</strong> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JordanHarbinger\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@JordanHarbinger</a>) and <strong>Gabriel Mizrahi</strong> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/GabeMizrahi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@GabeMizrahi</a>) banter and take your comments and questions for Feedback Friday right here every week!
