  "description": "<p>Mike Vecchione had me over to the apartment he shares with his partner Dan Soder to talk about his first trip to the Orient. He went to China for two weeks. What happens when you make your first trip to Asia is your mind just about explodes with new stimuli. So I was lucky to get Mike on mic as soon as he got home. </p> <p> </p> <p>Mike is an amazing comic and his new album, <a href= \"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/the-worst-kind-of-thoughtful-live/1421245154\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Worst Kind Of Thoughtful</a>, is out now. </p> <p> </p> <p>I'm going to be in Austin September 19-22 with Adrienne Iapalucci and in Phoenix October 27 with Big Jay, Schaub, Callen, and Theo Von. Go to <a href=\"http://www.arishaffir.com\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">AriShaffir.com</a> for tickets to either show and my November/December European tour.</p> <p> </p> <p>This episode is brought to you by nobody. Enjoy, you worthless commies. </p>",
