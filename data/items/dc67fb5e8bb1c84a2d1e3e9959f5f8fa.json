  "description": "<p>This week we're talking risk, ambiguity and the great unknown. As Louise prepares to teach her annual course, she has been reflecting on the blocks and fears that so many artists experience. Together, we explore our own comfort with risk - where are we willing to leap into the unknown and where do we perhaps hold back a little? What is the difference between growth mindset and fixed mindset? And where can we perhaps push ourselves to take just a little more risk? During our chat, we discuss whether age plays a role in our inhibitions, explore the idea of dancing with fear, and debate the concept of comfort zones and safety.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>Join Louise's free Find Your Joy course here<a href=\"https://anchor.fm/dashboard/episode/e1i6qde/metadata/edit\"> https://www.louisefletchercourses.com/wait-list-fyj-2022</a></p>\n<p>See Alice's latest paintings here. <a href=\"\">https://alicesheridan.com/duality/</a></p>\n<p>See Louise's latest paintings here. <a href=\"\">https://www.louisefletcherart.com/private-view-the-layered-landscape</a></p>\n<p>Find our websites and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/\">www.alicesheridan.com&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicesheridanstudio/\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art/\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p>Credits: \"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n",
