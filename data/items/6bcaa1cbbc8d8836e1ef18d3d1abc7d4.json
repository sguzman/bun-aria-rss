Devonta Smith balled all season and dominated on the biggest stage in the title game, so how high can he go in April? Top 5 is certainly within reach and more likely than not. But how will the competition of Ja'Marr Chase and Jaylen Waddle impact team's decision-making? Brady also breaks down Mac Jones' game and who else from Alabama and Ohio State to monitor through the draft process. Next, Brinson and BQ rank the 8 quarterbacks remaining in the postseason based on their ability to lead their teams' to a Super Bowl victory this season (31:00).
