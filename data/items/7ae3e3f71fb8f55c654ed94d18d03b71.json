  "title": "Working at the White House: Former Intern Chase Woods",
  "description": "This season on Working, we’re going to the White House. For this week's episode, we spoke to someone who was a little less familiar with the institution. Chase Woods, a rising senior at the University of Chicago, served as an intern at the White House this past summer. He talked to us about how he found his way into that role, and what he did during his time there. We spoke to him about everything from his daily decisions about where to eat lunch, to the time he nerded out when he saw Merrick Garland in the hallway. If you've ever wondered about what it's like to be one of the least powerful people at one of the most powerful places on earth, this episode is for you. \nIn a Slate Plus Extra, Woods chats with former Slate intern Ian Philbrick about what it's like to intern in an expensive city full of transitory people.  If you’re a member, enjoy bonus segments and interview transcripts from Working, plus other great podcast exclusives.
