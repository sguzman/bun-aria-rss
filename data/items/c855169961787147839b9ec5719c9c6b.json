  "description": "During the American Civil War, thousands of citizens in the Deep South remained loyal to the United States. Though often overlooked, this small number of individuals possessed broad symbolic importance and occupied an outsized place in the strategic thinking and public discourse of both the Union and the Confederacy. \nIn True Blue: White Unionists in the Deep South during the Civil War and Reconstruction (LSU Press, 2022), Clayton Butler investigates the lives of white Unionists in three Confederate states, revealing who they were, why and how they took their Unionist stand, and what happened to them as a result. He focuses on three Union regiments recruited from the Deep South and explores how Northerners and southerners alike thought about Deep South Unionism throughout the war, often projecting their hopes and apprehensions onto these embattled dissenters.\n﻿Douglas Bell is a writer, teacher, and historian who lives in the Netherlands.
