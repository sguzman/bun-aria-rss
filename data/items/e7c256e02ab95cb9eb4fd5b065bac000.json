  "description": "Mackenzie and Hayden are interns and today is their last day at The Bert Show. Hayden, who’s a senior at Ole Miss University is not happy about leaving and feels like she just started her internship. “It feels like it literally took place within the span of a very long week, and now it’s over, and now I have to go back to being uncool!”\nMackenzie on the hand loves school and is excited to return back to UGA for her last week. “I am excited to go back… we talked last week about how I have a little bit of anxiety about leaving school; I would very much like to stay in school, it’s like my comfort zone, but yea, I’m very excited to start my last year.”\nIn honor of their leaving, The Bert Show asked them to find a beat and write a “Last Day Rap” talking about their experience at The Bert Show.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
