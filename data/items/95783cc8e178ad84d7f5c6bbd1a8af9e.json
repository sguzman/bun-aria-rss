  "description": "16 year-old Enrique Rios and 17 year-old Elijah Moore are friends and attend a construction training program together through their school. Enrique was last seen at his home in Esparto, California on the evening of October 17, 2016. A few weeks later, on November 4, 2016, Elijah vanished after cashing his check at California Check Cashing in Woodland, California. Their families have struggled to get law enforcement and the media interested in their cases. After speaking with their families, we reached out to Derrica Wilson, president of Black and Missing Foundation, for some assistance.   The families have started a tip line.  If you have any information, please call 530-270-9221.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
