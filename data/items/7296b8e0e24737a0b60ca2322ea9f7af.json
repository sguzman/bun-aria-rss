Sarah Livingstone has been my assistant for the last six years and is now moving on. She doesn’t love the spotlight, but I wanted to stretch her by having her as a guest on The School of Greatness.  She says the keys to being a great assistant are thinking three steps ahead of others and believing in the message.<br />\nSo get ready to learn more about Sarah and how The School of Greatness has become what it is today on Episode 821.<br />\nSome Questions I Ask:<br />\nWhat’s been the biggest lesson from the last four years?
