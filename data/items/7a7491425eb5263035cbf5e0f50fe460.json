Long before Mark Zuckerberg renamed Facebook Meta and made an unprecedented pivot into the metaverse, he invented a feature that turned Facebook into a social network behemoth. The News Feed, which put your friends’ status updates onto your homepage, changed how we interact online. It was a strong statement of Zuckerberg’s values: that connecting and sharing at scale would be de-facto good for the world. It was also his first public controversy.
