  "description": "<p>You’ve worked hard for your money, so you should be able to keep every, single, penny. Right?! Well, aside from taxes, you have every legal right to keep your money- however, we’re here to tell you that you would be better off giving a portion of your money away. Whether that means a simple year-end charitable donation or taking the steps to set up a donor advised fund, there is room in your budget to be a giver. And even if you’re not able or willing to set aside a percentage of your income towards giving, you could start with giving away some of your time. Be a volunteer! In this episode we cover the important topics of why you should always be giving money away, some benefits of giving, and then we discuss some practical steps on how you can more effectively start donating your time and money, now!</p><p>At the beginning of this episode we popped open and enjoyed a beer called Consecration by Russian River Brewing Company, a barrel aged sour ale which you can learn all about on Untappd.
