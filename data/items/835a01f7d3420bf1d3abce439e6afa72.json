  "description": "<p>This week, we turn our attention to the ancient art of drawing and in particular to the question of what makes a good drawing. We both often incorporate drawn marks into our abstract work, but what about drawing as an art form in itself, or as a preparation for paintings, or even as a meditative process designed to enrich our lives? In this wide-ranging conversation, we discuss what is meant by the word ‘drawing;’ debate the value of blind or instinctual drawing; and share our own approach to the balance between accuracy and personality. We also consider whether drawing matters at all - is it relevant if you only want to paint abstractly? As usual, we come at this from different perspectives and we hope our discussion sparks some thoughts about what you look for, or want to achieve, from drawing. Maybe it will even inspire you to give it a go!</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>If you'd like to review the 6 steps of the Refresh retreat sessions you can find out more here: <a href=\"https://www.soulrocketstudio.com/refresh\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.soulrocketstudio.com/refresh</a></p>\n<p>Link to Tracey Emin artist talk: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/tv/Ce_mMoKoQZH/\"><u>https://www.instagram.com/tv/Ce_mMoKoQZH/</u></a></p>\n<p>Danny Gregory <a href=\"https://www.dannygregory.com/\"><u>https://www.dannygregory.com/</u></a></p>\n<p>Tommy Kane <a href=\"https://www.tommykane.com/blog\"><u>https://www.tommykane.com/blog</u></a></p>\n<p>Vitamin D: new perspectives in drawing <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Vitamin-New-Perspectives-Drawing-Themes/dp/0714845450\"><u>https://www.amazon.co.uk/Vitamin-New-Perspectives-Drawing-Themes/dp/0714845450</u></a></p>\n<p>Find our websites and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.alicesheridan.com&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicesheridanstudio/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p>Credits: \"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n<p><br></p>\n",
