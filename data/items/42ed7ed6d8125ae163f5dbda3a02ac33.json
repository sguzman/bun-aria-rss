Thoroughly grassroots and populist to the core, it's a category-defying movement that is redefining how we think about and practice fitness by leveraging community, a simple sense of accountability and open public spaces to motivate and encourage people of all ages, shapes, sizes and levels — welcoming everyone from Olympic medalists and professional athletes all the way to complete fitness rookies and recent couch potatoes.</p><p>The idea: use movement to turn strangers into friends&nbsp;and connect everyone to the city in which they live.</p><p>The goal: world domination.</p><p>This week I sit down Brogan — one-half of the beautiful high-energy, charismatic superhero duo that birthed it all — to find out how he did it, and why.</p><p>I was super stoked to meet up with Brogan.
