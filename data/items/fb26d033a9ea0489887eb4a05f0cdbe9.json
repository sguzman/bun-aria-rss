  "description": "<p>The Therapy for Black Girls Podcast is a weekly conversation with Dr. Joy Harden Bradford, a licensed Psychologist in Atlanta, Georgia, about all things mental health, personal development, and all the small decisions we can make to become the best possible versions of ourselves.</p>\n<p>The relationship we have with our therapists is unlike any other we have in our lives. They typically know lots about us while we usually only know a little about them. This is designed so that our emotional safety and needs are prioritized in the space but it can also lead to lots of questions that sometimes go unanswered. Joining me today for another one of our group chat conversations are my friends and colleagues Dr. Ayanna Abrams and Dr. Joy Beckwith, both psychologists in Atlanta, to answer some of the questions you might have about your therapist that you didn’t want to ask. During our conversation we chatted about whether we actually have favorite or funniest clients, how we handle seeing clients out publicly, what it means if you find yourself attracted to your therapist, and whether or not it’s ok to be friends with your therapist after you’re done with therapy. </p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<p>Visit our <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/shop/therapy4bgirls\">Amazon Store</a> for all the books mentioned on the podcast.</p>\n<p>Get updates about <a href=\"https://sisterhoodheals.com/\">Sisterhood Heals</a>. </p>\n<p>Join us for our Minority Mental Health Month programming at <a href=\"https://therapyforblackgirls.com/capes\">therapyforblackgirls.com/capes</a>.</p>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://omny.fm/shows/therapy-for-black-girls/session-250-the-dynamics-of-black-women-working-wi\">group chat conversation</a> where we discussed the dynamics of Black women working with Black women therapists. </p>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://omny.fm/shows/therapy-for-black-girls/post-election-reflections\">group chat conversation</a> where we discussed post 2020 election reflections. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Where to Find Dr. Abrams</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ascensionbehavioralhealth.com/\">Website</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/dr_ayanna_a/\">Instagram</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Where to Find Dr. Beckwith</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/askdrjoy/?hl=en\">Instagram</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Stay Connected</strong></p>\n<p>Is there a topic you'd like covered on the podcast?
