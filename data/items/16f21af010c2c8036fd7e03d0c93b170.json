  "description": "<p>We consider a dual Cheeger constant $\\overline h$ for finite graphs with edge\nweights from an arbitrary real-closed ordered field. We obtain estimates of\n$\\overline h$ in terms of number of vertices in graph. Further, we estimate the\nlargest eigenvalue for the discrete Laplace operator in terms of $\\overline h$\nand show the sharpness of estimates. As an example we consider graphs over\nnon-Archimedean field of the Levi-Civita numbers.\n</p>",
