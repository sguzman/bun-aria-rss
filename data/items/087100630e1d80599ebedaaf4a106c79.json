  "description": "We’ve had a lot of questions lately about hardware. Kitchen hardware, bath hardware, all the different types of hardwares and we felt like we should get an expert in here to sort of break down what makes amazing hardware, so we’ve called on our best buddy, Kirk, who is the provo showroom manager for Mountainland Design, which is a place that sells appliances, hardware, and everything for bath and kitchen. They have locations in Idaho, Utah, Wyoming, and they are the place to buy everything. The supply chain as of late has slowed renovations and construction down a bit, so Kirk tells us about how long it’s taking right now to receive certain items or colors (16 weeks for certain cabinet colors). <br /><br />How far out is hardware? 1:36<br />Hierarchy of knobs 3:54<br />The rule of 7 9:58<br />Light switch hardware 12:20<br />Mixing metals in a chic way 14:51<br />Is brass lasting, or a trend? 18:46<br />Mixing styles 20:42<br />The most timeless color of hardware 23:44<br />Weight, finish, or shape? 26:07<br />Where to splurge 28:45<br />Most interesting pieces Kirk’s ever used 33:02<br /><br />“A living finish is gonna be your bronze, and they’ll go through a patina process to get the different colors. You’ll have your base metals in all these lines, but then you’ll have the patinas, which make them darker, like Rocky Mountain’s brushes and things, but when you’re talking living finish, you’re signing up for something that’s gonna get more beautiful with age. As you touch it, fill it, use it, it’s going to patina and change, and that’s the beauty of it.” 11:46<br /><br /><a href=\"https://mld.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://mld.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
