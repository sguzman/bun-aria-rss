  "title": "Getting Cultural Alignment Right Was the Key To Merger Success for Nova Scotia Nursing Regulator",
  "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/sue-smith-8021028/\">Sue Smith</a> is the CEO and Registrar at the Nova Scotia College of Nursing (NSCN). Doug Bungay is the Senior Director of Legislative Services and Deputy Registrar. They, along with Trilogy Effect founding partners Heather Marasse and Mary Beth Sawicki, discuss the importance of cultural alignment in an organizational merger.</p><p>“We thought the legal aspect of going from two into one was going to be the tricky part, but it became very clear early on that, even though we had two organizations doing nearly identical work, our organizational cultures were different and unique,” explains <a href=\"https://www.nscn.ca/explore-nscn/nscn-team/meet-leadership\">Doug Bungay.</a></p><p>Sue Smith credits the use of the Enneagram framework as the driving force towards the co-creation of the new regulator and a whole new culture. She says, “I would say it was the number one contributor to our success. The Enneagram allowed our team members to learn about themselves and grow professionally and personally. It gave them a tool to develop self-awareness and the self-control needed during a time of tremendous change.”</p><p>NSCN brought Trilogy Effect in early in the process to support the organizational cultural aspects of the merger. Managing Partner <a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/heather-marasse\">Heather Marasse</a> says, “From the beginning of working with NSCN, I was struck by the depth of the commitment of the people. It was something deeper than you might experience working in the corporate world. In nursing, there's a higher calling and the difference is almost palpable. These healthcare professionals are giving their lives to this work. They are passionate and yet at the same time, they bring a certain sense of grace to everything they do.”</p><p>Her partner, <a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/mary-beth-sawicki\">Mary Beth Sawicki</a>, agrees. “NSCN employees were really engaged in the process. It was almost like working with human sponges, who were so appreciative and soaked up everything that we had to teach. This stems from support of leadership. Everyone was encouraged to take part and was supported all along the way.”</p><p>In this podcast episode, Sue and Doug share their own leadership journeys and explain the important role that cultural alignment played in the successful merger of two healthcare regulators. They talk about how the Enneagram transformed their teams, their workplace, and their lives.  </p><p>Links to helpful resources and information about some of the tools and concepts mentioned in the show:</p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/blog/what-is-a-leadership-coach\">What is a Leadership Coach</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/blog/use-enneagram-better-leader\">How to use the Enneagram better to become a leader</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/blog/2017/1/8/what-is-alignment-and-why-does-it-matter-d7r8r\">Alignment and Why It Matters</a></li></ul><p>Please subscribe to the <i>Being Human Is Good for Business Podcast </i>on iTunes, Amazon, Google Podcasts, iHeart Radio and Spotify (links below) or wherever you get your podcasts.
