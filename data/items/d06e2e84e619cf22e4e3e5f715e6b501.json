  "description": "<p>John Caparulo had me over to his palatial estate to do a podcast and we spent most of it talking about poker. Cap was the reason I started playing poker at casinos. He introduced it to Steve Rannazzisi and me about 10 years ago and I caught the bug hard. We had some great times going down to the LA casinos late night after the Comedy Store was over. Hustler, Commerce, Hollywood Park, we hit them all. The last hour was just fun memories. So enjoy. And please enjoy an extra long introduction that has me venting about censorship in comedy.</p>\n<p><em><strong><span style=\"text-decoration: underline;\">Twitter</span></strong></em></p>\n<p>John Caparulo - http://twitter.com/johnCaparulo</p>\n<p>Jamie Caparulo - http://twitter.com/Jamie_Caparulo</p>\n<p>Ari Shaffir - http://twitter.com/AriShaffir</p>",
