  "description": "<p>This week Michael and Steve are joined by Jason Cerbone (Jackie Aprile Jr). Jason talks about what it was like to join the cast of this incredible show and how he was absolutely in awe of the amazing talent on set. He also talks about how he got the news his character would get killed off and how his relationship with the cast grew after he got whacked. </p><p>Michael and Steve also talk about the concept of fame, how it affected them, and how people began to treat them differently after the Sopranos. Then they get into this week’s episode which is a big one. This was the last episode with Nancy Marchand and with her passing the show took a monumental shift. Janice is back in the picture, Ralph is filling the void left by Richie and Tony and Meadow are completely at odds. So how come the entire cast couldn’t stop laughing? It’s all on this week’s episode of Talking Sopranos, Proshai, Livushka S-3 Ep-2. Make sure to subscribe to the Talking Sopranos podcast wherever you get your podcasts and go to talkingsopranos.com to ask Michael and Steve questions, get official merchandise and hear Michael’s original music. </p>\n",
