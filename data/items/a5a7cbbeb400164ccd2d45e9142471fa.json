  "description": "<p>Strap yourself in for one hell of an interview as we chat with two-time Australian Olympic alpine skier Jono Brauer about his amazing career in his amazing sport! We find out just how he got involved in skiing growing up and the challenges that came with doing ski racing in Australia throughout the 1990s and early 2000s. We also find out how he very nearly was a three-time Olympian and how he took the disappointment of not making the Salt Lake team and turned it into a positive. Added to this we learn out just how many surgeries he has had (that he can remember), how hopeful he is for the future of alpine skiing in Australia and just why he could very well be the next James Bond. It's a fun ride that you will want to strap yourself in for! So get to listening! </p>",
