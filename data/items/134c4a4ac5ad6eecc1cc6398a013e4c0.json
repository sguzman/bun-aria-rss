  "description": "<p><p>On this week's edition of ZBT, we recap our experience at the Army-Navy tailgate. Both fanbases showed up big time to the tailgate and it was a lot of fun. We bring on our friend Dave to thank him for making the tailgate possible. We open up the mailbag and take questions about troop morale, bumper stickers., and Jody's, among other things!Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
