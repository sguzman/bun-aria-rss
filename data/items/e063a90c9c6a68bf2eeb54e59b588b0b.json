  "description": "<p>🎉 Happy 100th Episode 🎉</p> <p>Cobie, fka Crypto Cobain, is a cultural staple in the crypto space. Wearing many hats as a narrative investor, thought leader, and memelord, we dive into the brain of one of our favorite crypto characters.</p> <p>Having been in crypto for nearly a decade, Cobie tells us his keys to surviving in crypto and what it takes to last long term. We also dive into how much decentralization matters, roles and responsibilities in shaping the world around us, and his outlook for 2022 and beyond.</p> <p>Cobie advises a healthy dose of skepticism and curiosity, and describes himself as a reality maximalist. He’s gone on an absolute tear recently, dropping a series of excellent thought piece articles that establish mental models for understanding narratives across the ecosystem.</p> <p>We also go through moral alignment charts and ask Cobie the big question… What does he think of Bankless?</p> <p>------<br /> ✨ DEBRIEF ✨ | Ryan & David's Unfiltered Thoughts on the Episode<br /> <a href= \"https://shows.banklesshq.com/p/debrief-cobie\">https://shows.banklesshq.com/p/debrief-cobie</a> </p> <p>------<br /> 📣 ONJUNO | Crypto from your Checking Account!<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/OnJuno\">https://bankless.cc/OnJuno</a> </p> <p>------<br /> 🚀 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER: <a href= \"https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/\">https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/</a> <br />  🎙️ SUBSCRIBE TO PODCAST: <a href= \"http://podcast.banklesshq.com/\">http://podcast.banklesshq.com/</a> </p> <p>------<br /> BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS:</p> <p>⚖️ ARBITRUM | SCALING ETHEREUM<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum\">https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum</a> </p> <p>🍵 MATCHA | SMART ORDER ROUTING<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Matcha\">https://bankless.cc/Matcha</a> </p> <p>🚀 SLINGSHOT | LAYER 2 SOCIAL TRADING<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Slingshot\">https://bankless.cc/Slingshot</a> </p> <p>🏦 GEMINI | TURN FIAT INTO CRYPTO<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Gemini\">https://bankless.cc/Gemini</a> </p> <p>🦁 BRAVE | THE BROWSER NATIVE WALLET<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Brave\">https://bankless.cc/Brave</a> </p> <p>🦄 UNISWAP | DECENTRALIZED FUNDING<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/UniGrants\">https://bankless.cc/UniGrants</a> </p> <p>------<br /> Topics Covered:</p> <p>0:00 Intro<br /> 5:30 How Cobie Survives in Crypto<br /> 13:41 Early Discoveries<br /> 21:22 Reality Maximalism<br /> 32:38 Responsibility & Roles<br /> 43:39 Tribes, Decentralization, Utility<br /> 53:10 Profit Maximalism<br /> 1:01:31 Staking & Incentives<br /> 1:10:42 Wins and Losses<br /> 1:19:20 Crypto Brain & Culture<br /> 1:28:45 Wealth & Purpose<br /> 1:36:18 Chaotic Good & UpOnly<br /> 1:39:58 Judging Others<br /> 1:54:00 Bullish or Bearish in 2022<br /> 2:00:42 Closing & Disclaimers</p> <p>------<br /> Resources:</p> <p>Cobie on Twitter<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/cobie?s=20\">https://twitter.com/cobie?s=20</a> <br />  UpOnly<br /> <a href=\"https://uponly.tv/\">https://uponly.tv/</a> <br /> Cobie’s Newsletter<br /> <a href= \"https://cobie.substack.com/\">https://cobie.substack.com/</a> </p> <p>-----<br /> Not financial or tax advice.
