  "description": "<p>We prove a logarithmic base change theorem for pushforwards of\npluri-canonical bundles and use it to deduce that positivity properties of log\ncanonical divisors descend via smooth projective morphisms. As an application,\nfor a surjective morphism $f:X\\to Y$ with $\\kappa(X)\\ge 0$ and $-K_Y$ big, we\nprove $Y\\setminus \\Delta(f)$ is of log general type, where $\\Delta(f)$ is the\ndiscriminant locus. In particular, when $Y=\\mathbb{P}^n$ we have $\\dim\n\\Delta(f)=n-1$ and $\\mathrm{deg}\\,\\Delta(f)\\ge n+2$, generalizing the case\n$n=1$ proved by Viehweg-Zuo. In addition, we prove Popa's conjecture on the\nsuperadditivity of the logarithmic Kodaira dimension of smooth algebraic fiber\nspaces over bases of dimension at most three and analyze related problems.\n</p>",
