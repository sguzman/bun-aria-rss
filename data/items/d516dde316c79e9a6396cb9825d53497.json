    "media:description": "Decomposition of an operator on a complex vector space. For each operator on a complex vector space, there is a basis of the vector space consisting of generalized eigenvectors of the operator. Multiplicity (also called algebraic multiplicity) and geometry multiplicity of an eigenvalue.  The sum of the multiplicities of the eigenvalues of an operator on V equals dim V.",
