Recorded on the day the Supreme Court made it illegal to fire someone because they are LGBTQ, the three get into legislation that Marti would like to pass if elected, and explain the need to defund the police. Marti details their recent violent and traumatic arrest by the NYPD while they were peacefully protesting police brutality, and it's a must-hear. Also, discussion on Marti's \"culture that made them say culture was for them\": Princess Diana. Strap in, it's a ride, and contains a story about how Marti once said the word \"pussy\" in front of Princess Beatrice. Also: Mulan as queer icon, Kelly Clarkson and how being in quarantine can affect relationships, \"mask performance\", J.K. Rowling dragging. Daniel Radcliffe worshipping, the Real Housewives franchise, and how drag has evolved in the last decade. DEFUND THE POLICE. REMOVE COLUMBUS.
