  "title": "66: The Election of 1864: Lincoln's Bid for Reelection",
  "description": "“Johnson is either drunk or crazy,”\n\nThis is the story of the fight for the presidency in 1864.\n\nNo US President since Andrew Jackson has seen a second term. Few are even nominated by their party for a second term. Will the Republicans choose Abraham Lincoln again? More to the point--will war-weary Americans voters, including moderates who disapprove of Lincoln making the abolition of slavery a war aim, choose Lincoln again? \n\nThe Democrats have a strong candidate: General George B. “Little Mac” McClellan. He might be out of the war, but he’s certainly ready to fight the man who fired him. Welcome to a presidential election amid an actual Civil War.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
