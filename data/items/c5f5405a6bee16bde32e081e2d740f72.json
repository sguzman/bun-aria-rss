  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, the SAT has changed to make college less competitive. Social activists have pushed identity politics even further ahead and the SAT will no longer be based on merit and will now include an adversity score based on social and economic factors. When will we start treating individuals like individuals? Then, Attorney General William Barr continues to correct the record as he looks further into the origins of the Russia Investigation. It appears that Mueller's Office and the media are still colluding as reporters continue their indictments in the court of public opinion since Mueller couldn't bring any charges as there were no offenses. This was likely leaked to shape the narrative of information that will be made public in the forthcoming Inspector General's report. Finally, Shannon Bream calls in to discuss her new book - Finding the Bright Side: The Art of Chasing What Matters.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
