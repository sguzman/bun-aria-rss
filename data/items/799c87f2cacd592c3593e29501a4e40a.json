  "description": "<p>In the mid-20th century, the European philosophy scene became enamored with a little Romanian depressed guy by the name of Emil Cioran. This week, Dan tries his best to get Connor to feel the love for this sad weirdo. Their discussion drifts from <em>Catcher In The Rye</em> to continental philosophy to Cioran's unfortunate history with fascism.
