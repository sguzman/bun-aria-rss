  "description": "<p>In 1948, most US universities were slow to embrace the growing Modernist movement.  Then NC State University brought in a brilliant Dean from Oklahoma who went all-in on Modernism.  Within two years, <strong>Frank Lloyd Wright</strong> and <strong>Richard Neutra</strong> were speaking at the school and students and faculty from all over the world wanted to be there.  He wasn't the greatest architect and only designed a few buildings, but he sure knew how to get NC State's School of Design on the map.  Although he died in 1990, his impact on thousands of careers and tens of thousands of buildings endures. USModernist Radio welcomes former students, old friends, and respected colleagues <strong>Abie Harris, Roger Clark, Ben Taylor, and Jerzy Główczewski</strong> to talk about the man, the myth, the legend, <strong>Henry Kamphoefner.</strong></p>",
