He goes to feed birds at the park, and among the birds is a goose, like a god of the geese, who shrieks with all the emotion stored in him. This goose is like a priest of grief for Martín Espada, voicing the sounds of all that he’s feeling.</p><p><strong>Martín Espada</strong> has published more than twenty books as a poet, editor, essayist and translator.
