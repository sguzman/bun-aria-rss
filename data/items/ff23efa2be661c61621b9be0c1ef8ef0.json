    "media:description": "China is building a $580 billion USD city of the future south of Beijing. Named Xiong’an, the city will help alleviate pressure from Beijing by absorbing its non-essential capital functions. Designed as a green, smart city, it will also hopefully fuel innovation and improve the quality of life of Chinese citizens. The city will cover over 1,000 square kilometers of land in Rongcheng, Xiong and Anxin counties. Eventually, it is hoped Xiong’an will add 298 billion dollars to the region’s GDP and host 1.5 million people. Since construction started in 2017, the project has progressed significantly. A train station, huge neighborhood, schools, and business/citizen service centers are all finished. Many other projects are underway or in planning. In the future, Xiong’an will certainly rise from the rural farmland of northern China. Whether it will succeed and become a world-class smart city, we will just have to wait and see.\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, please consider subscribing to Futurology for more content!\n\nThank you to the following sources!\n\nInformation\nhttps://www.bjreview.com/China/202104/t20210402_800242422.html\nhttps://global.chinadaily.com.cn/a/202105/15/WS609f1133a31024ad0babe06f.html\nhttps://www.brookings.edu/opinions/a-brave-new-world-xis-xiongan/\nhttps://www.globaltimes.cn/page/202106/1227264.shtml\nhttps://tlslandarch.com/portfolio_page/xiongan-new-area/\nhttps://www.china-briefing.com/news/xiongan-new-area-beijing-tianjin-hebei/\nhttps://thecityfix.com/blog/opinions-split-beijings-congestion-charge-many-support-intended-goals-shiyong-qiu/\nhttps://tomorrow.city/a/xiongan-new-area-the-selfsufficient-city\nhttps://www.hitachi.com/rev/archive/2021/r2021_01/pdf/gir.pdf\nhttp://www.xinhuanet.com/english/2021-01/17/c_139674378.htm\nhttps://news.cgtn.com/news/2021-04-01/Chart-of-the-day-The-rise-of-a-future-city-Xiongan-New-Area-Z6wXpqPJwA/index.html\nhttp://english.www.gov.cn/news/photos/202008/15/content_WS5f3749abc6d029c1c2637d1f.html\nhttp://www.xinhuanet.com/english/northamerica/2021-04/09/c_139868598_2.htm\nhttp://www.china.org.cn/china/2019-09/24/content_75240818.htm\nhttps://www.skyscrapercity.com/threads/xiongan-xiongan-new-area-construction.2295400/page-2\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jgmpNoFS6M&t=105s\nhttps://finance.sina.com.cn/stock/stockzmt/2020-04-11/doc-iircuyvh7217964.shtml\nhttps://www.numbeo.com/cost-of-living/city_price_rankings?itemId=100\nhttp://english.scio.gov.cn/topnews/2018-04/23/content_50952897.htm\nhttps://h3re.it/xiongan/\n\nAudio\nStoryblocks\n\nGraphics\nChapman Taylor\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pVeO_IoGB0Q\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=FA-KnLLqcX0\nAutoConceptionTV\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=D2fcYWry0HE\nAlstom\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=rMYuVxV4CnA\nNew China TV\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SfI7gnZwI1E\nCCTV Video News Agency\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wgdaQ1hskBE\nZOOMLION Tech\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=4jgmpNoFS6M\nBarrett\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Z-ftv50D7XI\nPhuketian Mubi\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=qT_IvWKFTRU\nMiyakoshi Holdings, Inc.\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cEXMij6R8YU",
