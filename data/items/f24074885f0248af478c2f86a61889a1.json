  "description": "<p>Miss Molly's Bed and Breakfast has been on the suggestions list for quite a while and we decided to produce it now because our longtime listener and Executive Producer Amy Martinez's daughter recently visited the location and had a chance to investigate. A sign outside one of the rooms reads, \"Street ladies bringing in sailors must pay for room in advance.\" So clearly, this wasn't always a simple little hotel. This was once a brothel and many of the spirits from that time back in the early 1900s are still sticking around the bed and breakfast. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of Miss Molly's Bed and Breakfast! The Moment in Oddity features Yemen's Well of Hell and This Month in History features Lawrence Joel awarded the Medal of Honor. This location was suggested by listener Amy Martinez.</p> <p>This episode is brought to you by Best Fiends.
