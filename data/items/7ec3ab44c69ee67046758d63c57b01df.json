  "description": "<p>Do you find it difficult to keep emotions out of business - especially when you feel let down? Many of us do it, but is it the best way to make decisions? &nbsp;This week we discuss the issue of disappointment and how we deal with it (or don’t!). Our conversation leads into the idea that disappointment is always closely related to expectations - when we expect something specific of a person or situation, we can feel hurt, angry or extremely disappointed when those expectations are not met. &nbsp;We have recently experienced a number of situations where we have either witnessed disappointment, caused disappointment, or felt disappointment and we examine this issue from each of these 3 perspectives. In this episode, we also discuss egotistical gurus, inspiring leaders, and the power of starting the week in creative flow.</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>Kyle Cease<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nDqMhZoEq8\">&nbsp;</a><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nDqMhZoEq8\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=1nDqMhZoEq8</a></p>\n<p>Mahamed Hashi &nbsp;on Four Thought<strong> &nbsp;</strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000ktq6\"><u><strong>https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000ktq6</strong></u></a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Find us and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\">bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</a></p>\n<p>Buy us a coffee at: <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\">https://ko-fi.com/artjuice</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p>Alice <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com@alicesheridanstudio/\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p>Louise <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p><em>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</em></p>\n<p><br></p>\n",
