  "description": "<p>In this week's episode, 2006 Stanley Cup winner and current Uber driver Mike Commodore joins the show and burns the place down. He explains why he can't stand either Mike Babcock or Regis Pierre McGuire and talks about the differences in his two Cup runs (other than the outcomes). The fellas discuss the big collision between Taylor Hall and Philip Larsen then the Columbus Blue Jackets late arrival to the party. The guys also answer #AllRightHamilton questions from listeners. Tune in to also to hear if Ryan or Grinnelli can successfully answer an #AskAMillennial question for a change. Then they turn the tables on RA during #AskAnOldFuck. But Commie is the highlight of this episode so fire it up.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
