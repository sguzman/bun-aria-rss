  "description": "Our mind is like a computer—how it is programmed determines everything. God, your Creator and Programmer, designed you to live an abundant, victorious, faith-filled life where you can do all things through Christ! But the reason we don’t always live this abundant life is because we’ve allowed viruses to contaminate our software and influence our thoughts with things such as our environment, how we were raised, the people we are around, and hurtful situations. This message will teach you how to hit the delete button and get back to your original software. As you take a look inside and examine your thought patterns, you’ll be inspired to upgrade with God’s Word and let go of what no longer serves you. Don’t let your thoughts limit you anymore. Let God’s Word empower you to live a life of victory!<p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
