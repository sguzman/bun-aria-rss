By now he knows at least a little bit about a lot of things.</p>\n<p>Dubner has a friend who’s equally curious and who has also absorbed an enormous amount of information over the course of his eclectic career. <strong><a href=\"http://www.jamesaltucher.com/\">James Altucher</a></strong> is an entrepreneur, investor and author. James also interviews people who intrigue him, for his <em><a href=\"http://www.jamesaltucher.com/category/the-james-altucher-show/\">James Altucher Show</a></em> podcast.</p>\n<p>Not long ago, Dubner and Altucher started a podcast together called <em><a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/question-of-the-day/id1034048768?mt=2\">Question of the Day</a></em>. It’s a continuation of the kind of fast-paced conversation these two smart, unconventional thinkers have been having for years over their long friendship and their long-running game of backgammon.</p>\n<p>The topics are wide-ranging but never superficial, deep but never heavy. The episodes are short — usually under 15 minutes — and full of useful information that’s also  entertaining. In a single episode you might hear about <strong><a href=\"https://psy.fsu.edu/faculty/ericsson.dp.html\">Anders Ericsson</a></strong>’s <a href=\"http://graphics8.nytimes.com/images/blogs/freakonomics/pdf/DeliberatePractice(PsychologicalReview).pdf\">10,000-hour rule</a>, <strong>Steven Spielberg</strong>’s <a href=\"http://www.nytimes.com/1999/02/14/magazine/steven-the-good.html?pagewanted=all\">singular advice</a> about casting a movie and why the key to a good golf game is leg strength. All that from asking the question “<a href=\"http://www.earwolf.com/episode/shortcuts-from-the-stars/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">What are shortcuts to learning something quickly?</a>”</p>\n<p>You can imagine the twists and turns when they ask <a href=\"http://www.earwolf.com/episode/what-are-the-secrets-of-being-likable/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">“What are the secrets of being likable?</a>” “<a href=\"http://www.earwolf.com/episode/should-you-let-kids-win-at-chess/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Should you let your kids win at chess?</a>” or “<a href=\"http://www.earwolf.com/episode/james-altucher-bionic-man/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">What is the best possible future discovery or invention?</a>”</p>\n<p>It’s a safe bet that in no other podcast will you hear references to the business savvy of YouTube make-up artist sensation <strong>Michelle Phan</strong>, the improbable story of how a podcasting start-up called Odeo morphed into Twitter, and the writing habits of <strong>Stephen King</strong>.</p>\n<p>We like to say that <em>QOD</em> is for people who are long on curiosity and short on time. We’re guessing anyone who’s a fan of Freakonomics would fit into that category. So check out <em>Question of the Day</em>. You can subscribe to it on <a href=\"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/question-of-the-day/id1034048768?mt=2\">iTunes</a> and also hear it on <a href=\"http://www.earwolf.com/show/question-of-the-day/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Earwolf</a>, <a href=\"https://soundcloud.com/question-of-the-day\">Soundcloud</a> and <a href=\"http://www.stitcher.com/podcast/question-of-the-day\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stitcher</a>. And you can follow <em>QOD</em> on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/qod\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/qodpodcast/\">Facebook</a>.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://freakonomics.com/2015/11/introducing-question-of-the-day-a-new-dubner-podcast/\">Introducing &#8220;Question of the Day,&#8221; a New Dubner Podcast</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://freakonomics.com\">Freakonomics</a>.</p>\n"
