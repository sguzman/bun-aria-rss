    "media:description": "My NEW film simulation presets are 40% off! https://theartofphotography.tv/presets/\n\nI've been shooting on the Canon EOS R7 for about a month. I think its probably my favorite option for an APS-C camera on the market right now. Canon have really done a nice job on this. The Sony a6600 and Fujifilm X-T4 are really nice options as well, but I think when you factor in the features vs price point - the R7 is tough to beat.
