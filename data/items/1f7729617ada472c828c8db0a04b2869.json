  "description": "<p>Why does it concern psychologists that the Texas GOP platform recently opposed the teaching of critical thinking?  Most of us have been told since we were very young that critical thinking is very important.  Psychologists certainly agree and a lot of time spent in most psychology classes is spent learning how to think critically.  Why is it such a central part of our classes?  And here's a kicker: it might be a lot harder to teach it than we had hoped.  Find out why critical thinking is so central to psychology.  Sounds kinda dry?  I think you'll find this a lot of fun (in a mental kind of way…).</p>",
