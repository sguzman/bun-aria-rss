  "description": "<p>HERE WE GO! Round 2 of the Twitter debate. This time Joe brought on Tim Pool, a journalist that has very strong opinions about what Twitter is doing, and Vijaya Gadde the Twitter lawyer. Their conversation was a pretty intense 3 hour event and starts to paint a more clear picture of whatâ€™s going on over at Twitter. This is basically a freedom of speech conversation in regards to social media. Enjoy!</p>\n <p>Enjoy my review folks!</p>\n <p>Please email me with any suggestions and questions for future Reviews:</p>\n <p>Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com</p>\n",
