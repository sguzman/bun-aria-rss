  "description": "This week on the Colin and Samir podcast we talk about a day that we never expected would come. We recorded this episode on Colin’s 30th birthday. Colin and I met when we were 22 and have been working together ever since. Our twenties were filled with experimentation, successes, failures and a lot of adventures along the way. On this episode, we reflect on the past 10 years, the work we’ve done together and the decisions that defined the decade for Colin. \nThere were a few unexpected moments in the episode - we had a brief weather interruption and a phone call from Colin's mom that we recorded, and decided to include an abridged version towards the end of the episode. \nEnjoy our conversation and sign up for our newsletter at Colinandsamir.com",
