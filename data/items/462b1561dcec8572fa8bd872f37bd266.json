  "description": "Stay tuned for the last 15 minutes of the show for a very thorough look at the Cowboys-Saints game. But first, we'll give you the news and notes and take a look at some of the interesting trends we've seen through the first 12 weeks of the season. At RB (10:00), which players were able to emerge from the \"Dead Zone\" and what did we learn about our ability to evaluate stud RBs? At WR (18:00), is this year that much different than previous season? And at TE (27:30), we see once again how important target share is ... It's Trustometer time! We evaluate the Bucs (31:00) and Cowboys (36:10) passing games as the key pieces get healthy. Plus, is it time to sit D.K. Metcalf (40:40)? And thoughts on players like Kyle Pitts, Ja'Marr Chase and James Conner ... Cowboys-Saints preview (55:15)! We've got a lot to discuss here, but nothing more difficult than Ezekiel Elliott and Alvin Kamara. How do Dave and Heath feel about these guys and the other relevant players in this game? ...
