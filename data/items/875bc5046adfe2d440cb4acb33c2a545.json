  "description": "<p>An ever expanding mystery to biologist and physicist alike, the human brain is truly the final frontier in understanding our universe, our world, and ourselves.</p> <p>The form and function of your brain literally dictates everything about you. Your ability to choose papaya over Pop Tarts, your ability to choose forgiveness over hate, and your ability to choose courage over fear are all governed by that magnificent 3 pound organ resting inside of your head.</p> <p>Your brain directs hormone function, activation of genetic programs, management of all of your senses and how you experience the world, and so much more. Today you’ll get an accelerated, easy-to-understand masterclass on brain basics.</p> <p>Dr. Daniel Amen is a prolific physician, writer, and speaker who has been a pioneer in transforming our society’s understanding of the human brain, and how the function of our brain deeply impacts every area of our lives.</p> <p>There might not be any information you’ll ever receive that can have a greater impact on your life. If you can change your brain, you can literally change everything about your reality. Learn from Dr. Amen what you can do to ensure you have the best brain possible. Avoid things that hurt your brain, and indulge in the things that help it.
