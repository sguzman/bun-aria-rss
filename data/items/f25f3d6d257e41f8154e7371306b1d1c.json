  "description": "<p>It’s such a common desire to get out of our heads — to escape the nonstop, mostly self-referential chatter, the habitual storylines, the ancient resentments and the compulsive self-criticism. Many of us take elaborate and even drastic measures in this regard like self-medication, shopping, tech addiction, and so on. But there’s a much healthier option that is readily and perpetually available. In fact, we’re dragging it around with us all the time, the body.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>The Buddha is said to have laid out four ways to be mindful. In other words, to be awake to whatever is happening right now.
