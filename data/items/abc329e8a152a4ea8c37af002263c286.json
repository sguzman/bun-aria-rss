  "description": "Greg Kinnear actually bailed on being an actor. Even though he performed in high school plays and hosted his own radio show as a teenager, when he started acting in college he decided it wasn’t for him. As Greg tells Marc, it felt like too much of a crap shoot. So he tried broadcast journalism instead, eventually hosting Talk Soup on the fledgling E! channel and Later on NBC. Greg explains how these gigs led him back to acting, and they discuss some of his best roles in As Good As It Gets, Auto Focus, Little Miss Sunshine, and his new movie Brian Banks. This episode is sponsored by <a href=\"http://anchor.fm/maron\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Anchor</a> (<a href=\"http://anchor.fm/maron\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">anchor.fm/maron</a>), <a href=\"https://www.universalpictures.com/movies/good-boys\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Good Boys from Universal Pictures</a>, <a href=\"http://capterra.com/wtf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Capterra</a> (<a href=\"http://capterra.com/wtf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">capterra.com/WTF</a>), and <a href=\"http://fi.google.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Google Fi</a>. <p>Sign up here for WTF+ to get the full show archives and weekly bonus material!  <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast\">https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast</a>.</p>\n\n<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
