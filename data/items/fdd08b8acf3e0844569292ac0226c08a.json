  "description": "<p>As the November midterms approach, America seems to be heading for another nail-biter. Republicans have long banked on taking control of the House and perhaps the Senate, while Democrats point to recent successes by President Biden and in special elections as evidence that it’s too early for a political obituary. According to the Cook Partisan Voting Index, though, the map favors Republicans on both the House and Senate side. At the same time, there are ever fewer fair fight districts. For analysis we speak with Amy Walter, publisher and editor-in-chief of The Cook Political Report.</p>",
