  "description": "<p>This episode is the Olympics of drag. You're gonna love it so much, you're gonna have three. Putcha Hearts Up, because the fifth annual Summer of Kunt with Sudi Green (the third member of The Three) is finally here. Matt, Bow and Sudi discuss Bowen and Sudi's recent Eurotrip, and the episode largely examines vacation culture as a whole. Also, observations about British people when under heat, what happens when Wicked is British, and parents vacationing with young children come hell or high water. All this, Disney World getting dark, how anal sex can do a real number on your butthole, how Titanique is the best current theatrical experience in New York City, bad behavior as children, Drag Race All Stars and its upcoming grand finale, and how American McDonald's need to take more god damn risks.
