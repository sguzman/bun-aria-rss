  "description": "<p>On today's show, we have another great installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk, as Pat and AJ welcome in two INCREDIBLE guests. First, Super Bowl Champion/MVP, 2x NFL MVP, 3x All-Pro, 8x Pro Bowler, and best friend of both Pat and AJ, Aaron Rodgers calls into the show. They discuss him trying to get out of Peru as the coronavirus quarantines were heating up and how it became a race to get out of the country. Aaron, Pat, and AJ also chat about The Tiger King and give some more of their thoughts, Aaron breaks down his thoughts about the CBA, what he has been doing to keep his body in shape during the quarantine, what he thinks of the Packers offseason moves thus far, and he reacts to whether or not he thinks football season will be starting on time (7:36-1:03:46). Next, the Voice of College Football, one of the most handsome men in America and one of Pat's coworkers, Kirk Herbstreit joins Pat and AJ. They discuss his comments about not knowing if there will be an NCAA or NFL football season this year, and he gives his reasoning why he thinks it might be possible, chats about whether or not he would be interested in the Monday Night Football job if given the opportunity or if it was offered to him, and Kirk tells an incredible story about AJ ending his playing days during a scrimmage at their high school when Kirk had just turned 30 and AJ was going into his Sophomore year at Centerville High School (1:07:17-1:30:40). Today's show is a great one.
