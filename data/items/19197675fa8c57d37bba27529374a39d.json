  "description": "<p>Sir Arthur Lewis was a pioneer. The first black man to win the Economics Nobel Prize, the first black man to be a professor of any university and in any field in the UK and the economist largely seen as the first major thinker in the field of development economics. &nbsp;His &nbsp;\"two sector\" model is taught across the world &nbsp;- &nbsp;but who was the man behind the model and why does he have a building and a mascot named after him at the University of Manchester? What is his (spurious) link with Mancunian musical legends MC Tunes and A Guy Called Gerald. Guiding you through these questions and many more (as always) are Pete and Gav, your friendly neighbourhood economists. Technical support comes from Nic and the music from Jukedeck - you can create your own at <a href=\"http://jukedeck.com/\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">jukedeck.com</a>.</p>\n",
