  "description": "<p>Gary Vider came over to my apartment to do a podcast about dog walking. He's a comedian who's been pretty much making a living walking dogs for the last 5 years. It was a fun talk and of course we meandered a bunch. Also, I've got a new Eats Village (pending better name) in the outro. And the sound was kind of tinny on the intro and outro, sorry. </p>",
