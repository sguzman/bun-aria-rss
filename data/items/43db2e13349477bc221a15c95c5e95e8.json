  "description": "<p>In this 72nd in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens. It’s the Spring equinox, and there are frogs—frogs who are anatomically able to tune out some of the voices of other frogs whom they have no interest in. Then: Bret’s challenge to Ibram Kendi, which includes a simple proof involving dogs and anti-racism. And: the left are increasingly gullible; we provide an example from a class action lawsuit in California against the use of CRT in state agencies. Finally: Is widespread vaccination during a pandemic safe? We discuss the views of a scientist, Geert Vanden Bossche, who argues “no.” <br/><br/> Our book, A Hunter-Gatherer’s Guide to the 21st Century, is now available for pre-sale at amazon.
