In honor of having an episode that's vaguely in the vicinity of 4/20, Connor and Dan did a drug. They also discussed the 1857 book \"The Hasheesh Eater\" written by American essayist, poet, and explorer Fitz Hugh Ludlow. But they may or may not spend ten minutes discussing Star Wars first. Dan also changes the battery in his smoke detector!</p>",
