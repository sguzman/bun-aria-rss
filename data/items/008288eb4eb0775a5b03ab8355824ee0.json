In this episode, Sharon gets the inside scoop on Arctic living from photographer and TikTok sensation Cecilia Blomdahl. Cecilia lives in the northernmost town in the world on the Arctic island of Svalbard. Though not exactly the North Pole, Cecilia sees her fair share of polar bears and reindeer. As well, she spends two months of the winter in complete darkness and two months of the summer in 24-hours of sunlight. From living in a cabin with no running water to whale watching from her front porch, Cecilia’s life is anything but ordinary. Join Sharon and Cecilia as they talk about Cecilia’s grand adventures in Svalbard.</p> <p>For more information on this episode including all resources and links discussed go to <a href= \"https://www.sharonmcmahon.com/podcast\">https://www.sharonmcmahon.com/podcast</a></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
