  "description": "As part of our Black History coverage we look back at the Black Panthers and ask Professor Clayborne Carson of Stanford University \"How radical was the US black rights group?\" Also, we bring you an archive interview with Mary Wilson of the Supremes, we delve into the question of compensation after the abolition of slavery - and no, not compensation for the people who had been enslaved, but for the former slave owners. Also, how one descendent of slaves, James Dawkins, discovered his ancestors' connection with the British writer Richard Dawkins. And, looking back at the story of Henrietta Lacks the African-American whose cells revolutionised medical science.\n\nPhoto: Schoolchildren at a Black Panthers breakfast club. Credit: Shutterstock",
