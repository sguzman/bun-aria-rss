We will give you five realities about biology, and they might even help you be kinder to your body. <br/><br/>Here's what to remember: <br/>- Metabolism slows when you lose weight.<br/>- Hormonal changes that come with weight loss make you hungrier. <br/>- What you eat is more important than how much you exercise.<br/>- Exercise seems to play a big role in maintaining weight and preventing further gain.",
