  "title": "83: Transcontinental Railroad (pt 1): Industrialization, Ted Judah & The Rise of the Central Pacific",
  "description": "“Every great enterprise has been ridiculed in the outset.”\nThis is the story of the rise of the railroad.\nTravel on land is slow. Arduous. Inhibited by rough terrain like mountains, rivers, and bogs. That reality makes Americans view the continent’s interior as an inaccessible “Great Desert,” only to be visited by daring pioneers passing through en route to Oregon Country or California.\nBut technology is changing. “Iron horses” are starting to run at rapid speeds across rails. And as these rails stretch across the east, some dreamers, thought crazy, are suggesting this rail could traverse the entire continent. \nCould the US Government support such a ludicrous idea? It seems impossible, but might such a rail help keep the massive, continent-wide nation together as Civil War breaks out? Theodore “Crazy” Judah thinks so, and teaming up with four influential, business-savvy Californians, he means to find out. This is the rise of the Central Pacific Railroad.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
