  "description": "Two vastly different stories of children made from snow. The first is one where the king is called on to solve some dating issues...but then discovers something far colder is at play.

You can't prove otherwise so what are you going to do about it? The creature this week is one that likes to make his home (and his toilet!) out of cinnamon. --- Sponsors: Credit Karma: Check out the app or http://creditkarma.com to get always free reports about your credit score!
