The problem is that OP's sister keeps pretending that she's the one who's pregnant. When OP and her sister go shopping, a considerate worker offers OP a chair because, well, she is actually pregnant. OP's sister flips out and says that she's the one who deserves the chair because it's her child. OP yells at her sister that even though it's her sister's child, OP is the one who is actually pregnant and she's exhausted from constantly running around.\n",
