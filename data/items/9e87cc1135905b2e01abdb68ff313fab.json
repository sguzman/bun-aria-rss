We played back the funniest Freaky Friday Moments with one including \"Phone Sex with The Breakfast Club\". We also played back the interview when Jemelle Hill and Cari Champion stopped by and spoke about their new show, conflicts at ESPN and Skip Bayless and more. Also, before the break they spoke with writer and director Deon Taylor about his new thriller Fatale and more. Also, we rewinded the time Charalamagne gave \"Donkey of the Day\" to Jeffrey Toobin for being caught watching porn, and doing some touching during a work call.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
