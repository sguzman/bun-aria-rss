The mind is such a fascinating thing. As much as science and technology has advanced there is still so much more to learn. When it comes to mindset, controlling your emotions, feeling pain and responding to thoughts both positive and negative, all of these things are within your control, yet most of us spend life as if we were never granted permission to control our own minds. In this episode, four powerhouse forces join together and break down how to upgrade your mindset and gain control over your mind, your thoughts, your behaviors and ultimately your success. Dr. Joe Dispenza, Sadhguru, Jay Shetty, and Tom Bilyeu are lighting the path to show you exactly what you can do today to take over your thoughts and upgrade your mindset and change your life.   Saddhguru’s Full Episode on Impact Theory: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Gw1I7fqmxmA\" rel=\"noopener\">https://youtu.be/Gw1I7fqmxmA</a> Jay Shetty’s Full Episode on Impact Theory: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/v1BwF7XkkuM\" rel=\"noopener\">https://youtu.be/v1BwF7XkkuM</a> Dr Joe Dispenza’s Full Episode on Impact Theory: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/La9oLLoI5Rc\" rel=\"noopener\">https://youtu.be/La9oLLoI5Rc</a>   SHOW NOTES:   0:00 | Introduction Upgrade Your Mindset 0:54 | Control Your Thoughts 4:34 | Change Your Habits 8:05 | Identity & Value Matters 12:00 | Training Your Brain 17:17 | Inspiration Isn’t Enough 19:34 | Control Your Emotions 27:53 | Control Your Negative Voice 35:11 | Get In Tune With Senses 39:49 | Focus On The Pursuit   QUOTES:   “The habit is when you've done something so many times, that your body now knows how to do it better than your mind.” Joe Dispenza [7:09]   “Unleashing human potential, it is not about reaching the peak. It is a trajectory. Because what our life is, is a combination of a certain amount of time and energy.” Sadhguru [13:34]   “My thoughts, my emotions, my energy and my body or my instruments of function. They are not impediments in my life.” Sadhguru [16:01]   “You have to come to realize where you have been blind. Now often those moments, where we realize we’ve been blind are emotionally devastating.” Tom Bilyeu  [18:23]   “I’m going to let that rock hit me in the head because at my feet now is actually a nugget of gold, and I’m going to pick up that nugget of gold and form the lesson that the person is throwing at me.” Tom Bilyeu [21:16]   “The hardest part about change is not making the same choices you did the day before, period. And the moment you decide to make a different choice, get ready because it’s going to feel uncomfortable.” Dr. Joe Dispenza [25:48]   “Pain is a good thing physically because that is your self preservation mechanism. But suffering is something that you do in your mind.” Sadhguru [27:56]   “Because you’re more likely to believe something negative, don’t worry about what’s true. Worry about what empowers you.” [42:08]   “Life is actually embracing polarities. It’s actually about doing a dance, and knowing which way to go at the right time.”  [43:29]   Follow Sadhguru: <a href=\"https://isha.sadhguru.org/us/en\" rel=\"noopener\">https://isha.sadhguru.org/us/en</a> Follow Jay Shetty: <a href=\"https://jayshetty.me/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://jayshetty.me/</a> Follow Dr Joe Dispenza: <a href=\"https://drjoedispenza.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://drjoedispenza.com/</a>",
