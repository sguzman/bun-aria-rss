  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">One of the most exciting things we can teach our children is that Jesus came to earth as a tiny baby and that he’s coming back as the King. This past-and-future perspective is at the heart of the Advent season as we celebrate what has happened and wait expectantly for what is to come. In this episode, Emily and Laura explain the meaning of Advent, share ways to celebrate, and encourage moms to find freedom in the Christmas season. Instead of running into the holidays with added pressure of one more thing, we can look to Christ and celebrate the gospel story in our homes from an overflow of joy.</span></p> <p><a class= \"sqs-block-button-element--small sqs-block-button-element\" href= \"https://www.risenmotherhood.com/transcriptions/ep-177-the-most-wonderful-time-of-the-year-transcript\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-initialized=\"true\">View Transcript</a></p> <p><a href=\"http://risenmotherhood.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Risen Motherhood</a> on <a href= \"http://instagram.com/risenmotherhood\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Instagram</a>, <a href= \"http://www.facebook.com/risenmotherhood\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Facebook</a>, & <a href= \"https://twitter.com/RisenMotherhood\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Twitter</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.risenmotherhood.com/show-archive/ep-177-the-most-wonderful-time-of-the-year\"> Find all of the links & related resources from the show HERE</a></p> <p><a href=\"https://www.risenmotherhood.com/advent\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">R|M Resources for Advent</span></a></p> <p><em><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">We’re grateful to Moody Publishers, publishers of the new books,</span> <a href= \"https://5lovelanguages.com/screenkids/\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Screen Kids</span></a> <span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">and</span> <a href= \"https://5lovelanguages.com/screenkids/\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Grandparenting Screen Kids</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, for helping make this week’s show possible!
