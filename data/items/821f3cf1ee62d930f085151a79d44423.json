Then Mark and Richard dive deep into how growth equals change, and they share some of the toughest challenges they’ve faced on their own journeys of consistent growth.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this series is The Consistent Growth Worksheet, which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching.
