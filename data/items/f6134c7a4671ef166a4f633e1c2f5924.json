  "description": "This week on the podcast, the guys continue discussing accountability versus bullying and the very fine line between them. The guys go back to when they started to work together and discuss how their relationships and roles developed over the years. In those early days, their relationships were different and, so were the levels of accountability between them. But, once the vision became clear, the levels of accountability clearly shifted. How did ET deal with it? Was it bullying at the beginning? The guys tell all as they reflect on where they started, where they are and, how they got there.  The Secret to Success Topics:\n  [05:41] - Trey’s Comedy Corner\n [10:23] - Karl’s Story\n [20:53] - It’s Not Easy\n [30:00] - The 1st\n [41:00] - During COVID\n [52:00] - Creating Wealth\n [1:02:00] - Reapply\n  Listener Perks:\n  Organifi is giving our listeners 20% off of their order just go to www.organifi.com/success.
