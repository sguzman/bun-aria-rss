  "description": "<p>You don’t have to be a parent to recognize that parenting during COVID is a struggle. When the coronavirus shut down daycare facilities and schools across the country in March, parents became not only full time caretakers, but also teachers, coaches and playdates for their suddenly isolated kids. And working parents — those lucky enough to be able to keep their jobs or work remotely during the shutdown — have had to also find time in the day to do the job that pays the bills. For single working parents, or black or brown parents, that impossible situation, that non-existent work-life balance, is an even heavier burden to bear. But this isn’t new for Christine Michel Carter. In fact, the marketing strategist, working-mom advocate and best-selling author has been “Chicken Little” for the past five years, running around telling everyone the work-life balance sky was falling. COVID just exacerbated the reality. “The world is exposed to the fact that even in married two-income households — unlike mine — women are three times more likely to be the spouse who carries the additional burden of the mental load of just everything that’s going on,” she says. On this episode of Back to Biz with Katie and Boz, co-host Bozoma Saint John talks with Christine about about how to build a better employer-employee relationship, one that doesn’t compartmentalize mothers and fathers, but allows people to bring their whole selves — kids, school mishaps, doctor appointments, birthday parties and all — to the office (or the zoom meeting). Christine and Boz share their own struggles of being a parent in the corporate world, how communities of color are disproportionately affected, and what that so-called work-life balance could look like on the other side of this pandemic. </p><p>Check out Christine Michel Carter’s book, “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/MOM-AF-Christine-Michel-Carter/dp/1734122706\">Mom AF</a>.”</p><p>For more, subscribe to Katie Couric’s morning newsletter, “<a href=\"https://katiecouric.com/newsletter\">Wake-Up Call</a>.”</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
