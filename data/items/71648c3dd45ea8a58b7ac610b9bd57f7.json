  "description": "<p>We study the Hopf property for wreath products of finitely generated groups,\nfocusing on the case of an abelian base group. Our main result establishes a\nstrong connection between this problem and Kaplansky's stable finiteness\nconjecture. Namely, the latter holds true if and only if for every finitely\ngenerated abelian group $A$ and every finitely generated Hopfian group $\\Gamma$\nthe wreath product $A \\wr \\Gamma$ is Hopfian. In fact, we characterize\nprecisely when $A \\wr \\Gamma$ is Hopfian, in terms of the existence of\none-sided units in certain matrix algebras over $\\mathbb{F}_p[\\Gamma]$, for\nevery prime factor $p$ occurring as the order of some element in $A$. A tool in\nour arguments is the fact that fields of positive characteristic locally embed\ninto matrix algebras over $\\mathbb{F}_p$ thus reducing the stable finiteness\nconjecture to the case of $\\mathbb{F}_p$. A further application of this result\nshows that the validity of Kaplansky's stable finiteness conjecture is\nequivalent to a version of Gottschalk's surjunctivity conjecture for additive\ncellular automata.\n</p>",
