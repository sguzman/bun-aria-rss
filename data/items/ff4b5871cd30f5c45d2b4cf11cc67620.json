  "description": "<p>In many sequential decision-making problems (e.g., robotics control, game\nplaying, sequential prediction), human or expert data is available containing\nuseful information about the task. However, imitation learning (IL) from a\nsmall amount of expert data can be challenging in high-dimensional environments\nwith complex dynamics. Behavioral cloning is a simple method that is widely\nused due to its simplicity of implementation and stable convergence but doesn't\nutilize any information involving the environment's dynamics. Many existing\nmethods that exploit dynamics information are difficult to train in practice\ndue to an adversarial optimization process over reward and policy approximators\nor biased, high variance gradient estimators. We introduce a method for\ndynamics-aware IL which avoids adversarial training by learning a single\nQ-function, implicitly representing both reward and policy. On standard\nbenchmarks, the implicitly learned rewards show a high positive correlation\nwith the ground-truth rewards, illustrating our method can also be used for\ninverse reinforcement learning (IRL). Our method, Inverse soft-Q learning\n(IQ-Learn) obtains state-of-the-art results in offline and online imitation\nlearning settings, significantly outperforming existing methods both in the\nnumber of required environment interactions and scalability in high-dimensional\nspaces, often by more than 3x.\n</p>",
