  "description": "Americans in China: Encounters with the People’s Republic (Oxford, 2022) tells the stories of men and women who have lived and worked in China from before the Communist era to the present. Their experiences provide unique insights and deeply human perspectives on issues that have shaped US engagement with the PRC: politics, diplomacy, education, science, business, art, law, journalism, and human rights. Looming over their narratives is the quandary of whether divergent Chinese and Western worldviews could find common ground.\nTerry Lautz, former vice president of the Henry Luce Foundation, has chaired the Harvard-Yenching Institute, the Lingnan Foundation, and the Yale-China Association. Dr. Lautz holds degrees from Harvard College and Stanford University and is the author of John Birch: A Life (Oxford, 2016).\n﻿Dong Wang is distinguished professor of history and director of the Wellington Koo Institute for Modern China in World History at Shanghai University (since 2016), a member of the Royal Institute of International Affairs, and an elected Fellow of the Royal Asiatic Society of Great Britain and Ireland.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
