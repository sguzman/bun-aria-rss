  "description": "<p>Actor Jussie Smollett’s Chicago trial on charges that he faked a hate crime attack on himself has begun. 39-year-old Smollett was starring in the television show “Empire” when he claimed he was attacked by two men who hurled racial and homophobic slurs at him. They also left a noose around his neck. Two brothers who worked as extras on “Empire” later came forward and said Smollett had paid them to “attack” him. Prosecutors charged the actor but Cook County Prosecutor Kim Foxx dropped all the charges in return for community service and forfeiture of his bond. Outrage prompted the appointment of a special prosecutor, who indicted Smollett on six disorderly conduct charges.</p><p>Joining Nancy Grace Today:</p><ul>\n<li>Prof. Brian Levin - Director, Center for the Study of Hate & Extremism, California State University (San Bernardino), Co-author: \"The Limits of Dissent\", CSUSB.edu/Hate-and-Extremism-Center, Twitter: @proflevin</li>\n<li>LAWYER - Wendy Patrick - California prosecutor, author “Red Flags” www.wendypatrickphd.com 'Today with Dr. Wendy' on KCBQ in San Diego, Twitter: @WendyPatrickPHD</li>\n<li>Dr. Angela Arnold - Psychiatrist, Atlanta GA, www.angelaarnoldmd.com, Former Medical Director of The Psychiatric Ob-Gyn Clinic at Grady Memorial Hospital</li>\n<li>Joe Scott Morgan - Professor of Forensics: Jacksonville State University, Author, \"Blood Beneath My Feet\", Host: \"Body Bags with Joseph Scott Morgan\"</li>\n<li>Alexis Tereszcuk - CrimeOnline.com Investigative Reporter, Writer/Fact Checker, Lead Stories dot Com, Twitter: @swimmie2009</li>\n<li><br></li>\n</ul><p><strong>TIP LINE: Chicago Police Department </strong>(312) 746-6000</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
