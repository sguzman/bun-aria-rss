  "description": "<p>r/Prorevenge In today's episode, OP recounts a story from his youth when his family was down on their luck and had to rent a place in a trailer park. The home they rented was repulsive. They had leaks, a cockroach infestation, mold, and the entire place was completely falling apart. Their landlord didn't care at all -- the only thing he card about was that they paid rent. So when one of their pipes starts to leak, OP's family doesn't bother reporting it! This leads to thousands of dollars of wasted water and hugely expensive repair costs that add up to $25,000!</p>\n",
