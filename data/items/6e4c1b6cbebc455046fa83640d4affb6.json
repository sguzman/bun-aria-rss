  "description": "The <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/2280832-delta-variant-doubles-risk-of-covid-19-hospitalisations-study-shows/'>delta variant of covid-19</a> has torn across India, and is making its way around the globe, forcing the extension of lockdown measures in the UK. The team explores its spread, and also digs into findings showing that “elimination countries” - those which enacted swift and extreme lockdown measures - have <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/2280607-zero-covid-countries-have-done-best-and-its-not-too-late-to-switch/'>fared better across the board in the health, wealth and even freedom of their populations</a>. They then discuss the <a href='https://www.ice-memory.org/'>Ice Memory Project</a>, which is archiving and preserving material and data from glaciers - ancient relics that have been trapped in the ice for millennia, sadly thawing due to global warming. There’s a conversation with forensic psychiatrist and psychotherapist Gwen Adshead about the capacity we all have for evil - the subject of her new book ‘<a href='https://www.amazon.co.uk/Devil-You-Know-Stories-Compassion/dp/0571357601'>The Devil You Know</a>’. On top of that, there’s the news that China has launched the first group of astronauts to <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/2281304-china-has-launched-the-first-astronauts-to-its-new-space-station/'>its new space station</a> and laid out its plans for an international moon base, and a story about <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/2280826-female-seahorses-cheat-on-their-mate-when-they-can-no-longer-smell-him/'>monogamy in seahorses</a>, where it is the males who get pregnant.
