  "title": "T. C. F. Stunt, \"The Life and Times of Samuel Prideaux Tregelles: A Forgotten Scholar\" (Springer, 2019)",
  "description": "For the sixty years in which he has made a distinguished contribution to the religious history of the nineteenth century, Timothy Stunt has been working on the life and times of Samuel Prideaux Tregelles, the New Testament textual critic. In his previous books, scholarly articles, and entries in the Oxford Dictionary of National Biography, Stunt has developed the commitment to prosopography that makes his new book so important and so compelling. The Life and Times of Samuel Prideaux Tregelles: A Forgotten Scholar is an outstanding example of how intellectual biography can shed light on complex and sometimes misunderstood contexts. Stunt shows how Tregelles moved from humble origins, overcoming educational barriers through ambition and determination, to become a serious rival to textual critics like Constantin von Tischendorf, demonstrating the sense of duty to scholarly excellence that would almost certainly lead to the ill-health in which his life ended. Today, Stunt reminds us, Tregelles is no longer forgotten, and his critical text of the New Testament has formed the basis of the most recent edition to be published by Cambridge University Press. Tune in to find out more.\nCrawford Gribben is a professor of history at Queen’s University Belfast. His research interests focus on the history of puritanism and evangelicalism, and he is the author most recently of Survival and Resistance in evangelical America: Christian Reconstruction in the Pacific Northwest (Oxford UP, 2021).\nLearn more about your ad choices.
