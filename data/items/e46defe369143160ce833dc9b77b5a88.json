These are preferences we all share, but few of us achieve them. Perhaps we could, if only we made better choices. We all want to make better decisions – the salad over the burger, the restful night’s sleep over ‘one more episode’ – yet we continue to succumb to our desires. Perhaps we need some help: maybe we need something to nudge us in the right direction?</p> <p class=\"\">In this episode, we’ll be discussing the philosophy of nudges with Professor Thomas Schramme. Chair of Philosophy at the University of Liverpool, Thomas’s research focuses on moral and political philosophy and the philosophy of health and medicine. With over one hundred publications and heading several innovative projects – including ‘How Does it Feel? Interpersonal Understanding and Affective Empathy’ – Professor Schramme is not only an expert in his field but always communicates his ideas through accessible and engaging prose.</p> <p class=\"\">As we’ll find in this interview, Schramme challenges some of the most prominent ideas in contemporary politics and psychology. According to Daniel Kehneman, nudges ‘have changed the world’… but, asks Schramme, do they always change it for the better?</p> <div id=\"block-95a15fed71b43e322b7c\" class= \"sqs-block horizontalrule-block sqs-block-horizontalrule\" data-block-type=\"47\"> <div class=\"sqs-block-content\"> <hr /></div> </div> <div id=\"block-81a5d2f92849ac3dce9f\" class= \"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\"> <div class=\"sqs-block-content\"> <p>This episode is produced in partnership with the <a href= \"https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/philosophy/research/research-projects/philosophy-and-the-future/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Philosophy and the Future</a> project at the <a href=\"https://www.liverpool.ac.uk/philosophy/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">University of Liverpool</a>.
