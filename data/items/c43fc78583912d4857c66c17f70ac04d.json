  "description": "<p>Episode 202 - Hands down one of my favorite drummers, Sammy Siegler, makes his appearance on the show this week. He’s played in Gorilla Biscuits, Youth of Today, Side By Side, Glassjaw, Rival Schools, Limp Bizkit (!) and currently plays in World Be Free. Needless to say, the guy is prolific and we dive DEEP into his life in and around music from his days as a 12 year old in NYC, how he collaborates with such a wide range of musicians and keeping your eyes open for opportunities. Sammy was very gracious with his time and I hope you enjoy the conversation. - - Use our Amazon Affiliate Code to support the show!</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
