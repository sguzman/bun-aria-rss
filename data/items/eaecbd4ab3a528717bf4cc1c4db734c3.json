  "description": "Imagine: A coup attempt in which the coup leaders justify taking power because of massive voter fraud. Or imagine a government using force against thousands of peaceful demonstrators. Now imagine that those things were not taking place in the US on behalf of America's disgraced former president but were instead happening in Myanmar and Russia. Suddenly, the new administration faces its first international challenges and if they are not precisely the same as threats posed recently in the US by the last administration, they rhyme. What to do? We discuss with Chicago Council on Global Affairs CEO Amb. Ivo Daalder, the American Enterprise Institute's Kori Schake and David Sanger of the New York Times. Join us.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
