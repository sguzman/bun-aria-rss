  "description": "Your family or your past does not define you! You don’t have to be the most qualified, the most experienced, or come from the most influential family for God to bless you and take you higher. You may feel like you have some disadvantages that you were born into, but God is choosing you to start a generational blessing! Ephesians 1:5 tells us that God has adopted us into His own family. Because you’ve been adopted, you’re going to come into blessings that you didn’t deserve and favor that you didn’t work for. You can let go of the limits today! It’s time to step into the family of God and be covered in His favor, goodness and power.<p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
