  "description": "On today's show, Pat welcomes Rams Punter, Johnny Hekker, after his huge game last night against the Chiefs. They chat about whether or not it was just another game, how tough it is to punt to Tyreek Hill, and how many different balls he has in his arsenal (7:09-16:54). Later, Pat recaps his trip to LA and how crazy it was from NXT to Monday Night Football to the news about commentating a college football game this weekend with AJ Hawk to playing Horse with Lamar Odom. Digs also stops by to talk about last night's game and to recap week 11 of the NFL. Closing out the show is an incredible conversation with Rich Eisen from his studio in LA. They chat about how he had to rebuild his podcast, and he remembers a story about asking Roger Goodell some tough questions on one of the first episodes of his rebranded podcast (1:00:33-1:27:15). It's a good one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.\n",
