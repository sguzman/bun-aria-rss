  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, it's funny how the Democrat Party that allowed Russia to annex Crimea and voted to reduce military and defense spending while Russia was ramping up their military, is now talking tough on Russia despite their record of weakness. There is no new information in this latest scam to attack the president, it's more of Adam Schiff's Castro-like soliloquy of lies. Regardless of what they say, President Trump's phone call with newly-elected President Zelensky was legitimate. Then, similar to the spying scandal started by the FBI's operation Crossfire Hurricane, which has turned out to be largely coordinated by rogue elements within the FBI's leadership, the impeachment sham also lacks legitimacy. Let us not forget that it is Trump that is the victim in all of this, not the aggressor. Later, President Trump is the first President to speak at the March for Life rally in Washington, DC. After, on the 70th anniversary of Auschwitz, we reflect on a report that 60% of millennials don't know what the Holocaust and 40 percent of adults don't know either.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
