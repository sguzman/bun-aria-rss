  "description": "<p>You won’t be surprised to hear that we’re critical of the consumeristic society we live in. Our culture wants us to believe that buying <em>things</em> will lead to greater levels of happiness. And maybe we’ve been convinced because 70% of the overall economy is driven by consumer spending. Here’s an alternate take though: our generation seems to value experiences more than stuff, but are <em>experiences</em> a better use of our money? Will we be able to find more happiness through greater spending on a cool trip or nicer clothes? Regardless, we definitely want to put our money towards the things we actually value because it turns out that the far reaching effects of mindless spending can leave you broke and wanting more from your experiences and stuff.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Divided Sky Rye IPA by 4 Hands Brewing - a big thanks to Justin for donating this beer to the show!
