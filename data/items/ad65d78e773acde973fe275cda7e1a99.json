  "description": "Ben-Gurion University researchers have developed a new artificial intelligence technique that will protect medical devices from malicious operating instructions in a cyberattack as well as other human and system errors. Complex medical devices such as CT (computed tomography), MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) and ultrasound machines are controlled by instructions sent from a host PC. Abnormal or anomalous instructions introduce many potentially harmful threats to patients, such as radiation overexposure, manipulation of device components or functional manipulation of medical images. Threats can occur due to cyberattacks, human errors such as a technician's configuration mistake or host PC software bugs.\nAs part of his Ph.D. research, Tom Mahler has developed a technique using artificial intelligence that analyzes the instructions sent from the PC to the physical components using a new architecture for the detection of anomalous instructions.\nJoining us in this week's Research Saturday to discuss his research is CBG - Cyber@Ben Gurion University's Tom Mahler.\nThe research can be found here: \nA Dual-Layer Architecture for the Protection of Medical Devices from Anomalous Instructions",
