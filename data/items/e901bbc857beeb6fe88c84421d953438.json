  "description": "<p>In today's episode, I am joined in studio by my longtime podcasting friend Srini Rao, host of the incredible Unmistakable Creative podcast (https://unmistakablecreative.com/), on which I've been a guest many times.<br/><br/>Srini helps me answer your questions on both deep work and the deep life. We also talk about his podcasting company recently raising a series A round of venture capital funding, and what it was like appearing on the Netflix reality show Indian Matchmaker.<br/><br/>I apologize that I don't have timestamps for the individual questions for this episode. In the moment, I forgot to take notes. In future collaborative Q&A episodes I'll make sure to get the questions written down so I can deliver the timestamps to you here.<br/><br/>Thanks to Jay Kerstens for the intro music and Mark Miles for mastering.</p>",
