  "description": "<p>Where do feelings come from? And why do we have them? In this four-part series, we're digging deep into our emotions. </p>\n<p>In this first episode, we're getting happy! We'll get a play-by-play of the chemicals in our brain that trigger joyful feelings, and use the zoom ray to see what good vibes do for our bodies. We'll also hear about how each of us have different emotional thermostats and why thinking about our feelings can help us figure out what to do with them. </p>\n<p>At the end of this episode -- and every episode in this series -- Mallika Chopra shares a meditation that can help us manage our feelings. For more on meditation and mindfulness, <a href=\"https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/mallika-chopra/just-breathe/9780762491582/\">you can check out Mallika Chopraâ€™s book for kids, </a><em><a href=\"https://www.hachettebookgroup.com/titles/mallika-chopra/just-breathe/9780762491582/\">Just Breathe.</a></em></p>\n<p>This episode is sponsored by Old El Paso, Rebel Girls the Podcast (rebelgirls.co/podcast), Relay (relaygo.com/BRAINS for 15% your Relay purchase on Amazon) and New Cloud Control Cat Litter by Arm & Hammer.</p>\n",
