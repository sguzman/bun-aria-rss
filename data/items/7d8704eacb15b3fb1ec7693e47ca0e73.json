  "description": "While some may look at the Trump coup attempt on January 6th as the last desperate act of the disgraced former president to remain in power, it is already being seen among white supremacist groups as a long expected signal of an escalation in domestic unrest leading to a civil war they have long planned and hoped for. The fact that Trump is likely to go unpunished for leading the January 6th effort and the Republican Party is taking a strong stand against accountability for that assault may only make matters worse. We discuss the case for Trump's conviction by the Senate, how we got to the 6th and what it augurs for the future with Elizabeth Neumann, Director of the Republican Accountability Project and former U.S. Assistant Secretary of Homeland Security and Ryan Goodman, co-editor of \"Just Security\" and professor of law at NYU Law School. Don't miss this chilling conversation.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
