  "description": "This is not the Beauty and the Beast you've heard. It's not even the story the one you've heard is based on. That one is a super-pared-down version of an 18th century French novella. The original contains way too much description about fairy politics and power structures, 18th century Pandora, and an idea for a \"Downton Abbey\" reboot...with monkeys. The creature of the week is Papa Bois, from Trinidad and Tobago. He will show you why regular exercise and a balanced diet of strangers lost in the forest will keep you healthy well into old age. Our super-awesome sponsor: Loot Crate (don't forget the code Legends) The other awesome sponsor: Casper. All that in the ad was true. These things are amazing.
