  "description": "<p>Nate and Brian discuss whether it's possible to write a good story based on a truth you wanted to communicate. This is a key question for Christian writers / artists / movie-makers, and misunderstanding it is what makes so much Christian art bad. To be honest, misunderstanding this is also what makes so much far-left woke creative projects terrible as well. Basically, you can't write a story \"top-down.\" Plus, the guys get into a discussion of hidden themes and Easter eggs in N.D. Wilson's works... any of the rest of you besides Ryan notice the Ruth-Boaz allusion in Ashtown?</p>",
