  "description": "<p>Call it a sick day.\nGriffin succumbed to the Andromeda Strain this week, leaving Frushtick, Hoops and myself to brave The Besties without him. I confess, it was tough. Fortunately, we had two very different, very unusual games to discuss in the forms of Proteus and Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance.\nProteus is what you might call an art game. Drawn in colorful and simple polygons, the game lacks traditional goals and rules. When Proteus was released a few weeks ago, a band of perturbed critics claimed Proteus wasn't a game at all.\nMetal Gear Rising: Revengeance on the other hand is the stereotypical action video game. The neo-future world is chock-full of robots and foot soldiers that can be sliced like a watermelon in Fruit Ninja. The game has a clear goal and that's KILL, KILL, KILL!\nTo kill or chase a frog: that is the question.\n<p>03:00 - Proteus<br />\n16:30 - Half Time / The spread of the Andromeda Strain<br />\n20:30 - Metal Gear Rising: Revengeance<br />\n40:30 - What's next? Tomb Raider and SimCity</p>\n<p>Theme song by Ian Dorsch<br />\nGet the show:</p>\n<p>Download MP3\"<br />\nSubscribe to the podcast (RSS)<br />\nSubscribe on iTunes</p></p>\n",
