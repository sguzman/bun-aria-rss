Early in my medical career I attended a lecture given by Dr. Bland and it changed the trajectory of my career. At its core, Functional Medicine seeks to identify and address the root causes of disease, and views the body as one integrated system, not a collection of independent organs divided up by medical specialties. Having my mentor join me for this conversation was truly a delight and an honor.</p><p>A quick note: it would mean so much to me if you left a review - for whatever reason, those go a very long way, and they mean a lot to us.
