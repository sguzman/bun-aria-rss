  "description": "Vincent Van Gogh's \"Sunflowers\" was sold at auction at Christie's in London in March 1987 for 39.9 million dollars - then a world record and more than double the previous top price paid for an artwork at auction. The sale made front-page headlines and is now seen as the moment the international art market went through the roof. Uma Doraiswamy talks to Lord Charles Hindlip, then the chairman of Christie's and the man who auctioned the painting. \n\nPHOTO: \"Sunflowers\" arriving in Japan in 1987 after its sale at Christie's (Getty Images)",
