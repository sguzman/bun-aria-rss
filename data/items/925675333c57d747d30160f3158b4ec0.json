  "description": "<p>If you heard that there was a piece of technology that could do away with traffic jams, make cities more equitable, and help us solve climate change, you might think about driverless cars, or hyperloops or any of the other new transportation technologies that get lots of hype these days. But there is a much older, much less sexy piece of machinery that could be the key to making our cities more sustainable, more liveable, and more fair: the humble bus. Steve Higashide is a transit expert, bus champion, and author of a new book called <em>Better Busses Better Cities</em>. And the central thesis of the book is that buses have the power to remake our cities for the better. </p>\n<p><a href=\"https://99percentinvisible.org/?p=31267&post_type=episode\" target=\"_blank\">Missing the Bus</a></p>\n",
