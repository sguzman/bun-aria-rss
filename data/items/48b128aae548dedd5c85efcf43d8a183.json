  "description": "<p>This week we're discussing creativity and specifically how to spark new ideas or creative energy. For Louise, the impetus seems to come when she is most busy, so that she has less time to think and dabble and is forced to take action quickly. For Alice, space and time and quiet are very important ... without that, she doesn't feel there's room for new ideas. But we both agree that outside input or external stimuli are vital, whether that is a conversation with another artist, an exhibition, a book, or just a trip on the tube. And we both feel that the best ideas often come from unexpected sources. - something just ignites that spark. We also discuss how we choose which ideas to bring to fruition and which to leave on what Alice calls \"the idea shelf.\" As always, we have some points of similarity and some differences, so hopefully this conversation will help you think through your own creative process - maybe there are things you could do to create the ideal conditions for maximum creativity?<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Mentioned:</strong></p>\n<p>Please vote for the Art Juice podcast here!<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.britishpodcastawards.com/vote\">https://www.britishpodcastawards.com/vote</a></p>\n<p>Find Tracey's book of Moems and order your own copy here:<br>\n<a href=\"https://www.traceyelizabethdowning.com/poemsandgiftcard\"><u><strong>https://www.traceyelizabethdowning.com/poemsandgiftcard</strong></u></a></p>\n<p><br>\nSign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\">bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</a></p>\n<p>Buy us a coffee at: <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\">https://ko-fi.com/artjuice</a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p>Alice <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com@alicesheridanstudio/\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p>Louise <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><em>Credits</em></p>\n<p><em>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</em></p>\n",
