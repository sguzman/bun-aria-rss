  "description": "<p>Not this. But actually? AbsoLUTELY this! Bow & Matt are joined by the one true legend Jan Sport to discuss recent hurricane drama, RuPaul's Drag Race All Stars 6, seeing yourself edited into a reality TV character, Fire Island, receiving adulation from your elders, and what we miss and don't miss about Broadway. Also! After Jan won this year's Rusical as Gaga...the girls have a full on Gaga moment. They talk the many *faces* and *eras* of Gaga. Namely, Jan's formative culture: the \"Paparazzi\" performance from the 2009 VMAs. Also!! How \"Venus\" did not get the credit. Also!!! How the year 2010 was the era when the pop girls were really and truly girling. All this, Gaga and Beyonce's impacts on each other, what we expect from House of Gucci and the filmography of Ridley Scott (should we trust him with the doll?), a moment of Vonzell Solomon appreciation, what it felt like to see Laganja Estranja leap out onto the main stage as the lipsync assassin against the incredible Trinity K. Bonet and this question: Shouldn't there be a MIss Congeniality Broadway musical? If there's a Broadway musical of everything else? This episode? Canon. Jan? Sport. Las? Cultch. You're?
