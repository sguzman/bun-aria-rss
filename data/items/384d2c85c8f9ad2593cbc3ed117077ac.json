  "description": "With Russia’s military bogged down in Ukraine, there is hope that the conflict could be over in a matter of weeks, especially if the Russian leader accepts Elon Musk’s challenge. Then, the metawedding trend is taking off across the globe. Next, Anne Hathaway offers Stephen some sound advice on when to order carrot cake (and when it’s safer to skip it). Catch Anne starring in the new AppleTV+ series, “We Crashed,” about the rise and fall of WeWork. And “The Lost City” star Da’Vine Joy Randolph tells Stephen how much she enjoyed working with Sandra Bullock, and confides that she kept a close eye on her neighbor Brad Pitt’s casita as they lived bubble-style in the Dominican Republic while filming.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
