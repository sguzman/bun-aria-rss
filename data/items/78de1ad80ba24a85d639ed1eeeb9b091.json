  "description": "<p>Scott Soshnick, Eben Novy-Williams and Michael Barr discuss a host of issues related to the business of sports, including Marshawn Lynch’s post-game advice to younger players in the NFL, which has reached the conference finals stage off its playoffs. Lynch, whose Seattle Seahawks lost to the Green Bay Packers, used his platform to tell younger players to take care of their bodies, minds and money. Lynch came out of retirement to play for the Seahawks, giving him a glimpse of life after football. Also discussed is the NFL’s final four, and the star power and brand-name teams still alive. The matchups bode well for television ratings. Also discussed is tonight’s college football national title game between Clemson and LSU, which generates far more money than its ACC opponent. Also talked about are Tony Romo’s broadcasting prospects, and the NBA players’ association starting an accelerator to assist its members in business ventures.</p><p><br></p><p>Hosts: Scott Soshnick, Eben Novy-Williams and Michael Barr</p><p><br></p><p>Producer: Colin Tipton</p><p><br></p><p>To listen to this podcast click here (running time xx:xx)</p><p><br></p><p>To contact the reporters on this story:</p><p>Scott Soshnick in New York at <a href=\"mailto:ssoshnick@bloomberg.net\">ssoshnick@bloomberg.net</a>;</p><p>Eben Novy-Williams in New York at <a href=\"mailto:enovywilliam@bloomberg.net\">enovywilliam@bloomberg.net</a>;</p><p>Michael Barr in New York at <a href=\"mailto:mbarr18@bloomberg.net\">mbarr18@bloomberg.net</a></p><p><br></p><p>To contact the editor responsible for this story:</p><p>Scott Soshnick at <a href=\"mailto:ssoshnick@bloomberg.net\">ssoshnick@bloomberg.net</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
