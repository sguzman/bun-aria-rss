  "description": "Felicia Brenoe is a talented quiltmaker and designer. From teeny tiny log cabin blocks to appliqueing a garden she has designed it all. I really love her philosophy on honoring your personal style. We chat about her book, how living in Norway introduced her to textiles and a tip on how to handle tiny paper piecing!\nhttp://www.feliciasworld.com/\n--------------\nI truly love the internet. How else would I have found about about the quilt designed to celebrate Canada’s 150th anniversary by Kat Tucker of Next Step Quilt Designs? She designed 150 blocks and each is inspired by the story of an Canadian born woman who made a difference.\nnextstepquiltdesigns.blogspot.ca/, \n------------------\nBrenda Ratliff is the dynamic owner of Pink Castle Fabric, organizer of Camp StitchAlot & SewPro and a fabric designer with RJR. I am excited to be working with Brenda as part of the 2017 Aurifil Design team and today we talk about retreats. What they are, how to attend a retreat if you have never done that before, and what to do to have the most enjoyable experience\nhttp://stitchalot.com/\n----------\nHeather Valentine from the Sewing Loft always has loads of fun things at her website. From themed topics to teaching you how to use the embroidery unit on your Baby lock, it’s a great site for information. Heather and I were talking the other day and she mentioned her grandmother had worked for the Coats family, as in Coats & Clark thread… how neat is that! She tells us all about that and how it inspired her to sew and create her Sewing loft company.  \nthesewingloftblog.com/\n================\nvisit American Patchwork & Quilting at http://allpeoplequilt.com\nFacebook - https://www.facebook.com/apqmagazine\nVisit host Pat Sloan at http://www.patsloan.com\nLearn more about your ad choices.
