  "description": "<p>Our goldfish, Larry 6, has died. We remember him (00:02:59 - 00:08:51). College Football is back and it was great to soak in wall to wall action on Saturday (00:08:51 - 00:29:12). Who's back of the week (00:29:12 - 00:46:56). Andy Staples joins the show to talk about the big stories from week 1 College Football including LSU losing to UCLA, Wisconsin's season being over, and Bama keeps on rolling (00:46:56 - 01:33:34). We finish the show with Mt Rushmore of referee calls.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
