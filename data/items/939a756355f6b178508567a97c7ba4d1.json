  "description": "<p>Jemar Tisby (The Color of Compromise) rejoins Phil to discuss his new book, How to Fight Racism. Actual, real steps to be part of the solution, not part of the problem! Plus David French posits that the American church has been infected with something called “Southern shame culture,” which sends Phil on a journey into the “Lost Cause” narrative, confederate monuments, revisionist history and the overwhelming desire to “defend our tribe” and punch back at enemies, real and imagined. It’s a wild, historical journey from the Civil War to Franklin Graham! (And if you don’t like it, it’s David French’s fault.)</p> <p>Bonus for Patreon Subscribers: Phil asks Jemar some tough questions: What’s his take on the CRT controversy in the Southern Baptist Convention? And what about abortion? Since white Christians are more likely to vote for pro-life candidates than Black Christians, does that mean Black Christians don’t care about abortion? It’s a fascinating conversation available to everyone who supports the podcast at any level!</p> <p> </p> <p><a class=\"c-link\" href= \"https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2021/january-web-only/martin-luther-king-jr-racism-racial-justice-policy-change.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link= \"https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2021/january-web-only/martin-luther-king-jr-racism-racial-justice-policy-change.html\" data-sk= \"tooltip_parent\">https://www.christianitytoday.com/ct/2021/january-web-only/martin-luther-king-jr-racism-racial-justice-policy-change.html</a></p> <p><a class=\"c-link\" href= \"https://frenchpress.thedispatch.com/p/where-does-the-south-end-and-christianity\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link= \"https://frenchpress.thedispatch.com/p/where-does-the-south-end-and-christianity\" data-sk= \"tooltip_parent\">https://frenchpress.thedispatch.com/p/where-does-the-south-end-and-christianity</a></p>",
