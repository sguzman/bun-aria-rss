  "description": "<div>It might be an understatement to say that China has a difficult relationship with drugs. Most infamously, the Opium Wars of the 1800s saw British soldiers fight against the Qing dynasty to protect the British right to sell opium to China. When the Qing lost, it wasn’t just the sobriety of their people that they lost – but a series of ports, concessions and reparations signed away in so-called ‘unequal treaties’. Hong Kong was lost to the British at this point, and it’s where the Chinese mark the start of the century of humiliation.</div>\n<br>\n<div>The memory and trauma of opium addiction is still bound up with national decline in the Chinese conscience.</div>\n<br>\n<div>So Cindy Yu was surprised to read about widespread drug use (especially ketamine) in the early 2000s in a recent <a href=\"https://palladiummag.com/2021/06/23/ketamine-and-the-return-of-the-party-state/\">article</a> by the translator and writer Dylan Levi King. Dylan joins this episode, and they talk about what the popularity of ket says about China's reform and opening, how the Chinese see drug abuse as a disease than a crime, and President Xi's moralistic clampdown on the party scene in the years since.</div>\n",
