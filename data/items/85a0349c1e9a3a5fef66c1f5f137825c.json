  "description": "Visit budlight.com/delivery to get your limited edition Bud Light team cans.\nRecaps have returned and it feels great for the Pick Six Superfriends to unite for an instant reaction to a classic of an opener between the Bucs and Cowboys. Will Brinson, Ryan Wilson and John Breech react to Tampa edging Dallas and everything that happened in the NFL Kickoff on Thursday night. Was there ever a doubt that Tom Brady would lead a game-winning drive? The Bucs are fine despite barely surviving the scare and the Cowboys might actually be pretty good. With that being said, there are still a lot of questions around Mike McCarthy and how he handled this game. We cover all those questions. Also, props to Dak Prescott for a brilliant return from injury. If he plays like that all year, Dallas has a great shot to win the division and do some damage in the playoffs. We have to give credit to two 30+ former superstars Rob Gronkowski and Antonio Brown for great games.
