  "title": "PMS 2.0 032 - NFL Defensive Rookie Of The Year",
  "description": "On today’s show, Pat goes live from the Indianapolis Colts facility for an incredible interview with the NFL’s leading tackler, probable Defensive Rookie of the Year, and one of the biggest Pro Bowl snubs in recent memory, The Maniac, Darius Leonard. They cover his upbringing and how he overcame the odds being stacked against him, and who he’s looked to for advice. They also cover his thoughts on the Colts season, how all the slights thrown at him are just adding chips on his shoulder, and how he should take the NFL drug testing him as a compliment (6:37-21:09). Pat and Digs also give a touching tribute to Coach Sacco, their high school football coach who recently passed away, and the guys get into a conversation about Pat’s high school playing days. Later, sports handicapper, source material for the film Two For The Money, and friend of the show, Brandon Lang, calls in to give a couple of red hot NCAA basketball picks, chats a bit about his time caddying for Jim Irsay (and inadvertently takes a couple of shots at Gorman), and looks ahead to this weeks NFL slate while also giving some thoughts on the NCAA football playoff (1:02:17-1:25:45). The guys wrap up the show by diving a tad deeper into the NFL games, and give a few more thoughts on the weight loss competition. It’s a great one. Come and laugh with us. Cheers.\n",
