  "description": "<p><p>KFC went to a wedding with Jared Carrabis and Dallas Braden, and the mother of the bride listened to an episode of KFC Radio. Mike Posner go bit by a rattlesnake but that is still better than how he got treated at the UMASS. Gamers are being blamed for violence and we stand with our gamer brothers. Voicemails: whose twitter would you hack, what's an orgy, doggy in a dress, how would you get fat? </p><p>Jerry O'Connell stops by to talk about The Jerry O Show, My Secret Identity, Bachelor in Paradise, and his love for both the Mets AND Yankees. Adam Brody pays a visit to talk about his new movie Ready  Or Not, atheism, The OC and how Seth Cohen was the original cool nerd.</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
