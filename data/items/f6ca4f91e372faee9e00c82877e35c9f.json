    "media:description": "If you're wondering what games to play at the October Steam Next Fest in 2022, here's a set of five great games that are well worth your time. In this video we'll go through a handful of strategy games, city builders, tactical combat titles and more as we discuss some of the most interesting looking games at Next Fest. This video was made possible due to the developers providing me with early access to their titles and a heads up that they'd be participating in the October Next Fest, and you can expect a follow-up video after the festival is over highlighting more games that I wasn't able to check out beforehand!\n\nFollow me on Twitter: https://twitter.com/_PartyElite\nBecome a member: https://www.youtube.com/c/PartyElite/join\nSupport me on Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/PartyElite\nSend me a Tip: https://streamlabs.com/partyelite\nJoin us on Discord: https://discord.gg/6Tq3ut5\n\n00:00 - Intro\n00:38 - Manor Lords\n03:43 - Inkulinati\n06:00 - Alliance of the Sacred Suns\n07:53 - Capital Command\n09:17 - Against the Storm\n\n#NextFest",
