  "description": "<p>The Biblical find of the century, the Dead Sea Scrolls, were turned over to an international committee for study. Bad idea.

The cabal bamboozled first the Jordanian authorities, then the Israelis. The cabal's stranglehold was only broken by a bunch of academic freedom-fighters in the 1990s.</p>",
