  "description": "<p>Today were back with Ultraman competitor and EPIC5 finisher <a href=\"http://www.christianisakson.com\" target=\"_blank\">Christian Isakson</a> for Part 2 of our conversation.</p><p>Thanks for all the great comments and feedback I received on social media this week in response to Part 1. If you haven’t listened to that one yet dial it up first before tuning in here</p><p>Part 2 just gets better. We delve into Christian's racing. He walks us through his first-hand experience completing EPIC5 and what it took to put his imprimatur on last year's <a href=\"http://www.ultramanlive.com\" target=\"_blank\">Ultraman World Championships</a>.</p><p>Then we turn to service. Christian's commitment to giving back through his involvement with <a href=\"http://www.chrislieto.com\" target=\"_blank\">Chris Lieto's</a> non-profit <a href=\"http://www.morethansport.org\" target=\"_blank\">More Than Sport</a> and and his recent work in Kenya with <a href=\"http://ameenaproject.org\" target=\"_blank\">Ameena Project</a>.&nbsp;And how faith, family and humility are keystones to remain grounded, focused and on point.</p><p>The message is this — if you want your life to have true meaning, satisfaction, fulfillment and a legacy of value, giving back in a meaningful way is essential.</p><p>If you are feeling adrift, Christian's message will help right your ship. If he has inspired you to seek out a more fulfilling path for yourself but you're just not sure how to embark on your own version of his story, then — as mentioned in the introduction to this episode — you might be encouraged by my new online course on <a href=\"http://mbg.is/Se3UWL\" target=\"_blank\">MindBodyGreen.com</a> entitled <a href=\"http://mbg.is/Se3UWL\" target=\"_blank\">The Art of Living With Purpose</a>- 2+ hours of streaming video content with an array of downloadable tools I learned, honed and devised to course correct my life — tools I continue to rely on to this day to keep my life focused and on track. Give it a look if it feels right to you.</p><p>I hope you enjoy Part 2 as much as Part 1.
