  "description": "<p>The fear of missing out- we’ve all experienced that emotion before! Whether some friends are getting together but you’re stuck finishing up a project, or maybe you haven’t been able to get your hands on the latest gaming console (or craft beer!). Well, FOMO has an ability to work its way into many different aspects of our lives, including our financial lives as well. You might feel some serious FOMO seeing individual stocks like Tesla skyrocket this past year while you are investing in plain old index funds. Or maybe with mortgage rates being at all-time lows, you feel like you are the only person in your peer group not buying a house right now. And you don’t want to miss out! This episode is about how to deal with and fend off FOMO so that we don’t make moves that mess up our ultimate goals due to distractions in the world around us.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we shared a Daaank Daniel by Heist Brewery in Charlotte NC.
