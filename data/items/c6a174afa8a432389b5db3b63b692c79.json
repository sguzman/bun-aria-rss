This week on The Science of Happiness, our guest shares how he’s used humor to triumph over hardship in his life. Kerry Rudd is a former member of the Bay Area Freedom Collective, a re-entry home where formerly incarcerated people can find community and connections. He started performing comedy based on his personal experiences during the 12 years he spent in and out of the prison. Kerry shares with us how processing his experiences by writing jokes about them changes his perspective on his traumatic past and helps him cope. Later, we hear from psychologist Andrea Samson about how humor can help us  face down  some difficult situations.</p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>How to Do This Practice:</strong></p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Every day for one week, spend 10 minutes thinking about the things you found really funny that day.</p></li>\n<li><p>Write them down in as much detail as possible and describe how each of those things made you feel.
