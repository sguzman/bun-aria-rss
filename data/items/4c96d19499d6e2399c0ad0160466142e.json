  "description": "The Schiff Show continues with an Intelligence Committee report on the impeachment hearings. One fact really stands out: Schiff had records of phone calls between Trump, Giuliani, and Nunes – “likely” provided by a subpoena of AT&T. An insane Washington Post article insists that the GOP would rather side with Russia than anger Trump. Comedian Nick Di Paolo asks who’s more anti-American: Adam Schiff or Colin Kaepernick. The House Judiciary Committee’s first hearing is under way with a mixed bag of legal witnesses. Investigative reporter John Solomon describes the Left’s smear campaign against him as a distraction from the real facts. Glenn previews this weekend’s podcast with Nikki Haley: She wasn’t always a Trump fan!\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
