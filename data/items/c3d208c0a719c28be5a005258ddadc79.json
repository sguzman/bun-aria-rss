  "description": "<p>When one hears the city of Niagara mentioned, one immediately thinks of the stunning natural wonder Niagara Falls. There is much more to this western New York area and it is truly a haunted spot. One location that is rich in history and haunts is Old Fort Niagara. The Fort's history stretches back over three centuries and it initially was a key point of defense, especially during the colonial wars in North America. Several countries have held control of Fort Niagara. Fort Conti, Fort Devonville, the French Castle and finally Fort Niagara have all had homes here. The strategic importance of the Fort diminished when the Erie Canal was built, but it remained active into the 20th century. Today, it has been restored and is operated by the Old Fort Niagara Association, Inc., a not-for-profit organization, in cooperation with the New York State Office of Parks, Recreation and Historic Preservation. Tours are offered and it is a living museum. Former docent from the fort and author, podcaster and investigator Tim Shaw joins us to discuss the history and hauntings of Old Fort Niagara! The Moment in Oddity features the Delphi Purple Sapphire and This Month in History features the death of President Warren G. Harding.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here: <a href= \"https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2017/08/hgb-ep-218-old-fort-niagara.html\"> https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2017/08/hgb-ep-218-old-fort-niagara.html</a></p> <p>Sustain the podcast and become an Executive Producer: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p>Tim Shaw's website: <a href= \"http://seanthomasproductions.com\">http://seanthomasproductions.com</a></p> <p>Music:</p> <p>Vanishing from http://purple-planet.com (Moment in Oddity)<br /> In Your Arms by Kevin MacLeod http://incompetech.com (This Month in History)</p> <p>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br /> http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p> <p> </p>",
