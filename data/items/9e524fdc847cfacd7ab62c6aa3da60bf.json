  "description": "<p>Federated learning is a data decentralization privacy-preserving technique\nused to perform machine or deep learning in a secure way. In this paper we\npresent theoretical aspects about federated learning, such as the presentation\nof an aggregation operator, different types of federated learning, and issues\nto be taken into account in relation to the distribution of data from the\nclients, together with the exhaustive analysis of a use case where the number\nof clients varies. Specifically, a use case of medical image analysis is\nproposed, using chest X-Ray images obtained from an open data repository. In\naddition to the advantages related to privacy, improvements in predictions (in\nterms of accuracy, loss and area under the curve) and reduction of execution\ntimes will be studied with respect to the classical case (the centralized\napproach). Different clients will be simulated from the training data, selected\nin an unbalanced manner. The results of considering three or ten clients are\nexposed and compared between them and against the centralized case. Two\ndifferent problems related to intermittent clients are discussed, together with\ntwo approaches to be followed for each of them. Specifically, this type of\nproblems may occur because in a real scenario some clients may leave the\ntraining, and others enter it, and on the other hand because of client\ntechnical or connectivity problems. Finally, improvements and future work in\nthe field are proposed.\n</p>",
