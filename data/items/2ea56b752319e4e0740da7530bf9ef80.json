    "media:description": "You see this image of water and some atoms in your brain move around and you register what you see as water. You do not detect anything out of the ordinary when considering this water. Thus, you conclude that this water is indeed normal as there is nothing unusual about it. The irony of this chain of events is that it is in these times that man exemplifies the reasons for which one must practice the principles of reserved optimism. It is only in this way that we acknowledge the ultimate intentions they hold for us, for when judgement is unclouded, there is no longer any unconscious force that convinces us to distort what we perceive as the objective truth. The passage of time is an indifferent entity that is the benefactor of all conscientiousness, for when the ugly head of regret is reared, it is only an intangible movement that allows us to surpass the parasites who thirst for gratification that we grant sustenance to with our own thought. The deciding factor of what they eventually recognize of us is the decision we must all make between allowing ourselves to be absorbed by the careless circulation of time or becoming fixated and obsessed with what we cannot change.",
