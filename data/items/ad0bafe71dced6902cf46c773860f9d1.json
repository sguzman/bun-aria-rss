  "description": "<p>Do you ever feel overwhelmed? Do you find that your painting time is being eaten up by admin and emails and marketing and social media ... not to mention spouses and kids and parents and pets? &nbsp;Even when we love what we do, it can be stressful to cope with competing demands on our time. This week Alice is fiercely protecting her painting time despite pressure to do other things, while Louise is facing up to her tendency to put others' needs ahead of her own. &nbsp;We discuss our strategies for managing overwhelm, offer tips for prioritising what matters, and debate whether it has ever been possible for an artist to simply make their art on a full time basis. We also discuss the value of good framing and Alice shares her experience of receiving a very special letter.</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>Juiced Up Buddies group:<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/juicedupbuddies/\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/juicedupbuddies/</a></p>\n<p>RWS Contemporary 2020: <a href=\"https://www.royalwatercoloursociety.co.uk/exhibitions/36-rws-contemporary-watercolour-competition/overview/\">https://www.royalwatercoloursociety.co.uk/exhibitions/36-rws-contemporary-watercolour-competition/overview/</a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Sign up for our newsletters at:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\">bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</a></p>\n<p>Buy us a coffee at: <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\">https://ko-fi.com/artjuice</a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Follow us on Instagram:</strong></p>\n<p>Follow Alice on Instagram <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com@alicesheridanstudio/\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p>or Louise <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Credits:<br>\n</strong><em>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</em></p>\n<p><br></p>\n",
