  "description": "<p>I want to introduce you to a podcast called African Folktales. My friend Ms. JoJo takes kids on adventures all over Africa in her Magical Jeep to laugh and learn lessons with a fun twist. African Folktales are stories that are told by word of mouth through generations, so each episode is a tale that’s hundreds or even thousands of years old, but Ms. Jo Jo worked a little magic so we can all enjoy them today. Today we are going to hear two stories from Ms. Jo Jo, one called “The Happy Man” and the other called “The Pot of Wisdom”.
