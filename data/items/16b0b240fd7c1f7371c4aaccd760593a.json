  "description": "<p>Jared Carrabis makes his return to KMS to show off his nipples and tease his big announcement on Monday. Justin and Dave need to stop trying to grow their own personal brand and start working for The Kirk Minihane Show. Big Cat of Pardon My Take calls in to discuss Jared’s steroid addiction, and Dana Beers missing a coworker's wedding to go drink beer at a basketball game. The WEEI ratings are in and surprise, surprise, they stink. The calls are BACK, with Rand “Macho Man” Savage calling in to challenge The Rocket to a fight. Visionless Dave calls into the show and calls Jared a pussy for responding to a clip of him making fun of Jared’s mental health. The show ends with Jared and a Minifan going back and forth about Jared’s mental health. Kirk and Mike caught up with Gilbert Gottfried earlier in the week for a hysterical look at his career & much more.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
