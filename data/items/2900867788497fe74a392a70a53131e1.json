  "title": "Uncle Si Won't Go Fishing Alone EVER Again",
  "description": "Si's got another wild one for you, boys! It's a battle of wills as America's uncle goes up against an unrelenting 15-pound bass, but only one will emerge victorious. Willie's 49th birthday party serves up the best rib eyes and even better opportunities to throw Sadie's husband under the bus. The hilarity is nonstop as the boys talk shorty shorts on men, party meat etiquette, in-laws, people who skim sausage from a pot of gumbo, and banana and mayo sandwiches. Martin gives a shout-out to a fifth-grade entrepreneur who makes fishing baits. Stone explains how his daughter got the nickname \"Bullfrog\" from Phil Robertson. There's a good reason Vienna sausages make JD gag. And Godwin is acing his new diet, but there's one problem. \n-\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
