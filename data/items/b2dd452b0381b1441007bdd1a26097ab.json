  "description": "<p>Scott Soshnick and Michael Barr discuss a host of issues related to the business of sports, including Big 3 Chairman of the Board Amy Trask grabbing a mop and drying the court during a game. Trask, a former CEO of the NFL's Oakland Raiders, said the wet spot was bugging her so she just grabbed the mop and dried the court herself. Also discussed is Major League Baseball's decision to grant the Tampa Bay Rays permission to explore the possibility of splitting their home games between Florida and Montreal. The team has for years unsuccessfully lobbied for a new stadium. Under the proposal, the Rays would play the first part of the season in Tampa and the second half in Montreal, where business leaders are lobbying for the return of big-league baseball. Also talked about is UConn's decision to return to the Big East Conference from the American Athletic Conference. The Big East doesn't offer football. </p><p>Hosts: Scott Soshnick, Michael Barr and Eben Novy-Williams </p><p>Producer: Colin Tipton</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
