Jarvis<br/>\n     <b>category:</b>  Mathematical Physics<br/>\n     <b>type:</b>      submission<br/>\n     <b>date:</b>      2022-10-31 01:12:19 <br/>\n     <b>abstract:</b>  \nProposed here is the case for a number theory derived from a mathematical description of zero-dimensional time (as a moment) and zero-dimensional space (as a point) as the underlying mathematical information base of physical phenomena. In support of this, the proposed zero-dimensional number theory is scaled with the charge of the electron and speed of light to translate into a physical theory confirming known mathematical descriptions of physical phenomena together with proposing new mathematical descriptions for physical phenomena that physics has yet to attain by its current mathematical approach. Specifically, examined here is how this process of physical theory formulation prescribes the contemporary ideas of information, energy, efficiency, and intelligence. By such, the modern scientific method is examined and found both problematic and limited in attempting to relate numbers and geometry directly to physical phenomena. Proposed here therefore is the case for the zero-dimensional number theory as the core mathematical information base of physical phenomena as per its indirect physical phenomenal route of mathematical and geometric execution.\n  \n   "
