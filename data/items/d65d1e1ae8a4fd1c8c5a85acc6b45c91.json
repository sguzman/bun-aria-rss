  "description": "<p>Meditation: Intimacy with Life (2018-05-09) - This guided meditation begins with a body scan, bringing the friendliness of a smile into the body, and waking up our awareness of aliveness.

Our reminders are to wake up from trance by reopening to our senses, allowing for a true intimacy with the life that lives through us.<br /></p>",
