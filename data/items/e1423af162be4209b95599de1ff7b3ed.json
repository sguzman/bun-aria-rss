  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, in America there are those that do and those that don't do, and Gov Ron DeSantis is already preparing linemen ready to restore power as soon as the winds subside. Craftsmen and laborers, both men and women of every race and background, from all over the U.S are prepared to go to Florida to assist with the aftermath of the hurricane and provide immediate recovery. This is the spirit of America! Then, there are over one million people currently without electricity in Florida. Imagine if electricity were the only source of energy? The infrastructure to live off electricity as our sole source of energy does not exist and the so-called climate change agenda must be stopped. People aren't dying in Chicago because of a lack of gun control the same way we're not having a hurricane because of climate change. Later, retired Naval Officer Hung Cao calls in to discuss his campaign for Congress in Virginia's 10th District. Cao's incumbent opponent voted for the Inflation Reduction Act twice and is a puppet of Nancy Pelosi. Afterward, Congressman Byron Donalds who represents the part of Florida getting pummeled by Hurricane Ian calls in with an update. Donalds reports that the storm is slowing down as of Wednesday night but given its strength and width the damage caused will still be quite an impact. Donalds added that Gov. DeSantis and the Florida Emergency Management team are highly coordinated and prepared. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
