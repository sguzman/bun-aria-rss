    "media:description": "Dr. Peterson's extensive catalog is available now on DailyWire+: https://utm.io/ueSXh\n\nDr. Jordan B. Peterson and Senator Josh Hawley discuss the leftist ideology surrounding men and their diminished worth, the current Republican swing as a result, and the potential future of American politics as we move towards the midterm elections.\n\nSenator Hawley is recognized as one of the nation’s leading constitutional lawyers. He has litigated at the Supreme Court of the United States, the federal courts of appeals, and in state court, fighting for the people’s liberties. He previously fought Obamacare at the Supreme Court — and won — as one of the lead attorneys in the landmark Hobby Lobby case. Since taking office in 2019, Senator Hawley has been a leading champion in Congress for working families. He’s worked across the aisle to deliver protections for kids online, led the fight for direct payments to working people during the COVID-19 pandemic, and taken steps to crack down on predatory landlords. Currently, Senator Hawley is writing a book set for a 2023 release.\n\n_______________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________________\n\n— Links — \n\nFor Senator Josh Hawley\n\nTwitter  https://twitter.com/HawleyMO\n\nSenate page website https://www.hawley.senate.gov/ \n\nPersonal Website https://joshhawley.com/ \n\n— Sponsors —\n\nBirch Gold: Text \"JORDAN\" to 989898 for your no-cost, no-obligation, FREE information kit\n\nDr. Peterson's new book: The ABC of Childhood Tragedy.
