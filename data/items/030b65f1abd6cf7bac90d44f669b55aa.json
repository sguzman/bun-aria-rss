  "description": "Our audiobook this week is Belong to Me by Lucy Darling!\n\nNarrated by Mackenzie Cartwright and Lance Greenfield\n\nSome things never change, I think as I listen to my sister’s crazy idea. There is no way this will work. We may have been able to pull off the old switcheroo when we were younger, but I doubt it will work now. Even though we’re identical twins, we are far from the same. I work from home and keep to myself while she works a corporate job and deals with an overbearing boss. Yet, I know without a doubt that I’m going to agree to her crazy plan.\n\nPretend to be her for a week was the favor she’d asked for. It would be easy, she said. Her boss would never notice, she insisted. I beg to differ. It’s only day one, and all he seems to notice is me.\n\nHe doesn’t want me as his assistant. He wants me in his bed permanently. He says I belong to him, but is it me or my sister that he’s claiming?\n\nRETURN TO ME by Lucy Darling: http://readmeromance.com/books/lucy-darling/\n\nLucy Darling Newsletter (subscribe for a freebie!): https://authorlucydarling.com/newsletter/\n\nBELONG TO ME by Lucy Darling: https://amzn.to/32EknbS\n\nRETURN TO ME by Lucy Darling: https://amzn.to/32DucqK\n\nATLAS by Shaw Hart: https://amzn.to/38aYnXy\n\nLucy Darling GIVEAWAY: http://readmeromance.com\n\nFollow Read Me Romance on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/readmeromance/?hl=en\n\nJoin Read Me Romance Headquarters on FB: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1681258945313004/\n\nFind Alexa Riley on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/authoralexariley/\n\nFind Tessa Bailey on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/tessabaileyisanauthor/\n\nPodcast Credits\nRead Me Romance Theme Song by L.B.
