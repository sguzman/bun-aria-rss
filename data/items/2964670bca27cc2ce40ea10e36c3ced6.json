  "description": "Psychotherapy is a form of treatment for human suffering that is increasingly misunderstood by the people who seek it. Once the dominant force in psychology, it now gets confused with or supplanted by shorter, more symptom-focused treatments preferred by health insurance companies. True psychotherapy, according to author and psychotherapist Jo Frasca, takes its time in unraveling and healing the archaic wounds that cause our most troubling symptoms. In her book Delving Deeper: Understanding Diverse Approaches while Exploring Psychotherapy, she uses anecdotes and lessons from her years of clinical practice to clarify how psychotherapy differs from psychiatry, social work, counseling, and other treatments, and she offers a compelling argument for the unique rewards of a well-conducted psychotherapeutic treatment. In our interview, we discuss what motivated her to put these convictions into book form and her suggestions for how to find high-quality, effective treatments.\n\nJo Frasca is a psychotherapist in private practice in Sydney, Australia, combining Transactional Analysis and the relational model in her work, informed by psychoanalytic theory and thinking. Follow her on Twitter and Instagram.\n\n\n\nEugenio Duarte is a licensed psychologist and psychoanalyst practicing in New York City. He treats individuals and couples, with specialties in LGBTQ issues, eating and body image problems, and relationship problems. Follow him on Twitter and Instagram.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
