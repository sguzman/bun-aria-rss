  "description": "On Wednesday’s Mark Levin Show broadcasting from Israel, Ambassador David Friedman joins the program at the CBN studios in Jerusalem. Amb. Friedman says that the U.S stands much to benefit from such a strategic partnership with the State of Israel and its intelligence services. More Americans are alive today because of the intelligence-sharing between the U.S and the IDF/Mossad intelligence agencies. In fact, Bill Ford of the Ford Motor Company says that the high technology industry in Tel Aviv provides more flexibility than some tech hubs in the States. Then, Dore Gold, President of the Jerusalem Center of Public Affairs joins Mark. Ancient Iran, or Persia, spanned a greater distance than their boundaries dictate today. Iran sees itself as a truncated version of its former self. Due to their commercial trading interests, Europeans turn a blind eye to Iran's ambition to lay claim to Syria, Bahrain, and many other territories. Therefore, the United States and Israel pose the greatest threat to Iran's aggression in the region primarily through proxy groups like Hezbollah. Afterward, being historically accurate is important. Whether it's being right about Betsy Ross and the flag or correcting Sen. Kamala Harris on bussing. People risk their lives to come to America as imperfect as it is. The fact is, is that neither Colin Kaepernick nor Kamala Harris have done anything to advance America with their divisive racialist rhetoric. The Declaration of independence and the U.S Constitution are documents that uphold the rights of the individual, all individuals, including African Americans. Kamala Harris’ surrogates are tripping over themselves on whether Harris is actually African-American. Even CNN's Dom Lemon understands this better than most Democrats. The left has become so dependent on the pigmentation of identity politics that they can't even keep it straight amongst themselves.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
