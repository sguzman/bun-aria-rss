  "description": "Harvey Schwartz, president and co-COO of Goldman Sachs, took a year off after high school, though it wasn't part of any kind of grand plan - he readily admits there wasn't one. But it did introduce him to his first mentor, and the concept of investing in other people's success that has been a defining theme of his three decades in finance. He shares how his path has evolved over the course of his career and his thoughts on today's market environment.\n\n\nThis podcast was recorded on October 3, 2017.\n\n\nThis podcast should not be copied, distributed, published or reproduced, in whole or in part.
