  "title": "#308 - The Killing Of A Bad Man - Hooksett, New Hampshire",
  "description": "<p>This week, in Hooksett, New Hampshire, a man falls dead, in front of other people, and they think it must be a heart attack, until they find the pool of blood, under him, and a hole in his chest. Was it a hunter's stray bullet, from the nearby woods, or something much more sinister? He turns out to have quite the past, since his mother was burned to death, in the family pig sty. The reality sets in that he wasn't killed by accident, and there are many suspects. Was it an enemy of his brother & a simple case of mistaken identity? Or maybe one of the husbands of the many married women he was fooling around with, or a family member of one of the teenage girls he was dating? Or was it something even darker, that we know nothing about???</p><p><br></p><p>Along the way, we find out that Hot Dog on a Stick employees don't have to look like actual hot dog on sticks, that the past can come back to haunt you, even if you thought it was over, and that you shouldn't offer to murder anybody, without being asked first!!</p><p><br></p><p>Hosted by James Pietragallo and Jimmie Whisman</p><p><br></p><p>New episodes every Thursday!</p><p><br></p><p>Donate at: patreon.com/crimeinsports or go to paypal.com and use our email: crimeinsports@gmail.com</p><p>Go to shutupandgivememurder.com for all things Small Town Murder & Crime In Sports!</p><p><br></p><p>Follow us on...</p><p><br></p><p>twitter.com/@murdersmall</p><p>facebook.com/smalltownpod</p><p>instagram.com/smalltownmurder</p><p><br></p><p>Also, check out James & Jimmie's other show, Crime In Sports!
