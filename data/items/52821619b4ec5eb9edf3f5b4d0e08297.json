  "description": "We kick off this week’s show with our favorite design books, and what better time to start reading then now, while we are all still at home? Then, we welcome designer Jena Salmon from Atlanta to talk about her style that incorporates classic and traditional with a little funk. Jena discusses her love of color, how novices can get started with bold choices that will stand the test of time, tips and tricks for wallpaper, and ways to mix in traditional older pieces with modern furniture and design.\nWhat You’ll Hear On This Episode:\n\nOur top books in design for beginners, fancy homes, “normals”, and everyone in between!\n\nDesign books can be an investment themselves, but they are a great accessory and also make for great gifts and trading.\n\nJena’s style is funky, but also classic and traditional. She shares how just using one acrylic or contemporary piece out of context can make a big difference.\n\nHow to choose colors that are bold but stand the test of time.\n\nAn inner glimpse at a Frank Lloyd Wright inspired house that Jena is working on, and how she captures the client’s requests with the overall architecture of a home.\n\nHow we can save money and time by using wallpaper in the most efficient ways.\n\nWhy Jena chose blue and tile tile, and how this can create classic neutrality also found in plain white kitchens.\n\nWhat happens with showrooms after they are done, and why a designer would want to do one.\n\n\nMentioned In This Episode:\nHabitat by Lauren\nTom Scheerer\nNo Place Like Home - by Madeline Stuart\nVacation at Home - by Vern Yip\nModern Mix by Eddie Ross and Jaithan Kochar\nBunny Williams\nOne Man’s Folly by Furlow Gatewood\nGil Schafer\nSoul of the Home - by Tara Shaw\nThe Art of Place - by Lee Ledbetter\nThe Big Book of Chic - by Miles Redd\nJena Salmon\n@jenasalmon\nDecorating Dilemma:\nThank you for writing in! We would make sure everything is painted the same color and in flat paint so there is not a lot of reflection. Since you have young children, they are going to need a place to play and a TV above the fireplace will work here. Check out our Coventry Benches that would provide some great space for storage and also additional seating options. A solid tall piece of furniture could also be used for storage without competing with color. Behind the sofa, a drop leaf table could be a great option for eating and more storage. Great for kids and it will soon serve as your new dining room table/drop space for walking in the door, etc!\nFind all of the Show Notes at Ballarddesigns.com/podcast",
