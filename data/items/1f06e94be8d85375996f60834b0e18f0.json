  "description": "<p>Is it possible that some people who we think are mentally ill are actually victims of demonic possession?  One psychiatrist says yes.  Another psychiatrist says no - believing this is true is a matter of not carefully thinking about what you see and hear from others.  In this episode I break down the claims made by Richard Gallagher and a counterpoint to Gallagher which was written by Steven Novella.  Along the way we'll learn about logical fallacies such as the \"argument for incredulity\" and the \"argument of ignorance\".  I think you'll find this fascinating and I'd love to hear your thoughts on this.</p>",
