  "description": "Welcome back to another episode of Frankly Speaking! Today's show opens up with talks about the transportation and logistics markets. The numbers show Amazon (AMZN) is now a logistics titan - with still plenty of room for growth. Tune in to hear what this means for competitors like FedEx (FDX) and UPS (UPS). I then touch base on Apple's (AAPL) political landscape. Let me tell you - \"What they say and what they do are two totally different things.\" Today's show covers Apple's only risk investors need to be aware of. In addition, I break down the top 3 financial stories from 2016. Each story comes with a lesson we must carryover into the new year. This includes lessons from consumer sentiment, the Trump election, and today's volatility. To end the episode, I tell listeners why 2017 should be a turnaround year for Uranium. This is one of my favorite plays for the new year. Also, can Northern Dynasty (NAK) get any higher? Special thanks to Tom, John, Derek, and Brad. 2016 has been one for the books. Thanks for tuning in and for all the great questions. Keep them coming! I read them all. Other stocks mentioned: AT&T (T), General Electric (GE), JPMorgan Chase (JPM), McDonalds (MCD), Wal-Mart (WMT), Nike (NKE), Kinder Morgan (KMI), IBM (IBM), Teva Pharmaceuticals (TEVA), and Chipotle (CMG). PS - Be sure to follow me next week on . As mentioned, I have media access to the 2017 CES. Don't miss a beat. See you next year!",
