  "description": "<p>I accidentally downloaded a Christian audio book but still managed to glean some wisdom about perfectionism before the endless bible quotes sent me running. Why is everyone else seemingly doing \"it\" right but me? I have a theory. All the great psychological truths are in Sesame Street.  I grew up in an era where girls were told they could be secretaries or hairdressers - how does one transcend societal norms?! An emailer asks if it's possible that he's already gotten his life at just 24 years old?  An overweight bro asks how to lose weight. I divulge my foolproof post-baby French methods. Such a big episode, let's get it alllllll, bros! </p>\n",
