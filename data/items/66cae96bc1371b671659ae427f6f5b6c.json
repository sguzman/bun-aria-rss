  "description": "<p>Author Timothy Renner returns to the show to talk about his new book Bigfoot: West Coast Wild Men: A History of Wild Men, Gorillas, and Other Hairy Monsters in California, Oregon, and Washington state.</p> <p>Most of you remember Tim when he was on the last show and shared historical encounters from his book <a href= \"https://www.amazon.com/Bigfoot-Pennsylvania-Wild-Men-Gorillas-Monsters/dp/154551397X/ref=sr_1_2?s=books&ie=UTF8&qid=1515267459&sr=1-2\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bigfoot in Pennsylvania: A History of Wild-Men</a>.</p> <p>Tim writes \"The last time I was on it was to talk about my book Bigfoot in Pennsylvania - which included the historical newspaper accounts of the creatures from the 1800s through the early 1900s in PA. As you suggested at that time, I compiled reports from the NW and I have published my next book in what looks to be a series: <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/dp/1983434094/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Bigfoot: West Coast Wild Men</a> This book covers reports from the 1850s through the 1920s in CA, OR, and WA.</p> <p>This book contains one of the single best bigfoot descriptions I think I've ever read (the result of hunters killing a creature and describing the body in detail - but there's a lot more to the story - it's fantastic); as well as some really interesting reports of \"wild gorillas\" in CA, attacks in OR, and a creature which appeared on the campus of the University of Washington multiple times.</p> <p>I love Sasquatch Chronicles because of the witness reports - which I believe are the best source of information regarding bigfoot creatures - and these old articles often read like witness reports. The descriptions of not only the creatures but their behavior mirrors reports we hear on SC today and these articles are well over 100 years old in most cases.\"</p>",
