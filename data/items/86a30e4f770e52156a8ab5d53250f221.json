  "description": "<p>It’s probably going to be hard, but waking up earlier this year can help you to get your personal finances in order! We’re excited to talk with our friend 5am Joel about how he got started waking up early and how this has impacted him personally. We both met Joel at a personal finance conference and immediately bonded over a mutual love of craft beer as well as talking about nerdy money things like investing in real estate and financial independence. He’s been waking up early for years now and we’re curious to hear how he does it so that we can begin implementing some of his tips into our daily routine as well.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Black House by Modern Times Beer- another big thanks to our friend Craig there at the brewery for donating this one!
