  "description": "When you see a 45 year old bourbon priced at $1800 retail, do you ask yourself, \"Who are they kidding!?\". That's exactly what Kenny thought before sitting down with our guest today. James \"Buddy\" Thompson brings more to this story than a bottle of bourbon. He was the Forman chairman of Glenmore Distillery and donated over $300,000 from the profits of James Thompson & Brother Final Reserve to charities that support Veterans. This episode will capture not only the history of Glenmore Distillery, but also make you intrigued to know what something that has aged 45 years in an oak barrel tastes like and the journey those barrels took until they were actually bottled.
