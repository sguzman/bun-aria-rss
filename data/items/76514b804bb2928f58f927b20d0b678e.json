  "description": "I describe mechanisms by which deliberate cold exposure can enhance mental health, physical health, and performance. I detail specific protocols to safely engage in deliberate cold exposure, including minimal exposure times, time-of-day effects, determining optimal temperatures, recovery, mindset, and movement during cold exposure. I discuss how cold exposure can be used to safely stress the body to improve attention, mood, and cognitive focus and boost metabolism and reduce inflammation. Also, I explain how cold exposure on specific regions of the body (called glabrous skin surfaces) can be leveraged to enhance endurance and weight training and increase work output.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Deliberate Cold Exposure, Health Warning\n(00:04:23) Tool: Moderate Exercise & Cognitive Work\n(00:11:32) Sponsors\n(00:15:37) Circadian Rhythm & Body Temperature\n(00:18:41) Tool: Quickly Decrease Core Body Temperature, Glabrous Skin\n(00:25:26) Mental Effects of Cold Exposure\n(00:29:02) Physical Effects of Cold Exposure\n(00:30:11) How Cold Should the Temperature Be?\n(00:34:53) Cold Showers vs. Cold Water Immersion\n(00:38:27) Protocols for Cold Exposure\n(00:50:57) Optimal Mindset(s) During Cold Exposure\n(00:55:26) Tool: Using Movement During Cold Exposure\n(00:57:51) Optimal Frequency of Cold Exposure\n(01:00:22) Cold Exposure for Dopamine, Mood & Focus\n(01:12:55) Cold Exposure & Metabolism, Brown Fat\n(01:25:55) Tool: Caffeine, Dopamine & Cold Exposure\n(01:29:14) Tools: Increasing Metabolism w/Cold – The Søberg Principle, Shivering\n(01:34:15) Norepinephrine & Fat Cells\n(01:36:22) Cold, Physical Performance, Inflammation\n(01:47:36) Hyperthermia & Glabrous Skin Cooling\n(01:53:27) Tool: Palmar Cooling & Endurance\n(02:03:18) Cold Exposure to Groin, Increasing Testosterone\n(02:07:50) Tool: Optimal Timing for Daily Cold Exposure\n(02:11:16) Neural Network Newsletter, Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify Reviews, Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Supplements, Instagram, Twitter\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",
