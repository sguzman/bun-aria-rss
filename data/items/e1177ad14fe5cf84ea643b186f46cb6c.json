The homework assignment was assigned to students in pairs; a boy with a girl. Angela’s partner bailed on the project so she was working alone. She walked from her home on Main Street to the woods behind Peekskill’s Hillcrest Elementary School where she was assaulted and murdered.</p><p>https://www.deskovicfoundation.org/</p><p>Support us and get extras by visiting:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://patreon.com/generationwhy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">patreon.com/generationwhy</a></p><p>Listen ad free with Wondery+.
