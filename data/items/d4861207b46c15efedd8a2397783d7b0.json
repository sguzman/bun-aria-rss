  "description": "On Tuesday’s Mark Levin show, Brian Mudd from WIOD fills in for Mark. This Brett Kavanaugh accusation isn’t really about him, it’s that this tactic can happen to any of us. Under our laws the alleged crime is beyond the statute of limitations and if he is guilty nothing will come of it legally except his life would be ruined. If you care about your family, kids, and our system of government you’d better get out and vote in the midterms. President Trump should scare the media and threaten to nominate Mark Levin if Kavanaugh doesn't go through his confirmation. Then, Democrats should be held accountable for their transgressions with a \"30 count indictment\" wish-list. Calling out the co-conspirators from the Devin Nunes memo for conspiring to derail a candidate for the presidency by abusing federal law enforcement and spying apparatus.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
