  "description": "<p>You would never go to a toy store for a gala dress, so why do you stay with someone who’s afraid of commitment, when you’re looking for a life partner? Why do you seek validation from a parent, when they’ve never once approved of your choices? In this episode, I’ll teach you how to stop seeking validation, love, and approval from people who will never give it to you - and how to give it to yourself, instead.</p> <p>Get full show notes and more information here: <a href= \"https://unfuckyourbrain.com/153\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">https://unfuckyourbrain.com/153</a></p>",
