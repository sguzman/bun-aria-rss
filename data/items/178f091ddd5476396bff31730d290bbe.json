In this episode, Emily and Laura kickoff our RM month of education with the first of four podcast shows on schooling choices! Deciding how to educate your child reveals a lot of options, opinions, and pressures from both inside and outside of your home. We hope you’ll join us over the next month while we talk about private, public, and homeschooling, and how the gospel gives us freedom to choose, in the context of our own situation, for the glory of God.</p> </div> </div> <div id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1520349096103_1220\" class=\"row sqs-row\"> <div class=\"col sqs-col-3 span-3\"> </div> <div class=\"col sqs-col-3 span-3\"> <div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1520347259672_25375\" class= \"sqs-block button-block sqs-block-button\" data-block-type=\"53\"> <div id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1520349096103_498\" class=\"sqs-block-content\"> <div id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1520349096103_497\" class= \"sqs-block-button-container--center\" style=\"text-align: center;\" data-alignment=\"center\" data-button-size=\"small\"><a class= \"sqs-block-button-element--small sqs-block-button-element\" href= \"https://risenmotherhood.squarespace.com/show-archive/ep-93-how-should-we-educate-our-children-the-case-for-freedom-part-1#rm-apply\" data-initialized=\"true\">RM APPLY QUESTIONS</a></div> <div class=\"sqs-block-button-container--center\" style= \"text-align: center;\" data-alignment=\"center\" data-button-size= \"small\"> </div> </div> </div> </div> <div id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1520349096103_1219\" class= \"col sqs-col-3 span-3\"> <div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1520347259672_27180\" class= \"sqs-block button-block sqs-block-button\" data-block-type=\"53\"> <div id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1520349096103_505\" class=\"sqs-block-content\"> <div id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1520349096103_504\" class= \"sqs-block-button-container--center\" style=\"text-align: center;\" data-alignment=\"center\" data-button-size=\"small\"><a id= \"yui_3_17_2_1_1520349096103_1218\" class= \"sqs-block-button-element--small sqs-block-button-element\" href= \"https://risenmotherhood.squarespace.com/transcriptions/ep-93-how-should-we-educate-our-children-the-case-for-freedom-part-1-transcript\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\" data-initialized=\"true\" name= \"yui_3_17_2_1_1520349096103_1218\">VIEW TRANSCRIPT</a></div> </div> </div> </div> <div class=\"col sqs-col-3 span-3\"> </div> </div> <div id=\"block-yui_3_17_2_1_1520347259672_28891\" class= \"sqs-block html-block sqs-block-html\" data-block-type=\"2\"> <div id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1520349096103_1260\" class= \"sqs-block-content\"> <p><strong>Articles, Resources and Related Content:</strong></p> <p><em>We have a special place to find our collection of education resources this month! <a href= \"http://www.risenmotherhood.com/education\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Here</a> you’ll find links to all of the interviews, resources</em> <em>and</em> <em>tools we’ve found helpful, and the RM questionnaire to serve as a springboard of things to think about as you and your family consider the decision of how to educate your child.</em></p> <p>Below, you’ll find some episode-specific resources:</p> <ul id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1520349096103_1259\" dir=\"ltr\"> <li id=\"yui_3_17_2_1_1520349096103_1258\">Deuteronomy 6:4-9: “Hear, O Israel: The Lord our God, the Lord is one. You shall love the Lord your God with all your heart and with all your soul and with all your might.
