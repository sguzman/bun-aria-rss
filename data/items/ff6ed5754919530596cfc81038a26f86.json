  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, Attorney General Merrick Garland has no authority to label parents that protest as domestic terrorists and use the FBI to silence them. The letter from the National School Boards Association smacks of an inside job to help the Federal government further nationalize its reach into local communities. The Biden administration wants to strike fear in the hearts of parents and community members who dare assemble to question their government. If they succeed, the public will have ceded our children, our future, and our liberty to the Marxist left. Then, Manhattan Institute Senior fellow Chris Rufo calls in and explains that this is simply an outrageous attempt to politicize the DOJ even further and prosecute parents for protesting under the Patriot Act. This is a suppression tactic to infringe upon one's Constitutional right to free speech and assembly similar to how the Obama administration used the IRS to stifle conservatives in the Tea Party movement in 2010. Later, Victor Davis Hanson, author of \"The Dying Citizen: How Progressive Elites, Tribalism, and Globalization Are Destroying the Idea of America\" joins the show to explain the fragility of citizenship. The destruction of the middle class, border security, the administrative state, and academia are contributing to the demise of American citizenship.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
