  "description": "November 2017: Update and goodbye I&rsquo;ve decided to shut down Bandcamp Recommender (BCRecommender), despite hearing back from a few volunteers. The main reasons are:\nBandcamp now shows album recommendations at the bottom of album pages. While this isn&rsquo;t quite the same as BCRecommender, I hope that it will evolve to a more comprehensive recommender system. I tried to contact Bandcamp to get their support for the continued running of BCRecommender. I have not heard back from them."
