Is there a part of you that worries excessively, trying to outsmart the future? Maybe there’s a part that overeats, trying to stuff down big feelings … or a controlling part that’s addicted to work. If you can relate to any of this, you are not alone! Internal Family Systems (IFS) therapy teaches us that we all have “protector” parts working valiantly to keep us safe. But true safety comes when we can help these parts relax. Today’s Dear Gabby offers a beautiful guided meditation that will let you do just that.</span><br /></span></div> <div class=\"gmail_default\"><span style= \"font-family: arial, sans-serif;\"> </span></div> <div class=\"gmail_default\"> <p dir=\"ltr\">The following are helpful resources and books I mention in the episode: </p> <span style=\"font-family: arial, sans-serif;\"><br /></span> <p dir=\"ltr\">To learn more about IFS, listen to <a href= \"https://bit.ly/3xaDQkX\">my Dear Gabby BIG TALK with IFS founder Dick Schwartz</a> and <a href=\"https://bit.ly/3RI7Z3e\">my live talk about the Self-to-part connection</a>. <a href= \"https://bit.ly/3xaDQkX\">https://bit.ly/3xaDQkX</a></p> <span style=\"font-family: arial, sans-serif;\"><br /></span> <p dir=\"ltr\">Want even more support?
