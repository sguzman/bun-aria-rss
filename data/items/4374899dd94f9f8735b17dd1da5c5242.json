  "description": "<p>Are you really living up to your potential?</p> <p>Do you have goals, passions, and aspirations that are slowly dying because you are not taking action on them?</p> <p>No matter where you are in your life right now, things can and will be improved if you have the audacity to take a new action.</p> <p>You’ve probably heard the saying, “If you keep doing what you’re doing, you’re going to keep getting what you’re getting.”</p> <p>It’s a simple principle about life that if you want something new, then it requires a new action. Break the old pattern, and you can instantly see change.</p> <p>Now, it’s not just the action that gets you there… The action is actually an end result of something far more powerful. The action comes from who you are - the mindset you carry, and who you believe yourself to be.</p> <p>This is my distinguished guest’s specialty… Helping you to get inside and change the beliefs you carry about yourself. Helping you to identify where you’ve been holding back… where you’ve been feeding yourself a disempowering story… and how to change it.</p> <p>Today we are honored to have on Eric Thomas, Phd - better known to his fans all over the world as ET!</p> <p>Not only is he a critically acclaimed author and internationally renowned speaker, but he’s also one of the most sought after voices of positive empowerment online. So much so that his time is regularly requested by huge brands like the NFL ,the NBA, and AT&T because he is truly such a difference maker.</p> <p>I can’t even begin to tell you how powerful this episode is…</p> <p>If you are ever in need of a breakthrough, simply click play on this episode and Eric will help you get there.</p> <h2>In this episode you'll discover:</h2> <ul> <li>How Eric went from being homeless to impacting the lives of millions.</li> <li>What it means to “fail forward”.</li> <li>Why up-leveling our environment and the people in our lives is entirely up to us.</li> <li>What you can use to start changing your mindset and get clear on your vision.</li> <li>Why every - single - step is important in getting you to your goal.</li> <li>Why a consistent routine is crucial for success.</li> <li>How to get more rejuvenative sleep in less time each night.</li> <li>How to create real consistency in your life.</li> <li>Why self-honesty is important for your growth.</li> <li>What Eric does to maintain his power and energy (many of these things will sounds strangely familiar!)</li> <li>How your story controls your life (and how you can change it!)</li> </ul> <h2>Items mentioned in this episode include:</h2> <p>* <a href=\"https://themodelhealthshow.com/onnit\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Onnit.com/Model</a> <== Get your optimal health & performance supplements at 10% off!<br /> * <a href= \"http://theshawnstevensonmodel.com/bob-proctor/\">Interview with Bob Proctor - The Model Health Show</a><br /> * <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/user/etthehiphoppreacher\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">ET on YouTube</a><br /> * Dr. Thomas - The Album ( <a href= \"https://itunes.apple.com/us/album/dr.-thomas/id1021805562?ls=1/?at=10laRb\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Apple Podcasts</a> / <a href= \"http://www.amazon.com/Dr-Thomas-Eric/dp/B012J9WWI2/ref=sr_1_1?s=dmusic&ie=UTF8&qid=1438089790&sr=1-1&keywords=eric+thomas+dr.+thomas\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Amazon</a> ) <== This album is a must have!</p> <p>Thank you so much for checking out this episode of The Model Health Show.
