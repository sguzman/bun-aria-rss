  "description": "<p>How many times have you wanted to remember a joke at a party but you just can't?  Well, there IS a way to remember jokes and I have got 4 jokes to tell you along with a mnemonic that will help you remember all 4 of them.  I challenge you to listen to these 4 jokes, then listen to my mnemonic and then wait a little while and go through the mnemonic and I guarantee that you'll remember all 4 jokes.  </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Remembering anything for more than a few minutes requires not only repetition, but also something else that will make the to-be-remembered thing stick in your head. That thing can be a mnemonic device.  In this episode I'll use a combination of the keyword technique, crazy images and a modified approach to the method of loci.  I'll use your body to help you remember these jokes.  Let's have some fun.</p>",
