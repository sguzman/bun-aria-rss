I have always been fascinated by this band from their meteoric rise to capture the attention of the early 2000's metalcore/Christian scenes and moving quickly onto the Warped Tour stages across the country...the band definitely always had something to say. Now, heading into the bands 16th year of existence, they keep pushing their comfort zones and evolving. Mike and I discuss his process of writing a book, detaching his ego from his position in the band and so much more.
