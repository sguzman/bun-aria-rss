He was both praised and attacked for his flexibility, adapting to the reigns of Protestant and Catholic monarchs and, under Elizabeth, his goal was to make England strong, stable and secure from attack from its neighbours. He sought control over Ireland and persuaded Elizabeth that Mary Queen of Scots must die, yet often counselled peace rather than war in the interests of prosperity. \n\nWith \n\nDiarmaid MacCulloch\nProfessor of the History of the Church at the University of Oxford\n\nSusan Doran\nProfessor of Early Modern British History at the University of Oxford\n\nand \n\nJohn Guy\nFellow of Clare College, University of Cambridge\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson",
