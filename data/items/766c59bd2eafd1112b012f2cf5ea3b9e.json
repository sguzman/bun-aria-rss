  "description": "<p>In the debut episode of Straight Fire with Jason McIntyre, Jason explains why the impending cancellation of the college football season stems from a lack of leadership both at the top of the NCAA (1:44) and the Power 5 conferences as a whole (7:06). He also tells us why it's time for the NCAA to do away with the term 'amateurism' once and for all (8:18), and why he doesn't begrudge Clemson star quarterback Trevor Lawrence for wanting to play the season because the young signal caller just can't see the forest through the trees (11:03). Plus, Jason does a deep dive into the weekend that was inside the NBA Bubble, and tells us why you shouldn't panic about the Los Angeles Lakers, Los Angeles Clippers and the Milwaukee Bucks all taking losses (16:53), why history tells us that Kawhi Leonard isn't in the same stratosphere as LeBron James as a player (21:49), and makes a very interesting comparison between Luka Doncic and James Harden (25:51). Finally, Jason helps you make a little money at the sportsbook as he hands out his Best Bet of the night for Monday's NBA slate (30:23).</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
