  "description": "<p>The media fervor currently swirling the pandemic is a fever of conflicting data and performative politics. Black and white, it's either sequester ad infinitum or back to work now — a conversation devoid of nuance.</p><p>How to discern fact from fiction? Separate opinion from data? Politics from perspective?</p><p>Like me, I suspect you're frustrated — yearning for evidence-based answers over conjecture; considered strategy over confusion; and objectivity over punditry.</p><p>I can’t tell you when this alternate reality (which has morphed into a distorted normality) will cease. What I can offer is the experience and perception of one of the best and brightest in public health and preventive medicine.</p><p>Meet <strong>David L. Katz, MD, MPH FACPM, FACP, FACLM.</strong></p><p>A pioneering voice in functional lifestyle medicine, David is a graduate of Dartmouth, the Albert Einstein College of Medicine & Yale School of Public Health. In addition, he is the founding director of Yale University’s Yale-Griffen Prevention Research Center, a past-president of the American College of Lifestyle Medicine, and the founder & president of the True Health Initiative, a non-profit coalition of more than 500 world-renowned physicians, scientists, and nutrition experts (including myself, the least qualified member of this coalition) committed to establishing and communicating a growing scientific consensus on the optimal diet for human beings and the planet.</p><p>The recipient of 3 honorary doctorates, David was also a James Beard Award nominee in 2019 for health journalism, has contributed countless articles to top medical journals along with op-eds in The New York Times and other magazines, and somehow found the time to write 17 books, including his latest, <em>How To Eat, </em>which he co-authored with the great Mark Bittman.</p><p>Although David has been a prominent voice in nutrition science and lifestyle medicine for many years, the pandemic has suddenly foisted him into a very bright spotlight.</p><p>Currently making the major media rounds, you might have caught one of his recent appearances on <em>Real Time With Bill Maher, CNN </em>or<em> Fox News, </em>where he's been&nbsp;advocating for a more data-driven, targeted public health response to coronavirus.</p><p>It's a strategy he calls vertical interdiction. It's (strangely) controversial. And it's the focus of today’s conversation — a nuanced discourse on improving how we consider and navigate the landmines of this unique global predicament.</p><p>I appreciate David's thoughtful perspective and his commitment to service (including treating COVID-19 patients on the outbreak frontlines in the Bronx). He’s eloquent and data-driven. Evidence-based and no-nonsense. And quite charming to boot.</p><p>To anyone suffering from the virus or the effects of it, my heart goes out to you. This pandemic is hurting us all, some in more catastrophic ways than others.&nbsp;I hope Dr. Katz’s words bring you comfort — he gets as close as he can to providing us with the answers we are all so desperately seeking.</p><p>The visually inclined can watch it go down on YouTube. And as always, the audio version streams wild and free on <a href=\"https://bit.ly/rrpitunes\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Podcasts</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bit.ly/rrpspotify\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Spotify.</a></p><p>It’s an honor to share his perspective with all of you today. May you receive it with an open mind and heart.</p><p>Peace + Plants,</p><p>Rich</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
