  "description": "<p>On today’s episode of The Literary Life podcast, our fearless hosts discuss Oscar Wilde’s unraveling of the tangle of plot points in Act 3 of <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3craQbZ\">The Importance of Being Earnest</a></em>. Cindy Rollins talks about her reaction to Act 3 and how it gets resolved. Thomas Banks observes how Wilde sets up the conflict with the possibility to become a tragedy like <em>Oedipus Rex</em> instead of a comedy. Angelina Stanford talks about the theme of the identity quest, tokens of identity and foundlings in literature. The conversation, as in previous episodes, centers around the way Wilde pokes fun at Victorian ideals and cliches.</p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>Wear your learning like your watch, in a private pocket; and do not pull it out and strike it merely to show that you have one.</p> <cite>Lord Chesterfield</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>We must travel this path as lovers, amateurs, of the Word and of words because all things reveal themselves more truly to the eyes of love.</p> <cite>Stratford Caldecott</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>Time’s glory is to calm contending kings,</p> <p>To unmask falsehood, and bring truth to light, To stamp the seal of time in aged things, To wake the morn and sentinel the night, To wrong the wronger till he render right; To ruinate proud buildings with thy hours, And smear with dust their glittering golden towers.</p> <cite>William Shakespeare</cite></blockquote> <h3>Easter Wings</h3> <p><em>by George Herbert</em></p> <p>Lord, who createdst man in wealth and store,<br />      Though foolishly he lost the same,<br />            Decaying more and more,<br />                  Till he became<br />                        Most poore:<br />                        With thee<br />                  O let me rise<br />            As larks, harmoniously,<br />      And sing this day thy victories:<br /> Then shall the fall further the flight in me.<br /> <br /> My tender age in sorrow did beginne<br />      And still with sicknesses and shame.<br />            Thou didst so punish sinne,<br />                  That I became<br />                        Most thinne.<br />                        With thee<br />                  Let me combine,<br />            And feel thy victorie:<br />         For, if I imp my wing on thine,<br /> Affliction shall advance the flight in me.</p> <h3>Book List:</h3> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3cwpbUm\">Beauty in the Word</a></em> by Stratford Caldecott</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3aqfohz\">Oedipus Rex</a></em> by Sophocles</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3aqq9As\">The White Company</a></em> by Arthur Conan Doyle</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2VkESbu\">Brigadier Gerard</a></em> by Arthur Conan Doyle</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3bqppww\">Sir Nigel</a></em> by Arthur Conan Doyle</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/34Leb33\">Howards End</a></em> by E.
