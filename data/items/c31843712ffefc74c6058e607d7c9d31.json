  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, Democrats have waged war on the middle-class, and voting is about transferring funds in the name of \"tax the rich.\" Open borders and the massive expansion of the welfare state through a transfer of funds from the middle-income earners to the lowest income earners using the power of government. Voting for Democrats is voting to have them give your money to someone else - their political base. This wealth transfer is not about liberty or our founding, it’s about advancing the agenda of leftwing politicians that have waged war on capitalism and liberty as we know it. The Democrat Party has fraudulently changed the way we vote by nationalizing it. Changing the electorate through illegal immigration to expand their base of support by importing illiterate newcomers so that they can get them hooked on the system that they've built and control. Later, assuming the major provisions of the Democrats bill remain consistent with their original budget proposal the actual cost of the bill would be closer to $5 trillion dollars. Nothing is temporary in government so it's likely if the bill is voted in it will be here to stay. Afterward, there's a big difference between supporting vaccines and supporting tyranny. The arguments over vaccinations continue as Biden announces that we won't be \"safe\" until 98% of the population is vaccinated. Despite the CDC's own data that shows that those that are vaccinated have a minimal risk of death in a breakthrough infection. With 76% of the population already vaccinated why is the federal government mandating vaccines when the data doesn't support it. Meanwhile, Biden hasn't added anything to the country's arsenal of therapeutics and other methods of combatting this virus. Finally, General Mark Milley is a failed General that will testify to defend his lack of leadership as he abandoned Americans to the Taliban in Afghanistan. Plus, the FBI's January 6th informant embedded in the Proud Boys has confirmed that the group had no plans to attack the Capitol that day.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
