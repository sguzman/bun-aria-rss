  "description": "$800 billion is a lot of money. That is the amount of cash the Obama administration pumped into the American economy through the 2009 American Recovery and Reinvestment Act. Ever wonder what happened to all that dough? In The New New Deal: The Hidden Story of Change in the Obama Era (Simon & Schuster, 2012), Michael Grunwald offers a readable yet painstaking account of the “Stimulus” bill’s significance.\n\nBased on interviews with White House insiders, readers get a front row seat for the deliberations and sausage making which led to this gargantuan bill. Countering conventional wisdom, Grunwald claims the Stimulus package successfully kept the economy out of depression and has established the groundwork for new industries. In effect, Obama has updated liberalism for a new era. Hope you enjoy my conversation with Michael Grunwald.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
