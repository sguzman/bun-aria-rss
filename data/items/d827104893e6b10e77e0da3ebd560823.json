Secrets of the Knights Templar? Bojangles’ missing leg? His missing eye? What is that island hiding? Anything at all? Will anything be found? Has anything been found? So many questions! Lives have been lost trying to solve that island’s mysteries. And I lost a lot of sleep trying to figure them out myself. So many crazy possibilities for what could be buried on Oak Island and we examine a lot of them and give a nice timeline of the digs in today’s so many shafts, so much Oak Island mystery edition of Timesuck!</p>\n<p>Trouble with the APP or new website?
