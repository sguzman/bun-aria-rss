What we are told is safe, is toxic; we are told we must do, we should not. How did this happen? Beginning with a tale of scientific discovery in the 1990s and early 2000s—involving telomeres and cancer and senescence and mice—we arrive at one answer: if the powers-that-be have insight, they are better served by keeping that insight to themselves, by refusing to share it. And so: all the newspapers, all the universities, all the everything, are failing. We also discuss baby formula—why you might want or need it, and share a recipe from a naturopath that will be far better than anything you can (or cannot) find on the shelves. And we discuss fathers: genetic fatherhood, biological fatherhood, cultural fatherhood. There are many ways to be a good father.</p><p> </p><p>*****</p><p> </p><p>Support the sponsors:</p><p> </p><p>Eight Sleep: Personalized thermoregulation while you sleep, and when you wake.
