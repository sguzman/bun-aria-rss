  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today, Zach comes at you with a short but powerful message. He often sees people searching for the next best marketing hack or sales tactic, and while you should always want to sharpen your saw, he recommends another way to really set yourself apart. It’s the one thing that separates the people who dominate from the people that just get by. It’s simply doing what you say you’re going to do. Which actually isn’t always simple. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Just 20 days before Zach’s live event, his featured speaker had to cancel. Zach had to issue some refunds and scramble to put together a new lineup. It would’ve been easier to just reschedule, but Zach said he was going to do something, so he was going to do it. Staying true to his word is one of Zach’s core values, so he’ll always do it, even when it’s difficult. He’s found that the long-term gain of staying true to your word outweighs any temporary setback. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">He’s also staying true to working on himself, recently adding EMDR therapy to his journey. He says it’s doing wonders with helping him to reprocess things and get rid of negative cognitions. He’s starting to finally feel good enough. He’s become a better husband, dad, friend, entrepreneur, and human being.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In an attempt to give back, Zach is currently working on redoing his whole newsletter. He wants to include resources, processes, tips and tricks, anything of value that he’s learned. It’s all free, to help you become the best version of yourself, whether personally or professionally. </span></p> <p><strong>What You’ll Learn:</strong></p> <ul> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">How to tap into nature's healing power.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">How to build a powerful network.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">Why core values are important.</span></li> <li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">And much more!</span></li> </ul> <p> </p> <p><strong>Favorite Quote:</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">“Best decision I ever made was to really go to work on myself.” -Zach Babcock</span></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>How to Get Involved:</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Get podcasting help</span> <a href=\"https://podcastpowertrain.com/\"><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">here</span></a><span style= \"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">For more on</span> <a href= \"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/ep-310-sneaky-good-marketing-strategies-with-rich-schefren/id1373572178?i=1000546792970\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">how to grow your business</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, check out this episode. </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">If you enjoyed this episode, head over and visit us on</span> <a href= \"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/underdog-empowerment/id1373572178\"> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Apple Podcasts</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">- leave a review and let us know what you thought!
