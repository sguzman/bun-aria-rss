  "description": "<p>We study the celebrated Shiryaev-Wonham filter in its historical setup of\nWonham (1964) where the hidden Markov jump process has two states. We are\ninterested in the weak noise regime for the observation equation.\nInterestingly, this becomes a strong noise regime for the filtering equations.\n</p>\n<p>Earlier results of the authors show the appearance of spikes in the filtered\nprocess, akin to a metastability phenomenon. This paper is aimed at\nunderstanding the smoothed optimal filter, which is relevant for any system\nwith feedback. In particular, we demonstrate that there is a sharp phase\ntransition between a spiking regime and a regime with perfect smoothing.\n</p>",
