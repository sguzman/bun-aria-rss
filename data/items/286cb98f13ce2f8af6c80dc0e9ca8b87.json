  "description": "<p>Mark Normand became the first (and only) guest in the newly built Skeptic Tank Studio! This was recorded March 17, the first day bars and restaurants were closed in New York. We talked about what it was doing to standup, our fears, made jokes about everything, and drank some ice cold Coronas while we did it. This podcast is also the first on the new Skeptic Tank youtube channel. (<a href=\"http://www.youtube.com/skeptictank\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">youtube.com/SkepticTank</a>) Check that out for full episodes, episode clips, brand new podcasts, and lots of new content. And subscribe! That's where all the live episodes will live from now on as opposed to the other YouTube channel that was just a still picture with the audio over it. </p> <p>Nobody knew how far Covid 19 would go and nobody was yet saying even not to meet up with friends. But in between recording this podcast, and before my interview the next day, it started to seem more like a health risk to have a guest and my producer come to the studio. So we called it off until we learned more. But before we did, Mark and I talked about all that was happening with the Swine AIDS.</p> <p>I spent half of February looking for a place and half of March building it. We'll be back. Probably. Who knows?</p> <p>Check out Mark's podcast, Tuesdays with Stories, that he does every Tuesday with Joe List. It's a great podcast and their back catalog should eat up tons of your free time. </p> <p>This episode was brought to you by Sheath Underwear. If you go to <a href=\"http://youtube.com/skeptictankpod\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">SheathUnderwear.com</a> and use the promo code \"Ari\" you save 20% off your order! That's a fifth!</p>",
