  "description": "This episode serves as a sort of “Dopamine Masterclass”. I discuss the immensely powerful chemical that we all make in our brain and body: dopamine. I describe what it does and the neural circuits involved. I explain dopamine peaks and baselines, and the cell biology of dopamine depletion. I include 14 tools for how to control your dopamine release for sake of motivation, focus, avoiding and combating addiction and depression, and I explain why dopamine stacking with chemicals and behaviors inevitably leads to states of underwhelm and poor performance. I explain how to achieve sustained increases in baseline dopamine, compounds that injure and protect dopamine neurons including caffeine from specific sources. I describe non-prescription supplements for increasing dopamine—both their benefits and risks—and synergy of pro-dopamine supplements with those that increase acetylcholine. \nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://insidetracker.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Introduction & Tool 1 to Induce Lasting Dopamine\n(00:04:48) Sponsors\n(00:09:10) Upcoming (Zero-Cost) Neuroplasticity Seminar for Educators\n(00:09:58) What Dopamine (Really) Does\n(00:15:30) Two Main Neural Circuits for Dopamine \n(00:18:14) How Dopamine Is Released: Locally and Broadly\n(00:22:03) Fast and Slow Effects of Dopamine\n(00:25:03) Dopamine Neurons Co-Release Glutamate\n(00:28:00) Your Dopamine History Really Matters \n(00:30:30) Parkinson’s & Drugs That Kill Dopamine Neurons.
