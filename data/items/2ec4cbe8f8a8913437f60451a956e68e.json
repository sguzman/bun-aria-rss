A demo of the hack debuted in an <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=EBCYvoC4muc&t=3s\">11-minute YouTube video</a> where Åkesson plays a Scott Joplin ragtime song and details the instrument's creation.</p>\n\n<p>Åkesson—a versatile musician himself—can actually play the Commodordion in real time like a real accordion. He plays a melody with his right hand on one C64 keyboard and controls the chord of a rhythm and bass line loop (that he can pre-record using the flip of a switch) using his left hand on the other keyboard.</p>\n<div class=\"video\"><div class=\"wrapper\" style=\"display:block\" type=\"text/html\" width=\"980\" height=\"550\" src=\"https://www.youtube.com/embed/EBCYvoC4muc?start=0&wmode=transparent\" frameborder=\"0\" allowfullscreen></div><p class=\"caption\" style=\"font-size:0.8em\">The Commodordion. </p></div>\n<p>A fair amount of custom software engineering and hardware hackery went into making the Commodordion possible, as Åkesson <a href=\"https://linusakesson.net/commodordion/index.php\">lays out</a> in a post on his website. It builds off of earlier projects (that he says were intentionally leading up to this one), such as the <a href=\"https://linusakesson.net/sixtyforgan/index.php\">Sixtyforgan</a> (a C64 with spring reverb and a chromatic accordion key layout) and <a href=\"https://linusakesson.net/software/qwertuoso/index.php\">Qwertuoso</a>, a program that allows live playing of the C64's famous <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/MOS_Technology_6581\">SID sound chip</a>.</p></div><p><a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1894944#p3\">Read 4 remaining paragraphs</a> | <a href=\"https://arstechnica.com/?p=1894944&comments=1\">Comments</a></p>"
