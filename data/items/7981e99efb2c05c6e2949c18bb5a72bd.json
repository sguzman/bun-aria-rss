  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, President Trump announced an Executive Order that would allow the citizenship question to remain on the 2020 census. Speaker Nancy Pelosi made comments to prevent ICE from doing their job offering legal advice to illegal aliens on what to do if they get caught during the ICE raids. Also, while some are out there screaming that we're losing the republic but they're not involved in any activism to counter the spread of leftist ideology. We are living in the world of the Democrat Party, the progressive movement has hijacked the media because the Democrats lost an election so now they're redefining what citizenship is so they can change the citizenry to hold on to power at any cost. Despite the fact that Trump has not even come close to deporting as many people as President Obama did, they attack him just the same. So now visa over-stayers and others in the country illegally that have been adjudicated for removal will be deported started Sunday. This prompted Pelosi, in true fascist fashion, to undermine the law and the executive branch and offer legal advice to illegal aliens to avoid being removed. Finally, second amendment expert and author John Lott calls in to discuss his Twitter account being locked after tweeting that the perpetrator of the New Zealand mosque shooting was “a socialist, environmentalist, who hates capitalists & free trade.” \nLearn more about your ad choices.
