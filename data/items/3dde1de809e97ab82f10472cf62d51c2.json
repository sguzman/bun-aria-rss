Was it a vision? \nOr did we see that day the unseeable \nOne glory of the everlasting world \nPerpetually at work, though never seen \nSince Eden locked the gate that’s everywhere \nAnd nowhere? Was the change in us alone, \nAnd the enormous earth still left forlorn, \nAn exile or a prisoner? Yet the world \nWe saw that day made this unreal, for all \nWas in its place. The painted animals \nAssembled there in gentle congregations, \nOr sought apart their leafy oratories, \nOr walked in peace, the wild and tame together, \nAs if, also for them, the day had come. \nThe shepherds’ hovels shone, for underneath \nThe soot we saw the stone clean at the heart \nAs on the starting-day. The refuse heaps \nWere grained with that fine dust that made the world; \nFor he had said, ‘To the pure all things are pure.’ \nAnd when we went into the town, he with us, \nThe lurkers under doorways, murderers, \nWith rags tied round their feet for silence, came \nOut of themselves to us and were with us, \nAnd those who hide within the labyrinth \nOf their own loneliness and greatness came, \nAnd those entangled in their own devices, \nThe silent and the garrulous liars, all \nStepped out of their dungeons and were free. \nReality or vision, this we have seen. \nIf it had lasted but another moment \nIt might have held for ever! But the world \nRolled back into its place, and we are here, \nAnd all that radiant kingdom lies forlorn, \nAs if it had never stirred; no human voice \nIs heard among its meadows, but it speaks \nTo itself alone, alone it flowers and shines \nAnd blossoms for itself while time runs on. \n\n\nBut he will come again, it’s said, though not \nUnwanted and unsummoned; for all things, \nBeasts of the field, and woods, and rocks, and seas, \nAnd all mankind from end to end of the earth \nWill call him with one voice. In our own time, \nSome say, or at a time when time is ripe. \nThen he will come, Christ the uncrucified, \nChrist the discrucified, his death undone, \nHis agony unmade, his cross dismantled— \nGlad to be so—and the tormented wood \nWill cure its hurt and grow into a tree \nIn a green springing corner of young Eden, \nAnd Judas damned take his long journey backward \nFrom darkness into light and be a child \nBeside his mother’s knee, and the betrayal \nBe quite undone and never more be done.",
