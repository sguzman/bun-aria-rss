  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, the individual mandate portion of the Obamacare law (Affordable Care Act) was removed by a vote in Congress at the behest of the President of The United States. Six justices are likely to uphold it for the sake of severability and with the individual mandate severed from the ACA, the law is likely to stand. The Democrats know this yet they turned today's hearing into a theatrical campaign commercial. Joe Biden is going to pack the Supreme Court and Congressional Democrats are subsequently intent on destroying it. Then, Anthony Fauci claims he's being taken out of context in the latest Trump campaign ad when he says that Trump's coordinated response was \"impressive\" and that the President has always \"followed the science.\" Fauci was unequivocal in his statement to Mark Levin on \"Life Liberty and Levin\" during the height of the pandemic. Later, RINO's and other radical leftists like AOC and renowned communist Angela Davis are excited about a Biden Presidency and have signed on to endorse Biden. Afterward, Sen. Lindsey Graham, chairman of the Senate Judiciary Committee joins the show to discuss today's hearing to confirm federal judge Amy Coney Barrett to the US Supreme Court. Graham also discussed using federal grants to get states to take control of their own healthcare. Graham stresses the importance of re-electing Trump in November. Finally, Congressional candidate Matt Rosendale calls in with an update on his campaign and why Democrats and Nancy Pelosi must be defeated.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
