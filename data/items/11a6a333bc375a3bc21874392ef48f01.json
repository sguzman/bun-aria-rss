  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, Democrats never give up, they will use anything including criminal law to crush their opponents. For example, it’s important for us to pushback against Ben and Jerry’s. The founders are being hailed as game-changers for the pro-Palestine BDS movement against Israel. We need to launch our own BDS movement against the left. Then, former Trump inaugural committee member, Tom Barrack, is arrested for alleged process crimes related to lobbying but it seems that his biggest crime was being a friend of Donald Trump's. While the media has already found him guilty, in reality, Barrack never got any official position in the Trump Administration to even commit the violations he's accused of. Later, Marxist thinking has been cloaked in environmentalism and income inequality aimed at destroying capitalism and the marriage of several of these areas like \"environmental racism.\" Rep. Alexandria Ocasio-Cortez is doubling down accusing Republicans of banning anti-racist training. Afterward, Sen. Rand Paul and Dr. Anthony traded barbs on the origins of the coronavirus, and point-blank asked him to retract his statement under penalty of perjuring himself before Congress. Fauci's semantics don't clear him from the truth revealed in the grant for the gain-of-function research.  Finally, Congressional Candidate Eli Crane (AZ-1) calls in to discuss the launch of his campaign.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
