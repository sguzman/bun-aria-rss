  "description": "<p>A successful actress and screenwriter for decades, <strong>Meridith Baer</strong> got into staging by chance. In the late 1990s, one of her friends needed help with a home that was languishing on the market. Baer helped decorate it, the house sold in a matter of days, and a business was born. Today her eponymous company dominates the industry, staging thousands of homes all over the country every year. On this episode of the podcast, Baer speaks with host <strong>Dennis Scully </strong>about what the housing market looks like from her perspective, whether midcentury modern style will ever go out of fashion, and why buzzy technology like augmented and virtual reality can only do so much when it comes to selling a home.</p><p>This episode is sponsored by <a href=\"www.junipermarket.com\"><strong>Juniper Market</strong></a></p><p><a href=\"www.meridithbaer.com\"><i><strong>LINKS</strong></i></a><br /><a href=\"www.meridithbaer.com\"><strong>Meridith Baer</strong></a><br /><a href=\"www.instagram.com/dennisscully\"><strong>Dennis Scully </strong></a><br /><a href=\"www.businessofhome.com\"><strong>Business of Home</strong></a></p>\n",
