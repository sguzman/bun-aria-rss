  "description": "The monkey king has done it all: he was immortal, he had allied with all the mythological creatures he could find, and he controlled an army 40,000 strong...but heaven didn't care about any of that. They were coming for him, whether or not it was legal, and there was nothing he could do to stop them. The creature this week is a big, angry, hairy unicorn with a...weird surprise. -- Sponsors: Check out season 2 of Wolverine: The Lost Trail at https://wolverinepodcast.com If there is something interfering with your happiness or preventing you from achieving your goals, BetterHelp online counseling can help.
