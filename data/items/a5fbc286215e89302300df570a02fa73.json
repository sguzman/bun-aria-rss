  "description": "“The police had surrounded the house. They had been there for quite a while. They didn’t want to try to rush the house because they thought he might kill one of the innocent people. But after waiting for a long time, I asked the police: ‘Let me see if I can talk to the guy.'”\nFor decades, TV news reporter Russ Ewing stood beside more than 100 people—at their request—as they surrendered to the police.\nWe speak with Charles Thomas, Marijane Placek, Pat Arnold, and Ken Bedford about Russ Ewing, and Chicago’s former police detective and commander, Jon Burge.\nThanks to CBC Licensing.\nSay hello on Twitter, Facebook and Instagram.
