  "description": "Market volatility is rampant. I break down the wild action so far this week… and why this market is unlike anything we’ve ever seen. [0:30] While I didn't expect this strong of a pullback this quickly, I’ve been warning about risks to the downside. I explain what inflation rates tell us about the possibility of a recession—and why that possibility isn’t as scary as it seems. [6:05] While it may be hard to see through the volatility, this is one of the best times to buy small caps in 10 years… and I expect one small-cap sector to see a major comeback in 2022. (It’s the sector I highlight in this month’s issue of , being released tomorrow.) [12:20]  I compare two growth stocks—Roblox (RBLX) and Rivian (RIVN)—that are selling off hard… and tell you which one I’d buy at current levels. [22:30] Turning to questions… Is now a good time to buy gold and silver stocks? In short, yes. I share why the environment for precious metals is fantastic… and how I would invest in the sector. [31:40] Could the Fed surprise the market and announce an interest rate hike during its meeting this week? I highlight what I expect from the Fed… [34:50] Enjoyed this episode?
