  "description": "<p>The time-evolution operator obtained from the fractional-time Schr\\\"{o}dinger\nequation (FTSE) is said to be non-unitary since it does not preserve the norm\nof the vector state in time. As done in the time-dependent non-Hermitian\nquantum formalism, for a traceless non-Hermitian two-level quantum system, we\ndemonstrate that it is possible to map the non-unitary time-evolution operator\nin a unitary one. It is done by considering a dynamical Hilbert space with a\ntime-dependent metric operator, constructed from a Hermitian time-dependent\nDyson map, in respect to which the system evolves in a unitary way, and the\nstandard quantum mechanics interpretation can be made properly. To elucidate\nour approach, we consider three examples of Hamiltonian operators and their\ncorresponding unitary dynamics obtained from the solutions of FTSE, and the\nrespective Dyson maps.\n</p>",
