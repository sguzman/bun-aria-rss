  "description": "Katie’s back with Travis & Christina to give advice to their younger selves. This ragtag group of people who still make this podcast catch up on how they handled the holiday season (9:50), and Trav shares a new pet peeve (21:50). Hear every NFL score from a disembodied voice, and get answers to all the big questions: Should the Dolphins draft a QB (32:22)? Do the Bengals know how to tweet (35:42)? What do the Falcons think “reportedly” means (48:42)? Why is Katie so fired up about what the Eagles insist they didn’t do (1:05:50)? PLUS, a quick bachelorette update (1:21:00), a brief dissertation on reality reunion shows (1:25:50), and no less than 5 minutes devoted to food delivery apps (1:35:30). Top it all off with a little “what language do dogs think in (1:48:10)?” and folks? That’s a podcast.",
