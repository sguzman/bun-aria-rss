  "description": "<p>Today’s guests are two boundary breaking women in the food world—butchers Erika Nakamura and Jocelyn Guest. They are the co-owners of White Gold Butchers, a new hot spot on the Upper West Side of New York that’s both a butcher shop and a cozy neighborhood restaurant. Erika, who was born and raised in Tokyo, got into butchery after working in some of New York’s top kitchens. Jocelyn, meanwhile, is an Army brat who moved every summer until she was 13. Prior to finding her calling, Jocelyn was a comedy writer. We’ll talk about their careers, what it’s like to work with their co-owners Chef April Bloomfield and rock-n-roll restaurateur Ken Friedman, and how they find mindful farm partners. But sure to check out the farm section of their website to see how seriously they take sourcing.</p>\n",
