  "description": "<p>Murdered in a uniquely gruesome and prolonged series of events; Reggie and Carol Sumner are the helpless victims of a month-long plan carried out with the help of a familiar face. Buried alive in a pre-dug hole near the Florida/Georgia line, these two high-school sweethearts suffer their terrible end at the hands of Tiffany Cole, her boyfriend Michael James Jackson, Alan Wade, and Bruce Kent Nixon, Jr.</p>\n<p>Tiffany Cole buys a vehicle from the Sumner family and travels to Jacksonville regularly to pay down her debt. That is, until her new boyfriend,  Michael James Jackson,  hatches a plan that ends in the Sumners' deaths.</p>\n<p>After being buried alive, under hundreds of pounds of dirt, an autopsy determines that the couple's cause of death is mechanical asphyxiation (i.e. physical interference with breathing and or circulation).    In this episode of Body Bags, forensics expert Joseph Scott Morgan and Jackie Howard take a closer look at these horrifying deaths.  </p>\n<p>Subscribe to Body Bags with Joseph Scott Morgan :</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/body-bags-with-joseph-scott-morgan/id1587763116\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\" data-linkindex=\"0\"><strong>Apple Podcasts</strong></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/385AEt9XDYJoCyWtGZo3bw?si=j4zNy8vhQISmIFTA0HvASg&dl_branch=1\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\" data-linkindex=\"1\"><strong>Spotify</strong></a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.iheart.com/podcast/269-body-bags-with-joseph-scot-87375583/\" data-auth=\"NotApplicable\" data-linkindex=\"2\"><strong>iHeart</strong></a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
