She was a fitness instructor, married and the mother of three daughters. She was found murdered on Monday, April 18th, 2016 inside the Creek Side Church in Midlothian, Texas. She was scheduled to teach a class there early that morning. Later that day, The Midlothian Police Department released surveillance video from the Church that showed Missy’s killer, dressed in police tactical gear. This person was walking through the halls of the Church, opening doors and breaking glass, prior to Missy’s arrival. Initial reports suggested that Missy may have interrupted a burglary in progress at the Church and had been killed as a result. Today we discuss this truly fascinating case.            <a href=\"http://www.barkbox.com/TCG\"></a></p>\n<p> </p><p><a href=\"https://truecrimegarage.com/home\">Beer Fund: https://truecrimegarage.com/home</a></p>\n",
