  "description": "As Richard Nixon might have said, \"What are we going to do when we don't have Western Civilization to kick around any more?\"  Things happen fast in this bad old world and a few years is a enough time for the wheels to come flying off the damn cart.  And if you don't get our point, that may have been a wheel that went flying by on Monday in Helsinki.  Our panel of IISS' Kori Schake, Georgetown Law School's Rosa Brooks, the Financial Times' Ed Luce and New Jersey's own David Rothkopf, contemplate where we go from here and why recent experiences with bedtime stories are not altogether comforting.
