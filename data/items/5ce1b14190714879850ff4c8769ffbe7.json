This thing was looking in my deer blind....I was shocked... I drew what I seen and put a quick me side beside it for comparison\"</p> <p> </p> <p>Check out the episode page on our website to see Winston's drawing here: <a href= \"https://sasquatchchronicles.com/sc-ep620-this-thing-was-looking-in-my-deer-blind/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">https://sasquatchchronicles.com/sc-ep620-this-thing-was-looking-in-my-deer-blind/</a></p> <p> </p> <p>I will also be welcoming Pat to the show who is a military veteran from Canada.
