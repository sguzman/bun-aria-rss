  "description": "<p>EPISODE 99 - FRANCES MCDORMAND - Actress, Producer</p> <p>Team Deakins gets the chance to catch up with a long-time friend, actress, and producer Frances McDormand (NOMADLAND, THREE BILLBOARDS OUTSIDE EBBING MISSOURI, FARGO). It’s a great conversation that hits lots of topics! Fran shares with us the difference for her between acting in theater and in film, what her approach is to acting, and how she learned and added to her craft over the years. She has lots of stories of her experience on the film Blood Simple which was an early experience with a lot of learning and where she met Joel Coen, her long-time partner. We also talk about working with less structure, improv, and playing a femme fatale. Fran shares her experiences on Nomadland, Olive Kitteridge, Mississippi Burning, and The Man Who Wasn’t there. We touch on how she chooses her roles and how she likes to mix things up with “palette cleansers”, playing a supporting role as well as how she feels she is a partner with the camera operator. And more and more! A great discussion with the always interesting and fun Fran! Don’t miss it!</p>",
