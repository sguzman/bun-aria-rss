  "description": "This week we focus on leadership and comfort in a time of national tragedy, crisis and mourning.\nOn September 14th 2001 - President George W. Bush spoke at the National Cathedral in Washington at a National Day of Prayer and Remembrance Service.\nJust 72 hours earlier - more than 3,000 Americans had been killed during the most lethal terrorist attack in US history. \nThe country was still shut down - commercial air travel was grounded. The dead were still being counted. But the president talked of unity. The tragedy whose full toll had yet to be reckoned, could have torn the country apart, but instead it had united the American people and their leadership.\nHe expressed both empathy for those who lost family, friends and loved ones and a steady resolve that they shall not have died in vain.\nIn the interest of full disclosure - I joined President Bush’s White House staff less than three months after this speech. I was a Democrat from New York who had worked at both ABC and NBC News. Not the most likely candidate to serve in the West Wing under a Republican President from Texas. \nIn the weeks, months and years that followed this speech - the President, his advisors and his Administration myself included - make some serious and consequential mistakes. \nWe will spend the rest of our lives trying to rectify those errors and atone for those failings. \nBut in the immediate aftermath of that national tragedy- President Bush provided leadership and resolve as well as a few things that the American people desperately needed - comfort, empathy and hope. \n\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/words-matter.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
