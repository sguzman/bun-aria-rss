After adventuring through a perilous blizzard and conquering Long Lake during a deep freeze, we performed heroically at Lakeview Restaurant. Kirk got the key to the town of Madawaska, we had a live marriage proposal, and there was even a little bit of Springsteen in the house.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
