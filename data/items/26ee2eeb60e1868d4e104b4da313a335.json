  "description": "<p style=\"font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">Last week, Ben posted <a href=\"http://www.lawfareblog.com/five-hard-encryption-questions\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">five hard questions </a>to both government and industry regarding encryption and the \"going dark\" debate. We posed these questions and more on the issues of technology, public policy and corporate responsibility to Mike Janke, co-founder and Chairman of <a href=\"http://www.silentcircle.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"nofollow\">Silent Circle</a>, an international company that sells a platform of devices and services with built-in privacy-by-design. As a former Navy SEAL, Mr. Janke, who previously was CEO and founder of a private security company, offers a unique perspective with respect to the equities of law enforcement and other government officials who have a mandate to keep people safe, individuals' right to privacy, and corporate duties to protect intellectual property and customer data.</p><p style=\"font-family: sans-serif; font-size: 14px;\">One thing that listeners will likely take away from the interview is that law enforcement has a long way to go before convincing sophisticated industry participants that the FBI or other government entities are not actually technically capable of accessing the communications or devices they need in a pinch. Janke also makes a compelling case for why companies should be wary of the cybersecurity risks posed by communications or storage services or products that are capable of being decrypted. And yet, we identify what just might be a fault line between tech leaders' claims that end-to-end encryption is necessary to address the privacy concerns of everyday users, and the reality of who is the real market for a secure platform, at least in Silent Circle's recent experience. And we leave open the door as to whether there is room in the debate to carve out some middle ground when innocent victims are in harms way.</p><p>Support this show <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"http://supporter.acast.com/lawfare\">http://supporter.acast.com/lawfare</a>.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
