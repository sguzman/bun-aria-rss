  "description": "<p>On today's show, the boys chat about their weekends that were filled with landscaping moves, as Tony bought a new Z-Turn mower for his yard, Zito has been hiring the local football team to mow his, and Ty ran over a croquet ball with his lawn mower and is now looking for a new one. They also discuss some of the new movies and shows they've been watching before jumping into a loaded Pod FOD with topics including a pick 3 of some of the greatest action stars of all-time, a massive python that ate a woman whole in Indonesia, Anthony Mackie officially becoming a leading man by becoming the new Captain America, the new Game of Thrones series in development at HBO, and finally, the boys get into a comprehensive debate about the new Mortal Kombat movie and whether or not it was good or just entertaining, plus much more.

We appreciate you all for listening, we'll see you on Friday.</p>\n",
