  "description": "<p>Given two sets A={a_1,a_2,...,a_s} and {b_1,b_2,...,b_t}, a many-to-many\nmatching with demands and capacities (MMDC) between A and B matches each\nelement a_i in A to at least \\alpha_i and at most \\alpha'_i elements in B, and\neach element b_j in B to at least \\beta_j and at most \\beta'_j elements in A\nfor all 1=&lt;i&lt;=s and 1=&lt;j&lt;=t. In this paper, we present an algorithm for finding\na minimum-cost MMDC between A and B using the well-known Hungarian algorithm.\n</p>",
