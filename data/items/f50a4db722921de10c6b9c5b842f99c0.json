  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, The media is smearing Ivanka Trump attempting to connect her private email use to Hillary Clinton’s use and illegal scrubbing of an email server on which she discussed classified information. You really do have to have a negative IQ to draw that conclusion. Ivanka has not installed an illegal unsecure server in her home like Hillary did and Ivanka didn't delete tens of thousands of emails. What Ivanka did does not compare to what Hillary did. Then, Barack Obama stacked the courts with radicals and left our country worse off than he found it and was proud to focus on \"fundamental transformation\". He created distrust in many communities and trashed our law enforcement. yet, he gets a pass, his wife gets a pass, and his kids get a pass. Obama was a grave damage to our country, but President Trump gets attacked daily, they go after his wife, and want to see his kids in jail. Obama saved the Iranian regime that kills journalists, women, and gays; paying them off in hard currency. But Trump is lambasted for his alliance with the Saudi's to mutually take on Iran. Yet Iran who chants \"Death to America\" has been building nukes for years. Saudi Arabia doesn't have any nukes, but Trump is criticized for reaffirming a commitment to them as an ally while Obama was applauded for paying off the genocidal maniacs in Iran. Also, a federal Judge in San Francisco decided Trump’s decision to require those seeking asylum to go to a legal port of entry, as opposed to rushing the Mexican border is Trump changing the law. It used to be understood that this is an area where the president has plenary power.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
