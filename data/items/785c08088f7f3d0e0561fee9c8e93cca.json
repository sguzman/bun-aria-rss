  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, WMAL Radio Host Larry O’Connor fills in for Mark. The legacy corporate media is the reason why talk radio exists, and the silencing of the Hunter Biden laptop story is a perfect example. Now two years after the election the New York Times says that we're allowed to know the truth because the Hunter Biden laptop story would have ruined Joe Biden's election. It was only after Joe Biden became the Democrat nominee that he needed to be protected by the media and fact checkers. The first amendment does not exist for reporters, publishers, or website owners; it exists for we the people. The Hunter Biden media conspiracy news cycle is the latest in the war against truth, and why talk radio needs to exist so we can speak the truth. If you repeated this story a year and a half ago, you would be called a propaganda puppet of Russia for pushing disinformation. This is how they bullied people into silence and accepting their narrative. As Putin fires missiles from the sky upon innocent Ukrainian civilians and inflicting bloody mayhem, the Russian woman that paid off Hunter Biden with $3.5 million isn't sanctioned by the Biden Administration. Also, President Zelenskyy made a passionate plea before Congress to help push back against barbaric Russian aggression. We need to give Ukraine all the weapons and jet fighters they need to fight.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
