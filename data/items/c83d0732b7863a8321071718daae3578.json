That may sound strange, but we’ve had a dream to host large events and teach real life homesteading classes for a long time now, and this property, just ½ mile from our current home became available and we bought it! You’ll have to listen to the podcast (and watch the tour) to hear more of our vision for the property, but I’m so excited to finally be able to share this news with you!
