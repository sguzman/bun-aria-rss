  "description": "<p>Monday 11/30 - Today on the show we had Trey Songz stop by where he spoke about his new movie \"Blood Brother\", new music, and how he believes that our show sells negativity. But do we really sell negativity or do people like the negativity more than all the positive things we do? so we opened up the phone lines to see if our listeners could list all the positive things we do. Also, since Charlamagne was not here we gave the listeners a chance to give someone \"Donkey of the Day\" and we also opened the phone lines to see what is the craziest thing someone asked them to do during sex for Freaky Friday. </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
