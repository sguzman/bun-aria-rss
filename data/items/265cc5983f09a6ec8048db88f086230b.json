  "description": "<p>This episode is a difficult&nbsp;listen but an important one. We at Real Crime Profile feel so devastated,&nbsp;frustrated and angry about the recent events in Texas and we know many of you feel the same.</p><p>In this episode we speak from our professional experience as well as from the heart, Lisa and Laura as mother's and Jim as an uncle. Things get emotional and a little heated. We feel strongly about&nbsp;preventing the next shooter and protecting the public. These murders are preventable. We all need to take action. Join us for&nbsp;Part 2 of our discussion.</p><p>Again, we extend our deepest sympathy and sorrow for the 21 victims who lost their lives on May 24th, 2022 at the Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, Texas. We are holding their families and community in our hearts along with the other victims who were injured and survived.&nbsp;</p><p>#MaleViolence #MaleEntitlement #ChildrenMatter #WomenMatter #EnoughIsEnough #MassShooting</p><p>Their names were:</p><p>#EvaMireles</p><p>#XavierLopez</p><p>#JoseFlores</p><p>#IrmaGarcia</p><p>#NevaehBravo</p><p>#EllieGarcia</p><p>#TessMata</p><p>#AlexandriaRubio</p><p>#JacklynCazares</p><p>#JailahSilguero</p><p>#JayceLuevanos</p><p>#MirandaMathis</p><p>#AmerieJoGarza</p><p>#MakennaLeeElrod</p><p>#LaylaSalazar</p><p>#MaiteRodriguez</p><p>#AnnabellRodriguez</p><p>#EliahanaCruzTorres</p><p>#RojelioTorres</p><p>#AlithiaRamirez</p><p>#UziyahGarcia</p><p>You must listen to the incredible, comprehensive book \"How to Stop A Mass Shooting Epidemic\" by Professors Jillian Peterson and James Hensley.
