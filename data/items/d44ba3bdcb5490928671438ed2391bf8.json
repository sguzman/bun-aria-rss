  "description": "<p>This paper analyzes dysarthric speech datasets from three languages with\ndifferent prosodic systems: English, Korean, and Tamil. We inspect 39 acoustic\nmeasurements which reflect three speech dimensions including voice quality,\npronunciation, and prosody. As multilingual analysis, examination on the mean\nvalues of acoustic measurements by intelligibility levels is conducted.\nFurther, automatic intelligibility classification is performed to scrutinize\nthe optimal feature set by languages. Analyses suggest pronunciation features,\nsuch as Percentage of Correct Consonants, Percentage of Correct Vowels, and\nPercentage of Correct Phonemes to be language-independent measurements. Voice\nquality and prosody features, however, generally present different aspects by\nlanguages. Experimental results additionally show that different speech\ndimension play a greater role for different languages: prosody for English,\npronunciation for Korean, both prosody and pronunciation for Tamil. This paper\ncontributes to speech pathology in that it differentiates between\nlanguage-independent and language-dependent measurements in intelligibility\nclassification for English, Korean, and Tamil dysarthric speech.\n</p>",
