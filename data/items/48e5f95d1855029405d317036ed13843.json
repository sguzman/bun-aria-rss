  "description": "<p>This week David and Marina are joined by Scott Mitchell, Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Scott Mitchell Studio, to discuss his designs, his early interests in architecture, his office, influential people in his life, the power of thoughtful architecture, and much more. Enjoy!</p> <p>Scott Mitchell is the Founder and Chief Executive Officer of Scott Mitchell Studio. Over more than 20 years he has developed an extensive design portfolio across the U.S. and internationally. Scott is renowned for his warm approach to connecting the built and natural environment and his humanistic approach to architecture. His nomadic upbringing took him from Jordan to Japan to the American Southwest—where he bore early witness to the stone ruins of Petra and Wadi Rum, the Shinto houses of Okinawa and the Sonoran Desert. Scott’s design philosophy is influenced equally by his early encounters with antiquity, as by his relationships with modernist architects Richard Meier and Charles Gwathmey, and by the work of Louis I. Kahn and Rudolph M. Schindler. </p> <div> </div> <div>Scott received a Bachelor of Environmental Design from Texas A&M University before moving to New York to work at Stephen Miller Siegel & Associates and then to Bridgehampton to work with Preston T. Phillips, a former protégé of architect Paul Rudolph. He was offered an internship in Norman Foster’s London office and then moved back to the U.S. to pursue graduate studies at the Southern California Institute of Architecture (SCI-Arc), before establishing Scott Mitchell Studio in 1999. Scott is author of the monograph Scott Mitchell Houses (Rizzoli), which includes eight of the studio’s pivotal projects and includes contributions by Paul Goldberger, Calvin Klein and Michael Webb.</div> <p>This episode is supporte<span style=\"color: #000000;\">d by <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href= \"https://www.brizo.com/?utm_source=SS&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=brizo2021\">Brizo</a> • <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href= \"https://monograph.io/?ref=secondstudio\">Monograph</a> • <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href= \"http://www.mieleusa.com/\">Miele</a></span><span style= \"color: #000000;\"> • <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href= \"https://graphisoft.com/solutions/archicad\">Graphisoft</a></span></p> <p><strong>SUBSCRIBE</strong><br /> <span style=\"color: #000000;\"> • <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href= \"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/the-second-studio-design-and-architecture-show/id1223815551\"> Apple Podcasts</a></span><br /> <span style=\"color: #000000;\"> • <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href= \"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCUWyNdjf3Gu6_3gpwq9Yu2Q\">YouTube</a></span><br />  <span style=\"color: #000000;\"> • <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href= \"https://open.spotify.com/show/3TVq5fuaZPSzlD84bk3Oqj\">Spotify</a></span></p> <p><strong>CONNECT</strong><br /> <span style=\"color: #000000;\"> •</span> <span style= \"color: #000000;\"><a style=\"color: #000000;\" href= \"https://www.secondstudiopod.com/\">Website: www.secondstudiopod.com</a><br /></span><span style= \"color: #000000;\"> • <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href= \"https://www.instagram.com/secondstudiopod/\">Instagram</a><br /></span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> • <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href= \"https://www.facebook.com/secondstudiopod/\">Facebook</a><br /></span><span style=\"color: #000000;\"> • <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href= \"https://twitter.com/SecondStudioPod\">Twitter</a><br />  • Call or text questions to 213-222-6950</span></p> <p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>SUPPORT</strong><br /> Leave a review :)</span></p> <p><span style=\"color: #000000;\"><strong>EPISODE CATEGORIES</strong><br /> <strong> •  <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href= \"https://www.secondstudiopod.com/interviews\">Interviews</a>:</strong> Interviews with industry leaders.<br /></span> <span style= \"color: #000000;\"><strong> •  <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href=\"https://www.secondstudiopod.com/interviews\">Design Companion</a>:</strong> Informative talks for clients. <br /> <strong> •  <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href= \"https://www.secondstudiopod.com/after-hours\">After Hours</a> (AH)</strong>: Casual conversations about everyday life.<br /> <strong> •  <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href= \"https://www.secondstudiopod.com/design-review\">Design Reviews</a></strong>: Reviews of creative projects and buildings.<br /> <strong> •  <a style=\"color: #000000;\" href= \"https://www.secondstudiopod.com/fellow-designer\">Fellow Designer</a></strong>: Tips for designers.</span></p>",
