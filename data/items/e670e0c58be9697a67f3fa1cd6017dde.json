Mitochondria are the microscopic powerhouses hiding within most cells and they have huge consequences for our health. Damaged mitochondria can lead to a host of insults, including metabolic disease. Healthy mitochondria, on the other hand, can result in optimal aging.</p><br><p>Dr. Hyman discussed the topic of mitochondria, and how we can best support them in recent conversations with Dave Asprey and Dr. Todd LePine.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Dave Asprey is the founder and CEO of Bulletproof 360, creator of the global phenomenon Bulletproof Coffee, a two-time New York Times bestselling author, the host of the Webby award-winning podcast Bulletproof Radio, serial entrepreneur, and global change agent. By employing the principles of biohacking (a term added to the Merriam-Webster Dictionary in September of 2018 with Dave’s influence) Dave has lost over 100 pounds, upgraded his brain, learned to sleep more efficiently in less time, and become a more effective entrepreneur, husband, father, and overall human being. In this episode, he shares his top tips and tricks for being superhuman and living to be 180 or beyond.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Dr. Todd LePine graduated from Dartmouth Medical School and is Board Certified in Internal Medicine, specializing in Integrative Functional Medicine. He is an Institute for Functional Medicine Certified Practitioner. Prior to joining my team at The UltraWellness Center, he worked as a physician at Canyon Ranch in Lenox, MA, for 10 years. Dr. LePine’s goal is to help patients achieve vitality through focusing on optimal aging, bio-detoxification, functional gastrointestinal health, systemic inflammation, autoimmune disorders, and the neurobiology of mood and cognitive disorders.</p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by Perfect Keto.
