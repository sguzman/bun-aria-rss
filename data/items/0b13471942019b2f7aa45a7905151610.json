  "description": "“The law firm dropped the ball here…”\nPreviously on the Murdaugh Murders Podcast, we told you about how Alex Murdaugh is accused of stealing more than ​​$6.2 million in alleged schemes related to his fake FORGE accounts at Bank of America dating back to 2016.\nHe’s accused of stealing millions of dollars from clients while he was a partner at the law firm started by his great grandfather - PMPED. \nBut so far, PMPED has escaped accountability. \nWhile PMPED partners have been claiming to “make Alex’s victims whole,” it appears like something else was happening behind the scenes. \nOn this episode, we speak with South Carolina attorney and lawmaker Justin Bamberg — who has stepped in the arena as a voice for victims. \nBamberg says a lawsuit, and possibly a class action, is likely coming against PMPED. He asks any of Murdaugh’s former clients believing they were taken advantage of to call his law firm at 803-956-5088 or email him at pmpedmypockets@bamberglegal.com.\n\nAs you know, we are a mission-driven podcast - we expose the truth wherever it leads. \n\nWhile accomplishing this mission we always take care to respect victims and we are sensitive to the traumatic nature of this story.  We are also very sensitive to our fans - many of which have requested MMP merchandise. We believe we have found a great way to accomplish both of these goals:\n\nWe are excited to announce that pre-sales for Murdaugh Murders Podcast merch is now live at MurdaughMurdersPodcast.com.MERCH\n\nAll net proceeds from merchandise sales are donated to victim-focused charities like Hopeful Horizons and others on a regular rotation. Hopeful Horizons is a children's advocacy, domestic violence and rape crisis center. \n\nAnd please consider donating to the Standing For Stephen Go Fund Me.\n\nThe Murdaugh Murders Podcast is created by Mandy Matney and produced by Luna Shark Productions.
