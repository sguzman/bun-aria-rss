    "media:description": "ben 10 has made some awesome games over the years, and we're speedrunning them today\n\nMy 2nd channel (WEEKLY UPLOADS): https://www.youtube.com/eaziestspeezy\nWatch live at: https://twitch.tv/EazySpeezy\n\n▶ Twitter: https://twitter.com/EazySpeezy\n▶ Instagram: https://instagram.com/EazySpeezy/\n▶ Merch: https://eazyspeezy.com\n\nMy channel generally focuses on a more casual side of speedruns. With these videos I want to show off cool speedruns, explain how they work, and entertain. Hopefully you enjoy the content and maybe even take up speedrunning yourself, because it is truly a lot of fun!\n\nToday we're speedrunning every Ben 10 flash game. Well, at least the ones that actually have speedruns. This was definitely nostalgic and a great time overall, but did I get a world record in any of them?\n\n#EazySpeezy #Ben10 #Speedrun",
