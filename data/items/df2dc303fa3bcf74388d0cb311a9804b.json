Since the 1940’s, dreamers have imagined a new underground rail line linking the Paddington and Liverpool Street stations in London, connecting the east and west. Then, in 2008, under the name Crossrail, the project was approved. Between 2009 and 2022, the enormous project was constructed. Over 40 kilometers of underground tunnels were bored, 10 new stations were excavated and constructed, and 50 kilometers of new tracks were laid. Then, on May 24th, 2022, the new line opened. Named the Elizabeth Line, it has increased London’s rail capacity by 10% and is expected to add £42 BN to the UK economy. It is a new favorite of London residents and will help commuters move across the city for the next 120 years.\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, please consider subscribing to Futurology for more similar content!\n\nThank you to the following sources!\n\nInformation\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Crossrail\nhttps://www.theguardian.com/environment/2022/may/21/how-londons-new-rail-project-has-created-a-sanctuary-for-birds\nhttps://www.crossrail.co.uk/project/tunnelling/railway-tunnels\nhttps://www.therailwayhub.co.uk/10580/from-the-archive-railway-personalities-george-dow/\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/History_of_the_Crossrail_project\nhttps://www.railway-technology.com/analysis/timeline-crossrail-delays/\nhttps://www.railwaysarchive.co.uk/documents/DoT_CentralLondonRailStudy1989.pdf\n\nAudio\nStoryblocks\nYouTube Audio Library\n\nGraphics\nGoogle Earth\nStoryblocks\nCrossrail\n\nVideo Chapters\n00:00 - Intro\n02:07 - Project Details\n04:22 - Construction\n09:53 - Elizabeth Line",
