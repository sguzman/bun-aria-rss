The hard part of this episode was convincing these two guys that they were way more attractive than average men. Most of our discussion was spent talking about the women we've managed to finagle into our beds. They had a much easier time finagling than I did. It's not like I think I'm ugly, definitely not by semitic standards, but these guys are in a different category.  Enjoy</span></p>",
