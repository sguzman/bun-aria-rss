  "description": "<p>Some of the most important financial decisions we make are done infrequently. So because of that we feel a little rusty every time we perform that task. Buying a car is one of those infrequent decisions that can oftentimes blindside us if we’re not prepared. On one hand this can be an exciting time, but on the other it can be really nerve-wracking since the average person buys a car every six years. That’s plenty of time to forget how to do it by the next time you need to buy a car. And that problem is compounded by the fact that we’ve seen a huge shift over the past 18 months in pricing and purchasing dynamics. Supply chain issues have led to much higher prices! Since so much is at stake, it’s crucial that you take the proper steps to make sure you’re going about buying a car the right way.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Pothole City Rocky Road Stout by Pipeworks Brewing!
