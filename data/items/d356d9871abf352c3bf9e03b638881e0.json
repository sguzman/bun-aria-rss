    "media:description": "This video shows a compliant mechanism that Prof. Hopkins designed as a visualization challenge. Given its complex arrangement of bent-blade flexures, most students can’t visualize how the mechanism can deform. See if you can and then write your answer in the comment’s section below before I show the answer so everyone can gauge how difficult this challenge is for everyone else. Good luck!\n\nThe part files for the mechanism can be downloaded from Thingiverse at this link:\n\nhttps://www.thingiverse.com/thefactsofmechanicaldesign/designs\n\nAcknowledgements:\nSpecial thanks to Ivan Biggs, who helped to fabricate and assemble the design.\n\nDisclaimer: \nResponsibility for the content of this video is my own.
