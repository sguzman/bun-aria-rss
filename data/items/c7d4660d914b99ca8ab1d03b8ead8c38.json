  "description": "<p>This week I’m pleased to welcome back <em>The Intercept’s</em> Andrew Fishman for an update on <em>Foreign Exchanges’</em> favorite world leader, Brazilian President Jair Bolsonaro. We’ll talk about Bolsonaro’s cratering poll numbers, fueled by a bungling response to COVID and anger over <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2021/07/31/bolsonaro-brazil-covid-vaccine-corruption/\">rampant corruption</a>.</p><p>We’ll talk about Lula’s legal vindication and his reemergence as the favorite to become Brazil’s next president. We’ll talk about the <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://theintercept.com/2021/08/11/bolsonaro-brazil-congress-elections-2022/\">alterations</a> Bolsonaro and his oligarch buddies are attempting to make to the Brazilian electoral system and about the likelihood of a coup should, as expected, Lula win next year’s presidential election. And we’ll talk about what may be Bolsonaro’s greatest contribution to mankind, the possibly irreversible destruction of the Amazon rain forest. Possibly one of the more depressing episodes this podcast has ever produced, and that’s saying something.</p> <br/><br/>This is a public episode.
