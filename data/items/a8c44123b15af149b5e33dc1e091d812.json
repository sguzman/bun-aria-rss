  "description": "It’s a question as old as time itself: does the soul continue on after death? We may never have a definite answer, but there are certainly stories out there that make it hard to believe that death is truly the end. \nFirst, Sapphire shares an urban legend about an Indonesian girl’s encounter with a shrouded corpse.  Then, we’ll try to solve the mystery of a young girl’s outbursts. After that, we’ll visit a school in the Philippines where a dead girl might still roam. And finally, we'll pay visit to an Irish church where a lonely bride remains.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
