  "title": "You've outraged the internet? Here's how to apologize. (Bryan Goldberg, CEO, Bustle)",
  "description": "Bustle CEO Bryan Goldberg talks with Recode's Peter Kafka about launching a site aimed at millennial women — and why having a man at the top made a lot of people wary. Goldberg bragged a bit too aggressively and had to spend several months explaining his words, but says \"apologizing is great.\" He also talks about how Bustle rose to 40 million monthly pageviews, why it doesn't care as much about Facebook video views and why he'd rather hire young women out of journalism school than media stars who will bring attention to themselves.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
