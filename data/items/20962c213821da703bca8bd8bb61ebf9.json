    "media:description": "Why do we care about vectors?  Vectors are an incredibly important concept both in geometric algebra and in modern mathematics in general.  In this video, I show the motivation for the interpretation of vectors as arrows.  After that, I describe the basics of this conception of vectors.\n\nThis video is a part of \"From Zero to Geo\", a series where we formulate geometric algebra, an incredibly powerful branch of mathematics, from the ground up.
