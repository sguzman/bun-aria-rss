Today we're speedrunning Just Cause 3 to 100%. I was given lots of dogs coin by Elon musk to play this game instead of BATTLEFIELD 2042 (This is definitely 100% true).  I am speedrunning this game like my FAVOURITE Minecraft speedrunner DREAM!! (WOOOOOO!!!!) Who did not fight Floyd Mayweather or Logan Paul in FORTNITE or THE STATE OF ORIGIN  (YEAH!!). I do not own any Apple products, but if I did, I would be very interested in WWDC21 and IOS 15 (VERY RELEVANT TO ME!)",
