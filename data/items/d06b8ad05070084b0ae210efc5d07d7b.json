  "description": "The former president publicly went after Cassidy Hutchinson after her testimony in front of the Jan. 6th Committee, and he may have attempted to intimidate her behind the scenes as well. Over at the Supreme Court, their recent rulings regarding religion further erode the idea that America’s government should operate independently of any church. And Rep. Kinzinger tells Stephen that the Jan. 6th Committee was aware of threats against Cassidy Hutchinson’s safety and that’s why her testimony was given at a hastily-announced surprise hearing on June 28th. He also addresses his frustration with the DOJ’s handling of people who refuse to testify before the Jan. 6th Committee, and lays out the bottom-line purpose of the committee: to make the coup plotters pay for their crimes.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
