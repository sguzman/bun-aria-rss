  "description": "<p>The Zalud House in Porterville, California is like a time capsule glimpse into the life of a family. A family who suffered much tragedy in the house. This home is unique in that the Zalud Family were the only family to live in this mansion and it is furnished with their belongings. Several family members died here and it seems to have trapped their spirits. Paranormal tours are offered and Ghost Adventures has investigated the house. Some of the activity is fairly mundane, but there also is a darkness here that seems to be connected to a chair. Join us as we share the history and haunts of the Zalud House! Moment in Oddity was suggested by John Michaels and features Alice Blunden buried alive twice and This Month in History features Will Rogers. Our location was suggested by Anna Frias.</p> <p>Check out the website: http://historygoesbump.com<br /> <br /> Show notes can be found here: https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2020/10/hgb-ep-359-zalud-house.html</p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</p> <p>The following music is from https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/:</p> <p>\"Vanishing\" by Kevin MacLeod (Moment in Oddity)<br /> \"In Your Arms\" by Kevin MacLeod (This Month in History)</p> <p>License: CC BY (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)</p> <p>All other music licensing: PODCASTMUSIC.COM License Synchronization, Mechanical, Master Use and Performance Direct License for a Single Podcast Series under current monthly subscription.</p> <p>Zombie Cemetery by 5 Alarm Music</p>",
