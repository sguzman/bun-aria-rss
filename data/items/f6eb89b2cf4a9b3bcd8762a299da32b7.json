  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys chat about the Penguins being all the way back after a hard fought 2-1 victory last night over the Islanders, the Pacers beating the hell out of the Charlotte Hornets in the first play-in game, plus the unwritten rules of baseball being put into question after Tony La Russa got pissed about one of his players hitting a 3-0 homer in the 9th inning up by 12 runs, and if Shohei Ohtani is the greatest baseball player of all-time. Joining the program is ESPN MLB Insider and friend of the program, Jeff \"The Jett\" Passan to chat about people being pissed about the unwritten rules of baseball, and how the game is changing, he weighs in on the Ohtani debate, chats about which teams might be aggressive near the trade deadline, and who he thinks is going to win the World Series (21:55-39:59). Later, joining Pat and AJ Hawk to chat about last night's Penguins game in which he was in attendance is WWE Monday Night Raw broadcaster and friend of the program, Corey Graves to chat about the Penguins, his career in the WWE and how his new gig on Monday Night Raw is going, if he's going to be a WWE lifer, what the craziest moment of his career thus far has been, and if he ever has the itch to get back in the ring (1:03:44-1:34:26).
