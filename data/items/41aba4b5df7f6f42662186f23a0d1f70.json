  "description": "<p>On the first installment of BnB's Closer Look series, Avery and Codie discuss Kent Masterson Brown's new book <em>Meade at Gettysburg: A Study in Command</em>, and then offer their own evaluations of Union General George Gordon Meade's performance at the Battle of Gettysburg in July 1863. Not only was the battle Meade's first time commanding the Army of the Potomac, but he also took command just two days before the bloodiest battle of the American Civil War. Avery & Codie discuss Meade's highlights throughout the battle while they take on the old romanticized narrative of the campaign and how Meade was depicted. We hope you enjoy this new format because we plan on more \"Closer Looks\" to come. Enjoy!</p>",
