In this episode, we explore the brutal biology of the so-called ‘brain-eating amoeba’, walk through its recent but global history, and discuss the possible future of this pathogen, both good (e.g. treatments, awareness) and bad (e.g. climate change, land-use change).&nbsp;</p><p>Even though this is a very rare disease, its deadly potential is deeply felt by those impacted by it.
