  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Many people recommend artificial lighting to keep up egg production during the winter months, but this is hard on hens. Alternatively, I work with the seasons to allow the hens to produce eggs in their natural cycles. As a result, our homestead has high egg production in the spring, with low production in the winter. A critical homesteading skill is to learn which foods are seasonal, and some may be surprised to learn that eggs are seasonal too!
