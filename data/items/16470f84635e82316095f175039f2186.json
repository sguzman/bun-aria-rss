  "description": "It’s time to start thinking about the new Olympic cycle for figure skating. So, we asked two Olympic champions what they think Yuzuru Hanyu and Evgenia Medvedeva should do next.\nRussia’s Evgeni Plushenko (interview starts at 02:56) says that Hanyu is ‘from a different planet’. And hints that the Japanese double Olympic champion could be capable of doing the quad axel. Plushenko also says that if Medvedeva feels more comfortable training with coach Brian Orser then – why not?\nWe also spoke to USA’s Brian Boitano (interview starts at 11:10) who won gold against Brian Orser at Calgary 1988. He advises Hanyu against taking too much of a break from competitive skating. And he thinks that Medvedeva will become an even better skater after training with Boitano’s former rival Brian Orser.\nTwo exclusive interviews that you won’t see (or hear!) anywhere but Olympic Channel. If you liked this episode, we would love it if you gave it a five star review on iTunes or wherever you found us.\nSUBSCRIBE and you will never miss an episode of the Olympic Channel podcast. We want you to think just like an Olympian.\nLinks:\nHanyu interview in English from just after PyeongChang: https://www.olympicchannel.com/en/playback/listen-olympic-channel-podcast-ep20-with-hanyu-solo-wise/\nMedvedeva interview in English from Japan: https://www.olympicchannel.com/en/playback/olympic-channel-podcast/may/evgenia-medvedeva-a-russian-skater-on-the-move/\nPlushenko video interview: https://www.olympicchannel.com/en/playback/evgeni-plushenko-talks-yuzuru-hanyu-quads-and-the-future-of-figure-skating/\nFoul Play: Dutee https://www.olympicchannel.com/en/playback/foul-play/foul-play/foul-play-dutee/\nHere’s the Thing with Alec Baldwin: https://www.wnycstudios.org/shows/heresthething",
