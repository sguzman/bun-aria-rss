The two popular goals are as\nfollows.</p>\n<h2>1. Convey Variability</h2>\n<p>Here the focus is on the variability itself.\nFor example, take a look at this table of <a href=\"http://www.nature.com/ijo/journal/v27/n7/fig_tab/0802297t1.html\">food intake of\nUS teenagers</a>.\nThe variability among the participants of the study is reported through the\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_deviation\">standard deviation</a>, the\nsquare root of the variance.</p>\n<p>The reason why the standard deviation (SD) is prefered over the variance is\nthat the SD is on the same scale as the original values.  That is, if the\noriginal measurements were in <span class=\"math\">\\(\\textrm{Hz}\\)</span> the standard deviation is also in\nthe unit of <span class=\"math\">\\(\\textrm{Hz}\\)</span>, whereas the variance is the square.</p>\n<p>One easy question you can ask yourself when thinking about the results you\nwould like to report in an experiment is this:\nDo you expect the error bars to shrink with more available data?\nIf your goal is to convey variability they would <em>not</em> shrink but remain of a\ncertain size, no matter how many samples are available.</p>\n<p>The correct wording to report this type of uncertainty is something similar to</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"We report the mean and one unit standard deviation.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>2. Convey Uncertainty about an Unknown Parameter</h2>\n<p>Here the focus is on your remaining uncertainty about a fixed quantity which\ndoes not vary.\nFor example, take a look at <a href=\"http://loristalter.com/wp-content/uploads/CDC_1960_2002.pdf\">Table 1\nin Ogden et al.,\n2004</a> where the\naverage weight of US children is reported.\nTogether with the mean weight in pounds the authors report the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Standard_error\">standard error\nof the mean</a>.  (Sometimes this is\njust called standard error.)</p>\n<p>Here the uncertainty represents a measurement of uncertainty about the average\nweight.  It is related to the standard deviation <span class=\"math\">\\(\\sigma\\)</span> by means of</p>\n<div class=\"math\">$$\\textrm{SEM} = \\frac{\\sigma}{\\sqrt{n}},$$</div>\n<p>where <span class=\"math\">\\(n\\)</span> is the sample size of the experiment.  For example, in Table 1 of\nthe above paper the authors report that between 1963 and 1965 for boys of age\n6 years living in the USA the average weight was <span class=\"math\">\\(\\hat{\\mu}=48.4\\)</span> pounds with\n<span class=\"math\">\\(\\textrm{SEM}=0.3\\)</span> standard error of the mean and a sample size of <span class=\"math\">\\(n=575\\)</span>.\nUsing the above formula this immediately gives</p>\n<div class=\"math\">$$\\sigma \\approx \\sqrt{n} \\textrm{SEM} = \\sqrt{575} \\cdot 0.3 \\approx 7.19.$$</div>\n<p>What is the use of the standard error?\nBecause of the <a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Central_limit_theorem\">central limit\ntheorem</a> for independent\nsamples the standard error provides approximate confidence intervals for the\nunknown true mean of the population, as</p>\n<div class=\"math\">$$[\\hat{\\mu} - 1.96 \\textrm{SEM}, \\hat{\\mu} + 1.96 \\textrm{SEM}].$$</div>\n<p>Using the above numbers we then know that with 95% confidence over the\nsampling variation the true average weight <span class=\"math\">\\(\\mu \\in [47.8,49.0]\\)</span>.\n(Note that for a <em>single experiment</em> this does not mean we\n<a href=\"http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Coverage_probability\">cover</a> the true\nvalue with a certain probability, because either we cover it or we do not\ncover it.  The 95% probability is the probability associated to a\n(hypothetical) repetition of the experiment.)</p>\n<p>The correct wording to report this type of uncertainty is</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>\"We report the average of <span class=\"math\">\\(n=123\\)</span> samples and the standard error of the\nmean.\"</p>\n</blockquote>\n<h2>How many digits to report?</h2>\n<p>When writing out numbers a natural question that arises is how many\nsignificant digits to report.\n<a href=\"http://arxiv.org/abs/1301.1034\">Richard Clymo has some advice</a> on how many\ndigits to report.</p>\n<blockquote>\n<p>Most bioscientists need to report mean values, yet many have little idea of\nhow many digits are significant, and at what point further digits are mere\nrandom junk. Thus a recent report that the mean of 17 values was 3.863 with\na standard error of the mean (SEM) of 2.162 revealed only that none of the\nseven authors understood the limitations of their work.\nThe simple rule derived here by experiment for restricting a mean value to\nits significant digits (sig-digs) is this: the last sig-dig in the mean\nvalue is at the same decimal decade as the first sig-dig (the first\nnon-zero) in the SEM.\n...\nFor the example above the reported values should be a mean of 4 with SEM\n2.2. Routine application of these simple rules will often show that a result\nis not as compelling as one had hoped.</p>\n</blockquote>\n<p>Let's compare with the numbers from before: the average height was reported as\n48.4 and the SEM as 0.3.\nThe last significant digit in the mean is the four after the decimal point,\nand this is the same decimal decade as the first significant digit of the SEM.\nSo the study did it right.</p>\n<p>Clymo develops the following simple-to-follow rules for reporting the sample\naverage and SEM:</p>\n<ol>\n<li>\n<p><em>Rule 1</em> (for determining the significant digits in the reported mean):\nthe <em>last</em> significant digit in the mean is in the same decade as the <em>first</em>\nnon-zero digit in the SEM.</p>\n</li>\n<li>\n<p><em>Rule 2</em> (for determining significant digits in the reported SEM):\ndepending on the sample size <span class=\"math\">\\(n\\)</span>, as per the following table:</p>\n</li>\n</ol>\n<table>\n<thead>\n<tr>\n<th align=\"left\">Sample size <span class=\"math\">\\(n\\)</span></th>\n<th align=\"center\">Significant digits to report</th>\n</tr>\n</thead>\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><span class=\"math\">\\(2 \\leq n \\leq 6\\)</span></td>\n<td align=\"center\">1</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><span class=\"math\">\\(7 \\leq n \\leq 100\\)</span></td>\n<td align=\"center\">2</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><span class=\"math\">\\(101 \\leq n \\leq 10,000\\)</span></td>\n<td align=\"center\">3</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><span class=\"math\">\\(10,001 \\leq n \\leq 10^6\\)</span></td>\n<td align=\"center\">4</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td align=\"left\"><span class=\"math\">\\(n &gt; 10^6\\)</span></td>\n<td align=\"center\">5</td>\n</tr>\n</tbody>\n</table>\n<h2>Quiz</h2>\n<p>Ok, that is enough information.  Let's practice.</p>\n<h3>Question 1</h3>\n<p>You sample the height of male students in a German school class (grade 6)\nin centimeters: 148, 148, 137, 152, 140, 149, 152, 152, 159, 155.  Report your\nestimate of the population height (here the population is all German male\nstudents in grade 6).</p>\n<p><em>Answer</em>: <span class=\"math\">\\(149\\textrm{cm} \\pm 2.1\\textrm{cm}\\)</span> SEM.\nExplanation: we are interested in the population mean and hence would like to\nconvey the remaining uncertainty of our estimate.\nThe sample mean is <span class=\"math\">\\(\\hat{\\mu} \\approx 149.24467\\textrm{cm}\\)</span>, the standard\ndeviation is <span class=\"math\">\\(6.579429\\textrm{cm}\\)</span>, and the sample size is <span class=\"math\">\\(n=10\\)</span>.  This gives\na <span class=\"math\">\\(\\textrm{SEM} = 6.579429/\\sqrt{10} \\approx 2.080598\\)</span>.  Applying the above\nrules: Rule 1 tells us that the first significant digit is in the <span class=\"math\">\\(10^0\\)</span>\ndecade, so we report <span class=\"math\">\\(149\\textrm{cm}\\)</span> as mean.  Rule 2 tells us that for a\nsample size of <span class=\"math\">\\(n=10\\)</span> we should report two digits in the SEM, which needs to be\nproperly rounded to <span class=\"math\">\\(2.1\\textrm{cm}\\)</span>.</p>\n<h3>Question 2</h3>\n<p>You run a company and regularly send bills to customers for payment.\nYou measure the time in days between sending the bill and receiving the\npayment: 10, 7, 10, 7, 12, 10, 8, 4, 15, 3, 9, 4.  Report the average and\nvariability.</p>\n<p><em>Answer</em>: <span class=\"math\">\\(8 \\pm 3.5\\)</span> SD.\nExplanation: we are interested in the average time and the variability, so a\nstandard deviation is appropriate.  Rule 1 from Clymo still applies and we\ntruncate the sample mean of <span class=\"math\">\\(8.25\\)</span> after the first digit.  Rule 2 does not\napply (this is the standard deviation, not the SEM), but because we have\ntruncated the mean it makes no sense to be more accurate than the mean except\nfor one additional digit.</p>\n<script type=\"text/javascript\">if (!document.getElementById('mathjaxscript_pelican_#%@#$@#')) {\n    var align = \"center\",\n        indent = \"0em\",\n        linebreak = \"false\";\n\n    if (false) {\n        align = (screen.width < 768) ? \"left\" : align;\n        indent = (screen.width < 768) ? \"0em\" : indent;\n        linebreak = (screen.width < 768) ?
