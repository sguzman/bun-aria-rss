  "title": "Uncle Si's Hospital Shenanigans",
  "description": "Si is back, Jack!!! While he's new and improved, he's still recovering and feeling a little rough. Phillip and Si share some hilarious hospital stories, including stealing wheelchairs, putting on hospital gowns backwards, filling up bedpans, and accidentally calling for nurses 24/7. Si's wearing a cool black panther hat sent in by a fan — and all the boys are jealous. Martin and John-David help Si give advice on how to spend more time with your kids when you work a full week. John-David and Phillip talk about whether going to church is something you have to do. And thank you — everyone! — for keeping America's favorite uncle in your thoughts and prayers.\n\n\nDownload the Dave app from the App Store right now.
