  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, we bring you the Best of Mark Levin! Yale Professor Bandy X Lee, author of a book with several other Psychiatrists alleging that President Trump is dangerous, calls in to debate with Mark. According to Dr. Lee \"in 2015, the interactions I'd seen between candidate Trump and his rally attendees...it was disturbing.\" Then, latest national poll by Monmouth University shows a three-way tie for presidential Candidates Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren, and Joe Biden. However, contrary to what we’ve been told, the majority of Democrats (78%) do not support the abolition of private Healthcare which is what Medicare-For-All calls for. Such a healthcare proposal would increase income taxes by 216% for what Democrat call 'the middle class.' A federal wealth tax is how they plan to sell it, but this won't expand liberty and opportunity, this will only confiscate more earnings from people that the Democrats label as \"wealthy.\" This leaves the Democrats vulnerable to solely rely on reparations for the progeny of slaves, an interesting position for the Party that started the KKK, voted against the Civil Rights Act, and created the Jim Crow laws. Later, America's poorest citizens are wealthier than 60% of the rest of the developed world, yet the left continues to say that capitalism does not work. Again, this is the media lying to us about race, racism, hunger, poverty, and law enforcement.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
