    "media:description": "Don't sacrifice your body to save a few bucks. If you sit at your desk for long periods of time like me, you really should invest in a premium office chair that is comfortable and helps improve your posture. Bonus points if it looks good. After testing FlexiSpot's new Ergonomic Chair Pro, I can say that it checks all those boxes. For about $630, it's certainly not cheap but it could absolutely be worth the investment if you find yourself desk-bound for long periods of time. It's also worth noting that it's considerably cheaper than many of Herman Miller's offerings. \n\nFlexiSpot Ergonomic Chair Pro (OC14):\nhttps://bit.ly/3CrNa7K \n\nFlexiSpot Tech Day Sale:\nhttps://bit.ly/3QIPqvD \n\n#MyFlexiDesk #flexiblewfh\n\nSlashdot: https://www.slashdot.org\nTwitter: http://twitter.com/slashdot\nVideo Twitter: https://twitter.com/SlashdotTV\nMain Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/slashdot\nVideo Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/slashdottv\nSlashdot MERCH: https://www.slashdotstore.com/",
