  "description": "In their new book Diagramming the Big Idea (Routledge, 2012),  Jeffrey Balmer and Michael Swisher offer some new insights into the eternal problem of how creativity works. As you will hear in our interview, they are beginning design instructors and colleagues at University of North Carolina in Charlotte where they teach architecture students how to communicate their ideas and concepts through diagramming. The material for this book developed out of their teaching and a realization that students and professionals needed more resources to nurture their design thinking skills and methods. Of interest to both architects and anyone who wants to know more about the design process, this book explains how and why diagrams work, provides examples of successful diagramming strategies, and offers step-by-step instructions on how to make your own diagrams in two and three dimensions. The interview offers many insights into this fascinating and understudied topic.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
