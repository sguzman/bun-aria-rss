Jackie drops some serious wisdom about being afraid to pray, the addictiveness of social media, what God's holiness really means, why we choose idols over God, celebrity Christianity, and how she intentionally keeps others from placing her on a pedestal. She also addresses how the church can do better on the topic of homosexuality and engage in honest, kind, and Spirit-led conversations. \n-\nLearn more about your ad choices.
