There are others who believe that the school's reputation for hauntings is just that, a reputation. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of the Milton Schoolhouse. Moment in Oddity features the White Screamer and This Day in History features Washigton's troops entering Valley Forge.</p> <p>Check out the website:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/12/hgb-podcast-ep-90-milton-schoolhouse.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2015/12/hgb-podcast-ep-90-milton-schoolhouse.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer:  <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p> </p>",
