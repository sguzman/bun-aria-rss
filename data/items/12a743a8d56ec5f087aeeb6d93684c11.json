  "description": "Jimmy Russell, Master Distiller and Legend at Wild Turkey, sits down to tell his story. He thinks he’s “Plain Ol’ Jimmy” but once you hear his stories about childhood, befriending the likeness of greats in the industry, and sharing his wealth of knowledge you will see he really is an icon.\nShow Notes:\n\nI want to talk about your history before Wild Turkey.\n\nTalk a little bit about your childhood and upbringing. Sports, basketball, track, baseball.\n\nI know your father and grandfather were in this whiskey business, is that why you got into the bourbon industry?\n\nWere you always around bourbon?\n\nWhat made you come to Wild Turkey in beginning?\n\nWhat was the state of Wild Turkey when you joined?\n\nHow big was the operation?\n\nWho were your mentors?\n\nHow have you embraced a lot of modern distillation techniques with computers and automation taking over?\n\nWhat was life like for you before the boom?\n\nDid you ever make any radical changes to Wild Turkey?\n\nYou were best friends with the greatest minds in the industry before bourbon was cool. Talk about the comradery between people like you, Elmer, Booker, and the like.\n\nNow that bourbon is in the spotlight, are you hesitant on taking a backseat because at 82 years old, you won’t stop and you continue to travel to talk about Wild Turkey.\n\nYour son Eddie now has taken the spot light. What’s it mean to you that you get to trust the business to him?\n\nFrom @bourbonooga: Do they wish the old distillery was still down by where Warehouse A sits?\n\nFrom @Primo55: The eternal debate: Cheesy Gold Foil 12yr or Split Label 12 yr?\n\nWhat do you think is the best product that ever came out of here?\n\nGive us your thoughts on the 6-8 vs older aged bourbons?\n\nFrom @BreakingBourbon: Share a drink with anyone past/present/future who would it be and why?\n\nWhat are some of those things that you want to leave as a legacy?",
