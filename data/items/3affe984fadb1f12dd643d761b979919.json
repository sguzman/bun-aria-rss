  "description": "<p>This week the duo are joined by Kristen Korvette, author of Witches, Sluts and Feminists, a book on the sex positive history of female power and persecution. The group dives into the word \"SLUT\" and the shame placed on women for being sexually liberated. We discuss the history of slut shaming and how many of the things that happened centuries ago to women are still happening today. Also, is virginity a myth? Does virginity exist? We delve into the topic of virginity, toxic masculinity, and oh, alien porn! Another dope conversation and great discussion on sex, women, and empowerment! Love this week's guest?
