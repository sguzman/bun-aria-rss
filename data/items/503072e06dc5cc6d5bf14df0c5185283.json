  "description": "<p>Next week I will be traveling but I am going to pack my equipment and do some interviews. I am also going to try to do some video production.</p> <p>I am packing up for PhenomeCon. If you are going to be in Vernal Utah next week stop by and say hi. Tonight I will be posting a rewind one of my favorites. Something Out Of A Nightmare</p> <p>Bill writes “I was 15 it was second day of buck season. It was around 7am. It was snowing so the sun wasnt out full like usual. I heard what sounded to me like a damn bull running through the thickets. There was a deer run just next to it. My stand was about 25-30 yards from where the deer run shot through the thickets. I had clear shots all around. Our stands were built 360 around two giant oak trees.</p> <p>Anyway I was seriously waiting to see a damn brama bull come plowing through this scrub. So I sat on the bench up there and figured whatever it is my chance of getting a buck were gone for next few hours. So I leaned back against the tree and put my 30.06 across my lap. My dad insisted we always loaded heavy with hollow points. My dad reloaded all out ammo. I’m not sure what grain he used in the shells. But I know you couldn’t buy them with that much grain powder in them.</p> <p>Anyway. All sudden everything just goes silent. You know that Erie silence you hear when it is snowing. Like the snow absorbers all sound. No more birds, squirrels, nothing there was no sound. Lime mother nature hit the mute button. Then I saw movement. It was about 6 doe trying to sneak by. When they got near the thicket my jaw dropped. These doe jumped straight up in the air! And there legs were running in mid air as well. 4 doe sprinted away when the hoofs hit the ground. But what exploded out of the thorny thicket was these two massive BFs they were on top of these does in milliseconds grabbed them by the throats and snapped the does necks as if they were breaking twigs! These monsters were both reddish brown. Their faces were something out of nightmares. I froze. Did not move a muscle. I just watch as they threw these does probably about 150 pounds each over there should like I would have my book bag from school. And then they walked right under my stand. And stopped. Then what happened next it was all I could do not to piss myself. From right under me came this Unholy roar. That seemed to go on forever. The tree stand was vibrating from the sound waves. Then when the roast stopped, I heard the other go like humph!! And then they walked away with their prize over there shoulder. As they walked I watched them and it was if the trees swallowed them up and they were gone.</p> <p>Next I heard running towards my stand, but it wasnt heavy. It was my dad. He ran to me when he heard the roar. He was running towards me with the intent to shoot anything to save me. My dad did three tours in Vietnam. He was running as if he was going into battle. I didnt recognize it when I was 15, but after my training in the Navy. I was a Navy Corpsman with 2nd Marine recon battalion out of camp legune NC.</p> <p>When I saw there faces I became terrified because it triggered a memory from when I was like 5 or six. And something with that sinister face and teeth would stare through the window in my bedroom of that cabin. I was to terrified to run to my dad. I couldn’t even speak. I was frozen in fear. My mind must have blocked it out, until I saw them that day when I was 15.</p> <p>My dad had to climb up to me in the tree stand and assist me down the tree. It was if my brain locked every muscle in my body. I couldn’t even speak for about 10 minutes or so. I was in shock. That roar right under me sent a fear through every fiber in my mind body and soul.”</p>",
