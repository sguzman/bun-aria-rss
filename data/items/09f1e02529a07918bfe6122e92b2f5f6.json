  "description": "<p>Desire and Addiction: Voices of Longing Calling You Home (2020-03-04) - Desire is intrinsic to all living forms - the urge to exist and flourish. It turns to suffering when, due to unmet needs, it contracts, intensifies and separates us from our full aliveness and awareness. These two talks guide us in awakening from this trance, and discovering how within desire is the longing that can carry us to true belonging.</p> <p>Your support enables us to continue to offer these talks and meditations freely. If you value them, I hope you will consider offering a donation at this time at <a href= \"https://www.tarabrach.com/donation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">tarabrach.com/donation/</a>.<br /> With gratitude and love, Tara</p>",
