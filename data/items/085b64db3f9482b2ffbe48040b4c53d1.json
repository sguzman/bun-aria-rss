  "description": "Poet Laureate Joy Harjo says she loved poetry as a kid, but didn't feel like it belonged to her. \"It wasn't until I heard Native poets,\" she tells NPR's Michel Martin, \"that I realized that, wow, this is a powerful tool of understanding and affirmation. And I don't know, I just started writing.\" Harjo had been studying medicine, she says, and she knew her people needed doctors — but what about poets? Her new memoir <em>Poet Warrior</em> is a chronicle of pain and injustice, of growing up poor with an abusive stepfather — but also of poetry and discovery, of taking that pain and using it to make art.
