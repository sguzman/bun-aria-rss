  "description": "<p>A court has ruled that a Christian-owned business is not required to pay for health insurance that includes drugs to prevent HIV. Is the ruling a victory for religious liberty, or a case of Christians unfairly imposing their beliefs on others? In an effort to “bring God back into public schools\" Taxes now requires schools to display “In God We Trust” signs. But what happens when the sign is in Arabic? Southern governors are shipping undocumented immigrants North. But is their goal to actually solve the immigration crisis, or are they using vulnerable people for a partisan stunt? Then, pastor and culture-watcher Mark Sayers is back to talk about his new book, “A Non-Anxious Presence.” He says we’ve entered a new cultural era riddled with anxiety and uncertainty that Christian leaders relying on the previous era’s models are not equipped to handle. Drawing from Friedman’s family-systems theory, Sayers argues we must learn to patiently resist the unhealthy people in our communities, endure sabotage, and fundamentally rethink our definitions of success.
