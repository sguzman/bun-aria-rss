  "description": "<p>On another installment in the \"Battle Memory\" series, Avery and Codie are joined by Jake Wynn of the \"Wynning History\" blog and \"Pennsylvania in the Civil War\" page. Jake stuns Avery and Codie with the incredible accounts of Irvin Schwartz, who hailed from Schuylkill County, PA and went on to serve in the 26th Regiment of the 1st Infantry Division (The Big Red One) in the European Theater of World War II. Schwartz saw many significant actions during his time in Europe including the Normandy Invasion and the Battle of the Bulge, where he would have his most harrowing war experience yet. The guys discuss the importance of primary sources and how significant these types of accounts are in shaping our perceptions of major historical events. Avery & Codie also take the opportunity to promote Jake's new, upcoming podcast, \"The Gazette\", which will be an episodic telling of the American Civil War as it happened through the words of the Pittston Gazette. Check it out on both iTunes and Spotify and subscribe in the days to come! Enjoy!</p>",
