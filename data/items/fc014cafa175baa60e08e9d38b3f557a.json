  "description": "<p>On July 4, 2017, while Americans all over the United States were celebrating Independence Day with barbecues, fireworks, and quality family time, 9-year-old Kayla Unbehaun was spending time visiting her mother in Wheaton, Illinois.&nbsp;The following day, her father, Ryan Iskerka, left work and went to pick up his daughter, Kayla. However, when he arrived at Kayla’s mother’s residence, Kayla and her mother, Heather, were nowhere to be found. Heather’s father and uncle told Ryan that Heather had taken Kayla camping in Wisconsin but Ryan knew that something wasn’t right and immediately called police. In the 18 months that have passed since that day, Kayla and Heather have not been seen or heard from. Heather Unbehaun currently has an active warrant for felony kidnapping.</p><p>Link to more information on sovereign citizens: <a href=\"https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/stories/2010/april/sovereigncitizens_041310/domestic-terrorism-the-sovereign-citizen-movement\" target=\"_blank\">https://archives.fbi.gov/archives/news/stories/2010/april/sovereigncitizens_041310/domestic-terrorism-the-sovereign-citizen-movement</a></p><p>If you have any information about Kayla’s disappearance, please call the South Elgin Police Department at 847-741-2151.</p><p>You can follow Kayla's case on social media at <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Bring-Kayla-Home-1708410962798804/\" target=\"_blank\">Bring Kayla Home</a>.</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href=\"http://vanished.robinhood.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Robinhood</a>- <a href=\"http://vanished.robinhood.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Robinhood</a> is giving listeners a FREE stock like Apple, Ford or Sprint to help build your portfolio!
