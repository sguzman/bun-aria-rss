  "description": "<p><em>Behind the Series</em> is a short-run series about the shows previously featured on this very podcast: <em>Showcase</em> from Radiotopia. This week, we revisit <em>The Polybius Conspiracy.</em> Initially released in 2017, this seven-part series told the creepy story surrounding a mind-altering arcade game from the 1980s and the quest of protagonist Bobby Feldstein to find vindication for an alleged abduction and assault he linked to playing the mysterious <em>Polybius</em>. Four years later, producers Jon Frechette and Todd Luoto look back and offer thoughts about the show’s murky narrative—sharing how they crafted a documentary/fiction hybrid that paid homage to an urban legend and what they learned about audience expectations in the process. </p>\n\n<p><em>Behind the Series</em> is hosted, written, and produced by Mark Pagán. Executive producers are Audrey Mardavich and Julie Shapiro. Music from JD Samson and Blue Dot Sessions.  </p>\n\n<p><em>Behind the Series</em> is a production of <em>Showcase</em>, from PRX’s Radiotopia.
