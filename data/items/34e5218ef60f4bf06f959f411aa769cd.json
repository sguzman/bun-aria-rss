  "description": "<p>Robyn is a Swedish singer and songwriter. Her first album came out in 1995, when she was 16 years old. It went platinum in the US, double-platinum in Sweden. Since then, she’s been nominated for five Grammys and started her own record label. But there was an eight-year gap between Robyn’s album <em>Body Talk</em>, which came out in 2010, and her most recent album, <em>Honey</em>, which came out last October. <em>Time</em>, <em>Rolling Stone</em>, and <em>Pitchfork</em> all named it one of the best albums of the year.</p>\n\n<p>For Song Exploder, Robyn breaks down the song “Honey,” the title track from that album. The first time the public heard the song was in a 2017 episode of the HBO show <em>Girls</em>, but that’s not the final version that was released on the album. In this episode, Robyn traces the long history of how she made “Honey,” a song that <em>The New York Times</em> called “her masterpiece.”</p>\n\n<p><a href=\"http://songexploder.net/robyn\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">songexploder.net/robyn</a></p>",
