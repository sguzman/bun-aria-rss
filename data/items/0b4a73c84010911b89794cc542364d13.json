This one has it all.</p>\n\n\n<p>Christian Gerhartsreiter, a man eventually known as \"Clark Rockefelle,\" lived a life of deception; the FBI called it \"the longest-running con in FBI history.\" After ingratiating himself into New York society and marrying a top banker with a Harvard MBA, \"Clark\" settled into his new luxurious life. The two had a daughter before they divorced after 13 years. When his wife won custody, a distraught Clark abducted his beloved daughter.
