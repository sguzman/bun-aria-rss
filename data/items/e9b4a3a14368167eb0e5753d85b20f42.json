  "description": "<p>A general entanglement-based witness of non-classicality has recently been\nproposed, which can be applied to testing quantum effects in gravity. This\nwitness is based on generating entanglement between two quantum probes via a\nmediator. In this paper we provide a \"temporal\" variant of this witness, using\na single quantum probe to assess the non-classicality of the mediator. Within\nthe formalism of quantum theory, we show that if a system $M$ is capable of\ninducing a coherent dynamical evolution of a quantum system $Q$, in the\npresence of a conservation law, then $M$ must be non-classical. This argument\nsupports witnesses of non-classicality relying on a single quantum probe, which\ncan be applied to a number of open issues, notably in quantum gravity or\nquantum biology.\n</p>",
