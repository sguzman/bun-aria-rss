  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin show, free speech is under attack. Twitter has suspended President Trump's account indefinitely and Apple is threatening to suspend Parler from its App Store. Parler investor Dan Bongino joins the show to explain how today's digital town square is under siege. Publishers like the New York Times are liable for what they publish. Platforms like Twitter and Parler are currently exempt from liability due to Section 230. The left favors monopolies and hates competition. So in response to the fascistic policies at Twitter, Mark Levin has voluntarily suspended its Twitter account. Then, in one of Nancy Pelosi's last political breaths, she and the Democrats are now insisting on impeaching Trump for a second time falsely claiming that he has called an insurrection on Capitol Hill. Yet, Pelosi incited an insurrection calling federal police \"storm troopers\" and assaulted our Constitution by allowing the attack on federal courts. Kamala Harris called for continued riots this summer, should she be impeached too? Marxist progressivism is incompatible with Constitutionalism. Marxists reject the principles of God-given rights, private property, and the founding of our country. Tens of millions of Americans support our country, the Constitution, and President Trump who won the White House in 2016, fair and square. Their goal is to silence all dissent and weaken our liberties like free speech and self-protection. Constitutionalists reject violence, and the neo-Marxists welcome the overturning of America's Constitutional system. Later, Jason Whitlock, founder of the sports and culture website Outkick, agrees that Trump was part of the reason for Wednesday's chaos, but that it wasn't solely Trump. Whitlock added that Trump supporters have been ostracized and that big tech and others are drunk on the power they have.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
