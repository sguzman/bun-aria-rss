  "description": "<p>Whether men and women should handle their money differently is an important question to ask. There are a lot of different studies and surveys out there that show that your gender has a pretty large impact on how you earn, spend, save, and invest your money- but should it? After all money is money! And of course there are generalities made in these studies because obviously we’re all individuals and handle money in our own unique ways. But that being said, there are still things we can learn from the data about the views, tendencies, and actions of each gender in the realm of personal finance. Recognizing these things will allow us to understand others better, we’ll do a better job at raising our children to handle money well, and we might even gain a better insight of ourselves along the way.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed an On Cassette by New Anthem.
