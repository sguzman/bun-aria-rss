  "description": "It's the last episode of 2020 and The Readheads are recapping and discussing one of their favorite books they've read this year, The Invisible Life of Addie LaRue by V. E. Schwab. They're talking about the story, the main characters and which curse they'd prefer, Addie's or Henry's. Plus they're sharing their casting picks for a movie adaption of this book (which is happening by the way)! In the second half of the episode the girls share their favorite Readheads books of the year and their favorite non-Readheads books they read this year. We hope you enjoy this episode and we want to say thank you for joining our book club this year! We have loved reading and discussing these books with all of you and we are so excited to read even more in 2021. The next book is Margo's choice and she chose Layla by Colleen Hoover.
