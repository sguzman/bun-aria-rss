  "description": "Christmas season is here… and I love this time of year—not just for the holidays, but because I get to attend the annual Consumer Electronics Show (CES) held in Las Vegas every January. Be sure to  by January 5 to get my most important updates on CES 2022… including the latest tech set to take the world by storm. [0:35] After finally admitting inflation isn’t transitory during last month’s policy meeting, the Federal Reserve has some difficult decisions to make as it gathers for its final meeting of the year… One investment bank is predicting nearly a dozen rate hikes over the next three years. While Daniel and I have different takes, we do agree: The Fed must act aggressively… Here’s what that means for 2022 market conditions. [4:25] Last week, executives from six large crypto firms appeared on Capitol Hill for a hearing on the future of crypto regulation. Daniel explains why the hearing has him more bullish on crypto than ever. [15:45] Pfizer (PFE) released positive results for its COVID pill. This is, of course, great news—but it doesn’t mean COVID is going away… [22:45] Finally, Daniel and I each share a stock we're excited about for 2022. [26:35] Enjoyed this episode?
