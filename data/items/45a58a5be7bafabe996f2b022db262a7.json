  "description": "<p><em>For 20+ years, Rush Limbaugh created his daily program from the “EIB Southern Command”. There were just four people present each day, including Rush. Meet and hear from the other three, including podcast host James Golden, as they describe the person off the air as he prepared his daily program. It’s different than what you might expect. The areas explored – such as Rush’s hearing loss in late 2001 – have never been revealed nor has how Rush overcame that obstacle. It’s rare that three individuals would share that kind of space day in / day out for two decades, but then again everything about the man behind the Golden EIB Microphone is special. This episode also features a special appearance by program guest host alum Mark Steyn, who provides additional insights into Rush’s life, as well.</em></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
