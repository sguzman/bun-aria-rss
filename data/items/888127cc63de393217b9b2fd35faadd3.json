  "description": "<p>Exactly soluble models can serve as excellent tools to explore conceptual\nissues in non-perturbative quantum gravity. In perturbative approaches, it is\nonly the two radiative modes of the linearized gravitational field that are\nquantized. The goal of this investigation is to probe the `Coulombic' aspects\nof quantum geometry that are governed entirely by matter sources. Since there\nare no gravitational waves in 3 dimensions, 3-d gravity coupled to matter\nprovides an ideal arena for this task. Our analysis will reveal novel aspects\nof quantum gravity that bring out limitations of classical and semi-classical\ntheories in unforeseen regimes: non-linearities of general relativity can\nmagnify small quantum fluctuations in the matter sector to large effects in the\ngravitational sector. Finally, this analysis leads to thought experiments that\nbring out rather starkly why understanding of the nature of physical reality\ndepends sensitively on the theoretical lens with which it is probed. As\ntheories becomes richer, new scales emerge, triggering novel effects that could\nnot be imagined before. The model provides a concise realization of this\nwell-known chain.\n</p>",
