  "description": "In this episode, Stephen A., Dan Orlovsky, and \"The Playmaker\" Michael Irvin debate whether or not Patrick Mahomes put Kansas City's offensive concerns to bed with his 3 touchdown performance in last night's win against Tom Brady and the Bucs. Plus, did Harbaugh make a grave mistake in going for it on 4th & goal in Baltimore's last second loss to Buffalo? Our guys disagree with each other on this one. Irvin is here to make it known that Cooper Rush is the truth, but Stephen A. still isn't sold on the 4-0 backup QB. And, the crew debates if Green Bay should feel good about their OT win against the Patriots and their 3rd-string quarterback on Sunday.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
