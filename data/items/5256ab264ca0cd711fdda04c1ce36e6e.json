  "description": "On today's show, Pat and the guys chat about Tiger winning his first tournament in forever, dive into week 3 of the NFL including the Chiefs and Rams maybe being unbeatable, whether or not Patrick Mahomes is the new prototype, Josh Allen winning in Minnesota, and The For The Brand Super Bowl in Jacksonville.. Also joining the show is 5x Pro Bowler and 5x All-Pro, and current safety for the Baltimore Ravens, Eric Weddle. They discuss whether the game has gotten soft, his foray into free agency, and what's next for him (39:08-57:29). Next, the blogfather, Mike Florio, joins the show to chat about the Everson Griffin situation in Minnesota, reporters bringing up old news and repackaging it as breaking news, and how he thinks the Steelers are going to move forward with Lev Bell (1:05:41-1:19:10). Lastly, Cleveland Browns legend, and the greatest offensive lineman of all-time, Joe Thomas, joins to chat about the Browns first win (1:19:58-1:26:28). It's a good one. Cheers.\n",
