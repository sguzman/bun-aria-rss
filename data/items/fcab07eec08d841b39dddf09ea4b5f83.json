  "description": "It has long been a foundational belief of political smarties everywhere that the average American does not give a hoot about foreign policy. But that, according to a new study from the Center for American Progress, is just not true. Maybe 20 percent don't give a hoot. And about 30 percent are nutty nationalists. But 50 percent are more in the internationalist vein which could have big implications for the 2020 elections. We discuss with CAP's Brian Katulis, Georgetown Law's Rosa Brooks and the German Marshall Fund's Evelyn Farkas. (And while we're at it, we throw in a little Iran, Israel, North Korea and Venezuela for good measure. Tune in!)\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
