  "description": "The past four years have left deep scars in the United States. Damage has been done. So can a new administration come in and restore America's role in the world overnight? Just because it wants to? Just because it has experienced senior officials leading the way? Just because the new US president is a foreign policy expert? The short and perhaps somewhat surprising answer is...yes. Yes, the changes will be big, swift and the world is already starting to notice. We discuss the whys and whos and hows of this with Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute, Tom Nichols of the US Naval War College and David Sanger of the New York Times. Don't miss this discussion that kicks off a new era in US history. \nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
