  "description": "<p>The guest has been a long time coming but we finally have the incredible Koji a solo artist from Pennsylvania, on the show this week. He's an incredibly thoughtful guy that gave me a lot of time for us to discuss being an outsider, self-examination and continually keeping active. Not only does he create compelling music, but he is very passionate about creating communities around activism and ideas outside of music. He's a very valuable member of our independent music community and I hope you enjoy this conversation.
