  "description": "<p>Every day, your brain tries to save your life by being terrified. Thanks, brain! Also, calm the f*ck down, brain. In 2018, Alie hunted down Mary Poffenroth, an expert in the biological and sociological causes/effects of fear -- and it is riveting. This December, <a href=\"https://time.com/5524332/best-podcasts-to-listen-to/\">Time Magazine named Ologies a top podcast</a> and recommended this episode specifically. Plus it just so happens that there was an administrative snafu with the podcast network and we're not supposed to have new episodes for two weeks, so enjoy this encore of a truly life changing episode. This actual FEAROLOGIST (which is a real word) talks about how fear is literally killing you, the difference between stress and fear, how to get along with your co-workers, friends, or partner better, and how to talk to your brain when it has needlessly pulled the fire alarm. Part 1 of a 2-part series that will honestly change your life.</p><p>For more info on Mary Poffenroth, see her <a href=\"https://www.MaryPoffenroth.com\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/marypoffenroth\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MaryPoffenroth\">Twitter</a> or <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/fearforward/\">Instagram</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.alieward.com/ologies/fearology\" target=\"_blank\">More episode sources & links</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.alieward.com/ologies-sponsors\" target=\"_blank\">Sponsors of Ologies</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.alieward.com/ologies-extras\" target=\"_blank\">Transcripts & bleeped episodes</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/ologies\" target=\"_blank\">Support Ologies on Patreon</a> for as little as a buck a month</p><p><a href=\"https://www.ologiesmerch.com\" target=\"_blank\">OlogiesMerch.com</a> has hats, shirts, pins, totes!</p><p>Follow @Ologies on <a href=\"http://twitter.com/ologies\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ologies\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></p><p>Follow @AlieWard on <a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/alieward\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alieward\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></p><p>Sound editing by <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stevenRayMorris\">Steven Ray Morris</a></p><p>Theme song by Nick Thorburn</p>\n",
