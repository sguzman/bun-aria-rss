  "title": "Behind The Idea #96: Teladoc And The Modern Growth Story",
  "description": "There are three sorts of stories we've gravitated towards in the past 95 episodes of Behind the Idea:\n\nValue traps and/or value plays, the sorts of junk we might invest in. Examples: Cars.com (CARS), AT&T (T), Dell (DELL), Kelloggs (K) from the short side.\n\nGrowth stories that break our value-oriented brains. Examples: Amazon (AMZN), Shopify (SHOP), Crowdstrike (CRWD), Lyft (LYFT), PagerDuty (PD) from the short side.\n\nBattleground stories or news stories. Examples: Boeing (BA), PG&E (PCG), Chipotle (CMG), Trupanion (TRUP).\n\n\nThis week we cover Teladoc (TDOC), which falls squarely in categories 2 and 3. The company is a fast grower on the top line, but it's yet to crack break even profitability metrics. We've published many short ideas on the company on Seeking Alpha, but we recently published a PRO+ top idea by Value Alpha that takes the long side. As with many of these stories, there are both exciting things going on and questions raised that deserve a closer look.\nWe break down the long case, and then we raise our questions. Beyond assessing the Teladoc story itself, we also get into what we look for in growth stories like this, and what it means to invest in an execution based story. \nTopics Covered\n3:00 - Assessing the long case\n\n8:15 - Market leadership and the total addressable market story\n\n13:45 - Teladoc's revenue model and Value Alpha's valuation model.\n\n19:00 - Pricing vs. valuation rears its head\n\n22:00 - Teladoc's industry position and is it a real moat?\n\n27:45 - Valuation arbitrage and the messiness in the story\n\n31:00 - What about the short case?\n\n36:30 - The significance of the 'execution-based' story\n\n40:00 - The reliance on acquisitions and the trends in visit fees.",
