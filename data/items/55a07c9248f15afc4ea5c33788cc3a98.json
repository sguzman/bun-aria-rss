    "media:description": "When did Christians start giving Christmas presents? This video explains the origins of giving Christmas presents. The tradition of trees, Santa, and giving presents on Christmas morning comes from the 1800s. Traditional Christmas seasons saw events in town squares, but the 19th century moved Christmas to the home. This video explains how Christmas presents and giving became part of our culture today.\n\nFor books on Christmas, see:\n\nStephen Nissenbaum ‘The Battle for Christmas’: http://amzn.to/2i7vVQx \nBruce David Ford ‘Christmas: A Candid History’: http://amzn.to/2icQKGv \n\nRyan M.
