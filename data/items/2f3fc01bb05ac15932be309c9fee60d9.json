  "description": "<p>Do you remember the Seinfeld ‘car reservation’ episode? It’s one of the best. Jerry gets to the car rental counter and they don’t have a car for him. He says “See you know how to take a reservation, you just don’t know how to hold the reservation. And that’s really the most important part of the reservation, the holding!” That’s what we’re talking about today because you might know how to get <em>out</em> of debt, but do you know how to <em>stay</em> out of debt? You might find yourself digging out of debt every year when January rolls around. Holiday spending has a habit of sneaking up on most folks and you might be dealing with that financial hangover right now. Listen as we tackle concepts like lifestyle inflation, stoicism, accountability, and other practices that will allow us to kick debt to the curb for good.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed an Empress Rising Mole by Birds Fly South!
