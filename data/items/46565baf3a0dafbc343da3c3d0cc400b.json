  "description": "<p>In the 1970’s Jackson Browne was known as one of the originators of the carefree, California classic rock sound with hits like “Doctor My Eyes” and “Running on Empty.” As his career progressed, Jackson Browne’s knack for writing soul-searching lyrics turned more political. Browne continues to use his music as a vehicle for change today. His latest album, <em>Downhill From Everywhere</em>, was inspired by a documentary about the Pacific garbage patch and our impact on the planet.</p><p>On today’s episode Bruce Headlam talks to Jackson Browne about how he is able to turn catastrophic headlines into palatable songs. Browne also talks about moving to New York City when he was 18 and how he ended up writing songs for the Velvet Underground’s Nico. And Browne remembers the time his former label boss, David Geffen, shut down his attempt to quote the Black Panthers’ Bobby Seale in a song.</p><p><br></p><p>Subscribe to Broken Record’s YouTube channel to hear all of our interviews: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast\"> https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast</a> and follow us on Twitter <a href=\"https://twitter.com/BrokenRecord\">@BrokenRecord</a></p><p>You can also check out past episodes here:<a href=\"https://brokenrecordpodcast.com/\"> https://brokenrecordpodcast.com</a></p><p>Check out our favorite Jackson Browne songs<a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/1fQGMcdRz00dBClVubZOhi?si=051250b08a314c95&pt=68f728231727c7e95b70bdde058c2f8d\"> HERE.</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
