  "description": "<p>Many cemeteries have been designed to serve as parks. They have many features that we would find in large public parks like statuary, stone architecture, large trees, lush landscaping and beautiful flowers. For taphophiles, cemeteries offer a place of adventure and discovery, whether it is seeking out a specific burial plot or figuring out the meaning of the symbology we find there. For genealogists, cemeteries offer a way to track down ancestors and trace their movements. For historians, cemeteries are a giant story and record of an area. On this episode we are going to discuss cemeteries in general, including the architecture found there, the meaning of the symbols, the materials used and why we love them so much. We also will share the history and hauntings of a couple of cemeteries in Windham, Maine: Chute Road and Anderson, and Hookman's Cemetery in Connecticut. Joining us on this episode is author and historian Annette Student. Listener Suzanne Silk suggested the topic of cemetery symbology and designed our Cemetery Bingo Cards. The Moment in Oddity features a Viking leader killed by a tooth in a severed head and This Month in History features the publishing of the first multi-page American newspaper. This episode is dedicated to Dannah Jones, gone too soon.</p> <p>For your copy of Cemetery Bingo, email us at <a href= \"mailto:historygoesbump@gmail.com\">historygoesbump@gmail.com</a> or join the Spooktacular Crew: <a href= \"https://www.facebook.com/groups/815535518467637/\">https://www.facebook.com/groups/815535518467637/</a></p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes and pictures can be found here: <a href= \"https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2017/09/hgb-ep-224-haunted-cemeteries-4.html\"> https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2017/09/hgb-ep-224-haunted-cemeteries-4.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer and open up a world of rewards: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p> </p>",
