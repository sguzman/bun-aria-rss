  "description": "Anthony Kronman, former dean of Yale Law School, has written an account of his view of the decline of the American university from a bastion of free inquiry and an arena for the pursuit of excellence to become a vocational training school and mere reflection of the wider society. In The Assault on American Excellence (Free Press, 2019), Professor Kronman contends that this is a failure by faculty and administrators to provide students with the intellectual and moral challenges they need in order become a fully-formed human being. He reviews recent controversies happening at his school, Yale University, such as the debate over the name of Calhoun College and student and faculty objections to the use of the term “master” to describe the faculty head of a residential college. Kronman’s book is his response to what he sees as a crisis in higher education and an argument in favor of encouraging students, faculty, administrators and members of the general public to viewing college as a unique opportunity to pursue excellence in all its forms.\nIan J. Drake is an Associate Professor of Political Science and Law at Montclair State University. His scholarly interests include American legal and constitutional history and political theory.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
