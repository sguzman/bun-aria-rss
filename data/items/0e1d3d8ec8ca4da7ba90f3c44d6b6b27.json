  "description": "<p>Why is it that some people experience terrible, evil things in their lives & they become monsters themselves...while other people go through just the same kind of suffering & sh*t & they are transformed into amazing, good people? I get it. It is hard to take the negatives of life & convert them into positives. It's hard to be wronged & still do the right thing. It's really hard to go through really bad things & become a force for good in the world. But it can be done. You just have to make the choice.</p>",
