And in smaller countries like Haiti and Cuba other kinds of unrest is\nunfolding. What can and should the US do? What about the rest of the hemisphere? And what will the region's number one trading and investment partner,\nChina, do going forward? We discuss with Council on Foreign Relations Latin America expert Shannon O'Neil and Ed Luce of the\nFinancial Times. Don't miss this episode.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
