  "description": "On this episode of The Colin and Samir Podcast, we’re joined by the youngest guest we’ve had on the show, Braxton Haugen. Braxton is a filmmaker and YouTuber based in Oregon, he has a long history of working in entertainment, more specifically in television. He’s 18 years old but as you’ll hear on this podcast, he’s wise beyond his years.\nWe met Braxton because he wrote an article about us, and it was so well written that we schedule a Skype call to learn more about him. On that call Braxton told us that if we ever needed help with anything, he’d fly out to LA and work with us…so a few weeks later Braxton landed in Los Angeles to help us with our new show, The Breakdown.\nOver the past two weeks, we’ve put out 2 episode of the show and learned a lot about the production process. But the most important part of the experience was getting to know Braxton and learning how to collaborate, which turned out to be a seamless process.\nHe’s extremely talented, he's well spoken and we’re excited to introduce all of you to Braxton Haugen.\nBraxton's YouTube channel: YouTube.com/BraxtonHaugen\nBraxton's Twitter: https://twitter.com/BraxtonHaugen",
