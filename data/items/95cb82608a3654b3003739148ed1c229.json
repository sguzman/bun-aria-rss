  "description": "<p>Ryan Leslie is known for being a legend in the music industry as a Grammy nominated producer, singer and rapper. He's had hit records of his own and has worked with some of the biggest names in music history including Kanye West, Diddy, Rick Ross, Fabolous, Cassie and Nipsey Hussle. His genius reaches far past music. He scored a perfect score on his S.A.T. at fourteen and went on to graduate from Harvard University. He has always been ahead of his time. He was one of the first artists to give his fans his phone number as a way to have a direct relationship with his supporters. He shocked the music industry in 2012 when he took his music off of streaming services and as a result, he made more money. Now he is focused on his latest venture called Super Phone, which is a text message data management system that he expects will change the way we communicate with each other. His goal is to be the next tech giant and change the world in the process. On episode 64 , Ryan discusses all of the aforementioned topics and much more, for one of our most broad-ranging conversations ever. #techstartup #marketing EYL Website: https://www.earnyourleisure.com/ Guest IG: @ryanleslie Book Tip: The Intelligent Investor Brand Resumes: https://brandresumes.com/eyl/ --- This episode is sponsored by · Anchor: The easiest way to make a podcast. <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/app\">https://anchor.fm/app</a> Support this podcast: <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/earnyourleisure/support\">https://anchor.fm/earnyourleisure/support</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
