  "description": "<p>Ryan Selkis is the Founder and CEO the crypto data analytics platform Messari. Last time Ryan was on the podcast, we debated Ether’s properties as a money and the triple point asset thesis. We revisit many of these topics and explore what has changed in the landscape over the past year.</p> <p>However, we also discuss a perhaps more pressing issue: the state of regulation for the industry. Ryan is poised to take a strong leadership role in the political side of crypto, and he’s developing offensive strategies for the crypto vs. nation-state conflict. Listen in to learn why he’s now a single-issue voter.</p> <p>------<br /> 🚀 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER: <a href= \"https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/\">https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/</a> <br />  🎙️ SUBSCRIBE TO PODCAST: <a href= \"http://podcast.banklesshq.com/\">http://podcast.banklesshq.com/</a> <br />  🎖 CLAIM YOUR BADGE: <a href= \"https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/-guide-2-using-the-bankless-badge\"> https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/p/-guide-2-using-the-bankless-badge</a> <br />  ------<br /> BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS:</p> <p>⚖️ ARBITRUM | SCALING ETHEREUM<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum\">https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum</a> </p> <p>🍵 MATCHA | DECENTRALIZED EXCHANGE AGGREGATOR<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Matcha\">https://bankless.cc/Matcha</a> </p> <p>🔐 LEDGER | SECURE YOUR ASSETS<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Ledger\">https://bankless.cc/Ledger</a> </p> <p>🦄 UNISWAP | DECENTRALIZED FUNDING<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/UniGrants\">https://bankless.cc/UniGrants</a> </p> <p>------<br /> 📣 TracerDAO | Building DeFi Infrastructure.
