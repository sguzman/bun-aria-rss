  "description": "On Wednesday’s Mark Levin Show, it’s curious that we now have three accusers of Brett Kavanaugh at the 11th hour with no specifics and no corroboration. All three accusers are being used by the Democrats and tainted by their antics, so why should we believe their flimsy allegations? There’s 3 remarkable similarities among the Kavanaugh allegations: No witnesses, no corroboration, no evidence. That’s the pattern. If Kavanaugh were a left-wing judge nominated by Barack Obama, the media would be defending him instead of dragging him through the mud. This is not only about destroying Kavanaugh’s reputation and sinking his nomination – it’s a warning to all conservatives and President Trump nominees that coming forward means they’ll have their reputations destroyed by Democrats. Finally, the ex-boyfriend of Julie Swetnick, Kavanaugh’s third accuser, had a restraining order filed against her in 2001 for making threats against him and his family. She’s being represented by Michael Avenetti which already questions her credibility.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
