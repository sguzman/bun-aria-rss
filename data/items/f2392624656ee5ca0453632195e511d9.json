    "media:description": "Hi i'm hamsterLAB\nThe name of the hamster in the video is Cotton or Som e in Korean.\n\nI previously made a Pond in True Naturalistic Hamster TERRARIUM\nBut there was no water filter in the pond. So the hamster could not drink the pond water, but now the hamster can enjoy the pond by making it.\n The existence of a pond made it possible to create an ecology around the pond. We plan to add shrimp and fish to the pond, so stay tuned.\n\nThank you for watching.\n\n\n#hamster #terrarium #pond\n\n===========================\nBlog : https://blog.naver.com/aidigi123\ninstagram : https://www.instagram.com/hamster_lab1/",
