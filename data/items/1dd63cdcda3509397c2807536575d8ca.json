  "description": "hi. for the next two episodes i'm going to be doing a little two part series about failure. i wanted to do this because i think it's really easy to forget that failing in anything in life doesn't define you. it doesn't make you a permanently evil person, it doesn't make you a permanent loser or a permanent idiot. failing actually has a crucial role in becoming a better you in all areas of life. i think a lot of us know that, but it's easy to forget. so today i want to remind you, and talk about failing as a human being...about personal failure to yourself and others. we'll go over types of personal failure, the lessons we learn from failure, how to handle it and move on from it, failure in relationships and more.\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
