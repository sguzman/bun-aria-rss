  "description": "<p>I met this week&rsquo;s guest whilst filming an episode of Ari Shaffir&rsquo;s <em>This is Not Happening. </em>He immediately stood out as a great storyteller and overall good human being by the name of Gastor Almonte. He co-hosts a great podcast called <em>The War Report </em>(with 5 Words alum Shalewe Sharpe from episode ). We really chow down on some conversation here, and I believe we lay the foundation for our own religion&mdash;one where no one ever dies unless they&rsquo;re an asshole. It&rsquo;s a great episode, and here are five words to describe it: just buy a fucking house.</p>",
