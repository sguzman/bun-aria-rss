Soul legend Bill Withers passed away and The Crew share their favorite songs from the late great singer. We have a statuation which really means stay your @$$ at the house inside Church Complaints. Disco-funk producer Vaughn Mason who is best known for the single \"Bounce, Rock, Skate, Roll\" passed away Thursday at age 69 from natural causes. A tiger from the NYC Zoo has tested positive for coronavirus. Toni Braxton stops by the show to talk about her latest song \"Do It\" and more. Last week we got a little poetry from Samuel L. Jackson and Junior is back with poetry of his own.  We give a huge shout out to a former set designer for Steve.  Today's Closing Remarks has the crew talking about what would happen if this lock down lasted until 2021, plus more.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
