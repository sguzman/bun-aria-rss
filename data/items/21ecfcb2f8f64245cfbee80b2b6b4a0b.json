  "description": "<p>Alaska is a land just ripe for hauntings. Darkness cloaks the land for much of the year and thick pine forests spread across the expanse. There are legends that have filtered down through the various cultures and time periods, passed around by the Inuit, the gold miners, the trappers, the explorers or the soccer moms. Anchorage grew from a tent city to a major American city. The city has experienced much history and this may be why several locations here are rumored to be haunted. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of Anchorage, Alaska! Moment in Oddity was suggested by Chelsea Flowers and features the Mycenaean Bridge of Kazarma and This Month in History features the opening of the Suez Canal.</p> <p>This episode's sponsor is HelloFresh.
