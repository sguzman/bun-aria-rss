When Mike Anthony’s father unexpectedly died, his family was left shocked and utterly devastated. However, when a phone call came out of the blue delivering a complete stranger’s message that Mike’s dad had contacted her from “the other side,” it kicked off a chain of events that entirely changed Mike’s family’s perspective on life, death, and the transcendent nature of love. Join us on his remarkable quest, as his skeptical mindset gets challenged and eventually overruled through an extraordinary journey, leading to something that would forever change his understanding of reality.<br>\n<br>\nGet the book Love, Dad: How my Father Died...Then Told Me He Didn't: here: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3tgjhPO\">https://amzn.to/3tgjhPO</a></p>\n",
