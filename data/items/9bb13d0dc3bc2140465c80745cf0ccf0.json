  "description": "<p>With the growing use of deep learning methods, particularly graph neural\nnetworks, which encode intricate interconnectedness information, for a variety\nof real tasks, there is a necessity for explainability in such settings. In\nthis paper, we demonstrate the applicability of popular explainability\napproaches on Graph Attention Networks (GAT) for a graph-based super-pixel\nimage classification task. We assess the qualitative and quantitative\nperformance of these techniques on three different datasets and describe our\nfindings. The results shed a fresh light on the notion of explainability in\nGNNs, particularly GATs.\n</p>",
