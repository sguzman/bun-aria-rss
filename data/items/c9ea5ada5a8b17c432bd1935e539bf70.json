  "description": "<div>I almost forgot about the election that saved comedy. Not the presidential election. No, that doesn't really matter. We're still gonna be at war with 7 countries and watch the rich get richer and the poor get poorer regardless of who won that. I'm talking about the Legion of Skanks election. I decided to run for the president of someone else's podcast.</div> <div> </div> <div>I'm Ari Shaffir, and I stand for Mayhem.</div> <div> </div> <div>Every week, I would offer a different sacrifice at the alter of comedy. And in return, the gods of laughs rewarded me with the highest office in the land. During this recap, I didn't even remember some of the best stuff that happened. There was way more about this than I remembered while avoiding sheep poop. I forgot making Derosa wait downstairs in the sweaty basement just to get betrayed like a chump when he came upstairs. I forgot getting the best celebrity endorsements and then getting Big Jay's family and Luis's son to endorse me. Dave Smith's jerk of a daughter refused to betray him. I forgot the lie detector. I forgot hosting the debates and my announcement that I'd be running. I think I even forgot that I wore a different suit all 8 times I came on. If you want to watch the recap of the Skanks election, there's a 2 hour video about it here that I'll link to on the YouTube video of this podcast. I'll put a box link to it at the end of the video.</div> <div> </div> <div>Thank you to our sponsor: Dan Soder. Because of the generous contributions made by the Soder Superpac, I, Ari Shaffir, was able to win the most important election of our lifetime.
