  "description": "In the 1990s there was a massive flood of stand-up comedians making the leap to television to star in their own stand-up sitcoms thanks in part to the success of the Cosby Show and Roseanne.\n\nThose shows were followed by other massive hits like Seinfeld, Home Improvement, Martin, Ellen and The Drew Carey Show.   All of them featured a previously established stand-up comic who had been scouted from the comedy club circuit. \n\nBut there were lots of other shows starring comics that had high expectations but went down in flames like Grace Under Fire starring Bret Butler, All American Girl starring Margaret Cho and anything featuring Andrew Dice Clay.\n\nOn the next two episodes we are going to take a look back at some of the hits as well as some the failures from that decade.  On part one, we look back at the stories behind Roseanne, Seinfeld, Home Improvement, Martin and Ellen. \n\nContact:  \n\nTwitter: @1990shistory\n\nFacebook: @1990shistory\n\nInstagram: @that90spodcast\n\nEmail:  90s@curiouscast.ca\n\nGuests:\n\nPaul Brownfield, magazine writer, former TV critic at LA Times\n\nTwitter:  @paulbrownfield\n\nGreg David, TV critic and partner at www.TV-Eh.com\n\nTwitter:  @greg_david\nLearn more about your ad choices.
