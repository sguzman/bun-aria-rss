  "description": "<p>Scott Soshnick, Michael Barr and Eben Novy-Williams discuss a host of issues related to the business of sports, including the National Basketball Association's billion-dollar deal with Take-Two, securing the star power of LeBron James and others in the popular sports video game. The deal allows Take-Two's 2K studio to continue making its NBA 2K video game. Also discussed is Nike's new sneaker, unveiled earlier this week, that tracks performance in real time, allowing the company to give weekend warriors athletic tips and also sell them more products. The sneaker, which costs $350, needs regular charging and doesn't require tying of laces. In addition, discussed is John Skipper's task at DAZN, which the former ESPN president is trying to turn into the leader in direct-to-consumer sports. </p><p>Hosts: Scott Soshnick, Michael Barr and Eben Novy-Williams</p><p>Producer: Jessica Summers</p><p>Running time 14:42</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
