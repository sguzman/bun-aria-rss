  "description": "Charles Dawin’s 1859 book The Origin of Species introduced his famous theory of evolution. Darwin developed his theories of life and evolution after a historic voyage circumnavigating the globe on the H.M.S. Beagle. Most people at the time believed what the naturalist theologians believed: that God had created organisms perfectly adapted to their environments. Darwin, however, saw life in a different way. He saw organisms as constantly evolving to better fit their environments. Robert Proctor is a professor of History of Science and, by courtesy, Pulmonary Medicine at Stanford University. His work focuses on the history of scientific controversy. He has published works such as Packaged Pleasures: How Technology and Marketing Revolutionized Desire and is now working on a book titled Darwin in the History of Life.
