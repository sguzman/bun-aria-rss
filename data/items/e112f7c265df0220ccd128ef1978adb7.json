He's learned which luxury cars are cheap, what causes some weird Ferrari problems, how to protect you car, and has some funny stories about the early days.</p><p>In addition, Zack took his E46 drifting- finally- and saw some interesting match ups at the track, so we compare the drifting dynamics of an M3, a 240SX, and the other things we've slid.
