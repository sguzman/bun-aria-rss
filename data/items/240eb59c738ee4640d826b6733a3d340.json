  "description": "<p>We start the show off with a recap of the second half of our Carolina Roadtrip and then comes the Tower of London! In London, located on the north bank of the River Thames, stands a tower that the mere mention of the name inspires feelings of dread and the macabre and that is because this structure’s thousand-year-old history is full of imprisonment, torture and execution. Many famous names in history met their final demise at the Tower of London. The Great Tower was not always a prison. It served as a royal residence for a time and is officially known as Her Majesty’s Royal Palace and Fortress of the Tower of London. Control of this piece of property usually signified control of the country. Because so much mystery, intrigue and death is associated with the structure, it is reputed to be quite haunted. Our infamous Lady in White is only one of the many spooks people claim to have seen or felt. Join us as we explore the history and haunting of the Tower of London. The Moment in Oddity was suggested by Bob Sherfield and features painting with dead hands and This Day in History features the Soviet Union Launching Sputnik into Space. Our location was suggested by Bob Sherfield.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/10/hgb-ep-152-tower-of-london.html\"> http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2016/10/hgb-ep-152-tower-of-london.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p> </p>",
