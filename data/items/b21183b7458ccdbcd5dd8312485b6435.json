  "description": "<p dir=\"ltr\">This week on the Bear Grease Podcast, we’ve got the third and final episode in our series on the extraordinary life of the former slave, confederate soldier, bear hunter and Mississippi native, Holt Collier. Many believe he deserves to sit in the saddle with the greats of American history, but his life is stacked deep in controversy, murder, fortunes won and lost, and unrivaled adventure. We’ve tracked all the data points we have on Holt, but like boar bear pursued by hounds, he’s difficult to course. This episode is dedicated to his famous Teddy Bear Hunt where he guided president, Theodore Roosevelt, AND we’ll discuss Holt’s lasting legacy. He lived in bold opposition to the trends of the age – he was a black man that overcame, endured and thrived in the South in a dangerous period, but even in the midst of victory, his life leaves us with a tragic aftertaste. The story of Holt’s life exemplifies core Bear Grease, it’s the finest renderings, the choice meat of the akern, the flash of the flashiest mule, the crescendo trill of the barred owl, it’s the black panther of all black panther stories and I’m honored to tell it to you….I doubt you’re going to want to miss this one.</p>\n<p>Connect with <a href=\"https://www.themeateater.com/authors/claynewcomb\">Clay</a> and <a href=\"https://www.themeateater.com/\">MeatEater</a></p>\n<p>Clay on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/clay_newcomb\">Instagram</a></p>\n<p>MeatEater on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/meateater\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/StevenRinellaMeatEater/\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MeatEaterTV?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Twitter</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAaa0mleeU128Ad5iM1RFIg\">Youtube</a></p>\n<p>Shop <a href=\"https://store.themeateater.com/collections/bear-grease-podcast\">Bear Grease Merch</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
