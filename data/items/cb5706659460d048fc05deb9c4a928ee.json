  "title": "What were American troops doing in Niger?",
  "description": "Yochi, Zack, and special guest Loren DeJonge Schulman of the great podcast Bombshell talk about the deaths of four US soldiers in Niger in October, a tragedy at the center of a nasty political fight between President Trump and a grieving military widow. They discuss what those troops were doing there, why no one in the military seems to understand how the mission went so wrong, and how America’s military presence in Africa is quietly growing in both size and risk without public debate or much Congressional oversight -- a dynamic that means these won't be the last US troops to die fighting a shadow war in an African nation. On Elsewhere, we try something new — a dispatch from a wind farm in Puerto Rico that Yochi visited earlier this month while looking into the island's decimated power grid. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
