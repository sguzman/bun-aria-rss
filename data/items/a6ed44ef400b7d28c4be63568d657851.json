  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys welcome 2x Super Bowl Champion, 2018 Walter Payton Man of the Year, 2nd overall pick in the 2008 NFL Draft, Chris Long to chat about the NFL season being back officially with the Hall of Fame game, whether or not he ever played in the game, his thoughts on being a part of the media, what things that people in the media who never played bothers him, what training camp is like for defensive lineman in the NFL, fights in training camp, if he ever had to run laps or do push-ups during practice while in the NFL, and his thoughts on Aaron Rodgers coming back to Green Bay (2:20-39:56). Later, Pat and AJ chat more about everything going on in the sports world including Lionel Messi leaving Barcelona, potentially coming to the US to play in the MLS, the Hall of Fame game tonight, and why stats from training camp are the most misleading things ever, and that we should just be happy that we officially have football back (47:50-1:51:12).
