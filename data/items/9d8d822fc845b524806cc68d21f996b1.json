  "description": "<p>For this episode I interview Dr. R. Wolf Shipon, psychologist and author of “One Minute Healing.” We discuss gratitude, how psychology has blended with acupuncture, the techniques he uses to treat patients with the fear of public speaking and other phobias and how our past doesn’t have to predict our future. Wolf is one of the most positive and delightful people I know and I hope you’ll enjoy his company as much as I did. Learn more about Wolf’s practice in Mountain Lakes, NJ at inner-wellth.com. <br/><br/>I’m also delighted to share that I’ve just published my first children’s book, entitled “There’s Always Hope,” which teaches about the joy of life even if things don’t go exactly as planned (you may find it on Amazon.com). Sydney’s story will touch the hearts of both children and adults as they read about how she overcomes an obstacle she didn’t expect. “There’s Always Hope” is beautifully illustrated by Briana Giasullo. I wrote “There’s Always Hope” with love for children ages nine and under or to serve as a symbolic gift for any adult who needs encouragement. <br/><br/>Please leave a rating of this episode on iTunes!  <br/><br/>How to leave a rating on iTunes:</p><p>1) Launch Apple’s purple Podcast app in your phone<br/>2) <em>Even if you already subscribe to / have Psychology America and it is open</em>, tap “Search”<br/>3) Enter “Psychology America with Dr. Alexandra” <br/>4) Tap on the photo of the podcast<br/>5) Scroll all the way down<br/>6) Press the star rating you choose and/or tap the “write a review.”  For the highest rating tap the last star on the right first.  </p><p>Your review is appreciated!</p><a rel=\"payment\" href=\"https://www.buymeacoffee.com/dralexandra\">Support the show</a><p>This show was created with love on my volunteer time.
