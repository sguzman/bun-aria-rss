  "description": "Will Brinson is joined by Jonathan Jones to offer their prevailing thoughts on the free agency period. The Bucs and Patriots will be inextricably tied for the foreseeable future due to Tom Brady's decision last season and subsequent Super Bowl win. But who had the better free agency in 2021 (2:15)? Tampa focused on retaining their title team while New England spent like they never have before. Brinson and JJ also discuss the Giants' spending (11:00) and the lack of quarterback movement that we were promised (17:45). We have to address the latest allegations against Deshaun Watson and what that could mean for any potential trade. Lastly, the guys touch on the NFL's new TV rights deal and how that will impact the league moving forward (29:00). \n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nYou can listen to Pick Six on your smart speakers!
