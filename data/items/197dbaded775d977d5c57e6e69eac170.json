  "description": "<p>with Marc Andreessen (@pmarca), Ben Horowitz (@bhorowitz), and Stewart Butterfield (@stewart)</p>\n<p>A lot in technology -- and venture -- happens in decades. New cycles of technology come and go, including some secular shifts; a new generation of founders matures; and so much more changes. So when Andreessen Horowitz (dubbed with the numeronym \"a16z\") was founded a decade ago as of this month, the tech landscape looked very different between then and now: Not only had the global economy just seen a recession, but trends like mobile and cloud and even social were just taking off.</p>\n<p>Now, 10 years later, what's changed -- not just in tech, but in profiles of entrepreneurs? And what's changed in the firm itself, given that Marc and Ben -- the Andreessen and the Horowitz -- were yet again entrepreneurs in founding the firm too? As another repeat entrepreneur from then to now, guest host Stewart Butterfield, CEO of Slack, interviews the a16z co-founders in this special episode of the a16z Podcast to commemorate our 10th anniversary.</p>\n<hr />\n<p>The views expressed here are those of the individual AH Capital Management, L.L.C.
