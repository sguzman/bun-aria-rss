  "itunes:summary": "Sometimes the best way to tell a story about something vast and far reaching is to focus instead on the microcosm. And so it goes with Erik Larson’s \"In the Garden of Beasts: Love, Terror, and an American Family in Hitler's Berlin.\" A book of nonfiction that resembles good fiction, Larson’s latest work looks at Berlin in the 1930s and explores why the world didn’t recognize the Nazi threat until too late.",
