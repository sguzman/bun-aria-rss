  "description": "<p>Monocular 3D reconstruction is to reconstruct the shape of object and its\nother information from a single RGB image. In 3D reconstruction, polygon mesh,\nwith detailed surface information and low computational cost, is the most\nprevalent expression form obtained from deep learning models. However, the\nstate-of-the-art schemes fail to directly generate well-structured meshes, and\nmost of meshes have two severe problems Vertices Clustering (VC) and Illegal\nTwist (IT). By diving into the mesh deformation process, we pinpoint that the\ninappropriate usage of Chamfer Distance (CD) loss is the root causes of VC and\nIT problems in the training of deep learning model. In this paper, we initially\ndemonstrate these two problems induced by CD loss with visual examples and\nquantitative analyses. Then, we propose a fine-grained reconstruction method\nCD$^2$ by employing Chamfer distance twice to perform a plausible and adaptive\ndeformation. Extensive experiments on two 3D datasets and comparisons with five\nlatest schemes demonstrate that our CD$^2$ directly generates well-structured\nmeshes and outperforms others by alleviating VC and IT problems.\n</p>",
