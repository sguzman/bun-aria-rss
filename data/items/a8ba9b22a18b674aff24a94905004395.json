  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, the fatal shooting in Minnesota was a horrific tragedy. The incident was caught on tape and is nothing like the George Floyd case. It clearly had nothing to do with systemic racism and the looters should be jailed accordingly. The mayor has fired the City Manager, Curt Boganey, for asking for due process. The media have already drawn their conclusions and done away with any form of due process.  When the Mayor fired Boganey he became part of the mob. Then, Tucker Carlson has been attacked by the Anti-Defamation League (ADL) for making 'White supremacist' comments. Yet, the truth is that Carlson's comments were based on the facts of what's happening at the border to change the voting demography of southern states. The ADL is led by a secular Jew and former Obama White House staffer that seemingly agreed with President Obama's anti-Semitic views. The ADL should fire their CEO, Jonathan Greenblatt! Later, Joe Biden is ramming through trillions of dollars that ultimately benefit his base, not the people. Everything is being done in the name of infrastructure even if it isn't. Congressional Republicans should reject any deals with the Democrats and play offense. Meanwhile, Democrats are seizing on the fecklessness of the GOP and working with large corporations to implement their leftist vision for voting laws.  \n\n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
