  "description": "<div>In today’s episode, Lisa, Jamie, and Mikey are taste testing healthy food finds like chicken meatballs, Hawaiian-style chicken, yummy veggie bites, an on-the-go smoothie, and SO MUCH MORE! Plus, an overnight oats find that might be the best one Lisa has ever tried, and steamed dumplings that are better than what you’ll get at a Chinese restaurant! We don’t mean to rush you, but you have to push play right now!!! Then when you’re done, head on over to our <a href=\"https://www.hungry-girl.com/pages/costco-haul-fall-20-episode\">Foodcast page</a> for a list of all the products mentioned in the episode!</div>\n",
