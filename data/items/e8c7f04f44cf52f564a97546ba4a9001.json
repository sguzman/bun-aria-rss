  "description": "<p>Chad Daybell's trial for multiple counts of first-degree murder is set to begin just after the new year. The Idaho man is accused of killing his wife, Tammy Daybell and the children of the woman he marries just two weeks after Tammy died. JJ and Tylee Vallow are missing for months before their bodies are found on Daybell's property. At first, Tammy Daybell's death is ruled natural cases. The seemingly healthy 49-year-old is training to run a 4K race, but Chad Daybell reports that his wife is dead in the bed beside him one morning. The coroner does not attend the scene, only officers who say the death appears to be natural. What's more, an autopsy is refused by the family.  As bodies seem to pile up around the newlywed family, questions are raised. Other deaths connected to this investigation include Lori Vallow Daybell's ex-husbands, and her brother. Today on Body Bags, forensic expert and former death scene investigator Joseph Scott Morgan looks into the unexplained death of Tammy Daybell. </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
