The show finishes up being joined by Dallas Cowboys DT Osa Odighizuwa and he talks about his activity on Twitter and then makes a pitch to the fans on why the Cowboys will be good this year.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
