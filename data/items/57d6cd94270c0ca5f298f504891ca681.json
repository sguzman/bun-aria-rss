  "description": "Greg Jenner is joined by comedian Elis James and historian Dr Kathryn Hurlock to explore the life and political career of medieval Welsh rebel Owain Glyndŵr, the last Welsh-born Prince of Wales, who led an uprising against English rule. It’s an extraordinary tale of war, vengeance, poetry, annoying next-door neighbours, top-notch gardens and probably a lot of damp and drizzly battlefield action (and inaction). Plus Greg squeezes in an obligatory Tottenham Hotspur reference.\n\nResearch: Kierri Price\nScript: Emma Nagouse, Kierri Price and Greg Jenner\nProject manager: Siefe Miyo\nEdit producer: Cornelius Mendez",
