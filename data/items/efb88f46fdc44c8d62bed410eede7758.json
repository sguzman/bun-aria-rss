Cellars, for four vintages (2007-2010) and honed the craft of winemaking through hands on experience and a passion for reading and learning from his Dad, other winemakers, books, UC Davis, the internet, and his own mistakes. Eventually, he abandoned his plans for graduate school and further dedicated himself to the craft of winemaking. Lucas took over daily operation of the winery in 2010, and after four years as Co-Winemaker with Charlie, officially became <a href=\"http://meekerwine.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Head Winemaker in 2014</a>.</p> <p>Here are the show notes:</p> <ul> <li>We chat about the storied history of Meeker, including Charlie's stories from MGM, how he bought the vineyard and how he uprooted Lucas from his Hollywood life to Sonoma</li> <li>We discuss various aspects of the wine industry -- what Custom Crush is and why it's important to wineries like Meeker, the importance of label reading and why some wineries are a sham</li> <li>We wax poetic on the virtue of Merlot and Lucas gives thoughts on wine traditions and their importance</li> <li>Lucas talks about the \"magnitude\" of wine  and how he parses wine descriptions</li> <li>We talk about Zinfandel and changes in the wine industry in the last 10 years -- including how wine can be altered or honest</li> <li>We have a great conversation about the <a href= \"http://meekerwine.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Meeker</a> philosophy and Lucas's \"end zone\"</li> <li>We end on a positive note: Lucas's optimism for the next gen of winemakers</li> </ul> <p> </p> <p>____________________________</p> <p> </p> <p>Please support this week's sponsor, <a href= \"https://www.rxbar.com/wine\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">RXBAR</a> by ordering their tasty products and receiving 25% off!
