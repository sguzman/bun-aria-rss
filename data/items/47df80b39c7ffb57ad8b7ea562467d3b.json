  "description": "<p>On this episode of Battles & Banter, Avery returns to the Western Front of WWI with recurring regular Justin Voithofer and historian/author Ryan Quint to discuss the vicious fighting and legacy of Belleau Wood, the battle that earned fame for the United States Marine Corps in June 1918. Today, Belleau Wood is the location of the Aisne-Marne American Cemetery and the resting place of nearly 2,300 Americans who gave their lives for their country, and ultimately other countries as well. Avery, Ryan & Justin highlight the significance of the battle, and why people should care about it today outside of the Marine Corps', who have immortalized it as beginning of the USMC as we know it today. Unfortunately, ignorance is prevalent right now in the U.S., and we here at Battles & Banter want to make it clear that men who gave the last full measure of devotion at Belleau Wood ARE NOT LOSERS. So if you have never heard of Belleau Wood and want to know more, this episode is a good place to start. Enjoy.</p>",
