  "description": "This week on Milk Street Radio, we speak with Andy Ricker (Pok Pok) in Chiang Mai, Thailand. “Western food … builds flavor over time to come up with a monolithic, single, strong, rich flavor,” Ricker says. “Thai food and southeast Asian food, in general, tends to be this battle of different bright, salty, sweet, sour, hot, bitter (notes), all working together in various different roles in particular dishes. But they don’t meld to become one thing. Often (with) dishes here, you can taste everything that’s going on, all at once in a bite.” Also on today’s show, Dan Pashman of The Sporkful makes New Year’s resolutions, Adam Gopnik explores eating in difficult political times, and we present our quick sizzling greens recipe. Finally, Christopher Kimball and Sara Moulton take your calls.<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
