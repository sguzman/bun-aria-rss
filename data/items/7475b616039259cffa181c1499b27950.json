  "description": "You think the market will be fine if Hillary wins the election... think again! Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged. Today I'm joined by the No. 1 credit strategist in the world, Michael Lewitt. Michael is the editor of the Money Map Press investment advisory, Zenith Trading Circle. Michael starts off the interview by telling us why we are in a political crisis. With the election just one week away, Michael explains how the market has been in a completely \"un-parallel\" universe...  breaking down why investors have been fooling themselves this whole time. Then, giving us numbers no one else is talking about, Michael dives into the policies surrounding corporate America. This is capitalism upside-down. Michael shows us how companies are disguising investors everyday. Tune-in as he names a few over-looked sectors facing dangerous headwinds going forward. You see, Michael is not your average analyst. He is a best-selling author and has decades of experience focusing on the economy's unstable environment.
