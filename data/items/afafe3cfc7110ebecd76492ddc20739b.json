  "description": "<p>In a recent editorial, David French asked whether the primary threat to the church comes from within or without? Phil, Skye, and Kaitlyn discuss the question and whether the church is primarily for or against the world. Plus, why are so many Christian ministries focused on protecting kids? Is it related to our fixation on the danger of hell? Then, Skye talks with A.J. Swoboda about his new book “After Doubt: How to Question Your Faith without Losing it.” He says a lot of people aren’t really deconstructing Christianity, but a false form of the faith that should be abandoned. And Swoboda explains the danger of a culture in which everything new is seen as superior. Also this week—the Colorado baker refuses to make a transgender cake, coyote pups, and screaming foxes.</p> <p><a class=\"c-link\" href= \"https://www.denverpost.com/2021/03/23/colorado-baker-lawsuit-gender-transition-birthday-cake/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link= \"https://www.denverpost.com/2021/03/23/colorado-baker-lawsuit-gender-transition-birthday-cake/\" data-sk= \"tooltip_parent\">https://www.denverpost.com/2021/03/23/colorado-baker-lawsuit-gender-transition-birthday-cake/</a></p> <p><a class=\"c-link\" href= \"https://frenchpress.thedispatch.com/p/the-question-that-dictates-how-christians\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link= \"https://frenchpress.thedispatch.com/p/the-question-that-dictates-how-christians\" data-sk= \"tooltip_parent\">https://frenchpress.thedispatch.com/p/the-question-that-dictates-how-christians</a></p> <p><a class=\"c-link\" href= \"https://dandarling.substack.com/p/in-here-out-there-on-assessing-spiritual\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link= \"https://dandarling.substack.com/p/in-here-out-there-on-assessing-spiritual\" data-sk= \"tooltip_parent\">https://dandarling.substack.com/p/in-here-out-there-on-assessing-spiritual</a></p> <p><a class=\"c-link\" href= \"https://www.amazon.com/People-Truth-Worshipping-Community-Modern/dp/1579105602\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link= \"https://www.amazon.com/People-Truth-Worshipping-Community-Modern/dp/1579105602\" data-sk= \"tooltip_parent\">https://www.amazon.com/People-Truth-Worshipping-Community-Modern/dp/1579105602</a></p> <p><a class=\"c-link\" href= \"https://www.amazon.com/After-Doubt-Question-without-Losing/dp/1587434512\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link= \"https://www.amazon.com/After-Doubt-Question-without-Losing/dp/1587434512\" data-sk= \"tooltip_parent\">https://www.amazon.com/After-Doubt-Question-without-Losing/dp/1587434512</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.patreon.com/posts/50587974\">https://www.patreon.com/posts/50587974</a></p>",
