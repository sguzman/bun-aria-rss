  "description": "<p>On today's ZBT we've got 5 Rounds in the magazine...\n\nRound 1: A fella on TikTok made a frog army that turned into a case of good initiative, bad judgement. The result of his TikTok could be a mass extinction of up to 90 different types of frogs.\n\nRound 2: Military members are known to have many tattoos, sometimes they look great, sometimes they look like Chaps'. Either way, one service allows you to keep all of them.\n\nRound 3: Nearly 60,000 Guard and reserve troops are on the verge of being kicked out after refusing the COVID vaccine. Is that a good or bad thing considering the current problems in recruiting?\n\nRound 4: It seems like our NAVY should be advanced enough for an F-18 not to fall off an aircraft carrier because of some high wind. \n\nRound 5: A Brazilian model was forced into a wheelchair after politely holding in her gas for so long.\n\nBonus Round: Will It Suck? Previewing Biden's next announcement.\n\nSUPPORT THE SHOW!!!\n\nWhistlePig Whiskey\n-Get your bottle at https://barstool.link/WPZBT or at a local retailer. \n\nCheck out Barstool Sports for more: http://www.barstoolsports.com\n\nFollow Zero Blog Thirty here:\nFacebook: https://facebook.com/zeroblog30/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/zeroblog30\nInstagram: http://instagram.com/zeroblog30</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
