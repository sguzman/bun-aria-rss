    "media:description": "I did it, I actually watched James Corden in Camila Cabello in Cinderella 2021.\n\nBig thanks to Noble Lucy for watching Cinderella 2021 with me.\n\nIt was painful to watch, twice... Had to remake the video nearly 3 times. The last video I did called \"How James Corden Went From \"Lovable Brit\" to Intolerable Brat...\" became a massive hit on this channel. I went into detail about James Corden became a bit of a brat.\n\nBut I did say in that video that I'd watch this film if that video got over 500 likes. Safe to say that goal was achieved.",
