  "description": "<p>In this 145th in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens.<br/><br/>This week, we begin by discussing the interview between Jon Stewart and the Attorney General of Arkansas. Yes, protecting children does mean overriding the recommendations of several prominent organizations, including the American Medical Association (AMA), and the Endocrine Society, both of which we discuss as well. The President of the AMA says he’s working hard against medical disinformation, in part by participating in a “Festival of Fact-Checking” sponsored by self-appointed fact-checking organizations, and featuring science himself, Anthony Fauci. Then, with help from Barbara Ehrenreich’s excellent book on the topic, we discuss actual festivals, and the human history of ecstatic ritual, and ask whether an increase in depression coincided in human history with a decline in festivals. Finally, we discuss the virtues of driving around with your windows open.<br/><br/>*****<br/><br/>Our sponsors:<br/><br/>ReliefBand: Get relief from nausea without drugs.
