  "description": "<p>The first day of competition at Tokyo 2020 is finally upon us which means we're back to go over all the excitement and action that it brought us! How disappointed are we all that there were no medals for either Canada or Australia on the first day? How can we use our commentary skills to perfection when it comes to the great sport of dressage? Did the road race go on maybe for a bit too long? How do we feel about the two epic Canada v Australia battle royals that happened today? Is Canada finishing 5th in the road race basically a gold medal win for them? Why was the weightlifting and the fencing maybe the best things to watch today? And just what type of kid talk do we need to work on when it comes to describing one of the new Olympic sports? Get yourself clicking and into the know once more as we wrap up day 1 of Tokyo in style! </p>",
