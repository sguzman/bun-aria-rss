He also reveals how he would've handled the Hunter Biden email story if he were the editor of the New York Post, gives his predictions for the final debate (if it even happens), and imagines what Donald Trump will do if he doesn't win a second term. \"He ain't gonna get down to Dallas and paint,\" O'Reilly says. \"He'll probably buy the L.A. Lakers and fire LeBron James!\"\n\nThis Week’s Sponsor:\n\nLosing your hair is no fun. KEEPS offers the same doctor-recommended, FDA-approved hair loss treatment – but for about half the cost!
