  "description": "<p>The hero bell and the garbage bell both got a workout with this one...</p>\n\n\n<p>\"How To Survive A Plague\" is a riveting, powerful telling of the story of the grassroots movement of activists, many of them in a life-or-death struggle, who seized upon scientific research to help develop the drugs that turned HIV from a mostly fatal infection to a manageable disease. Ignored by public officials, religious leaders, and the nation at large, and confronted with shame and hatred, this small group of men and women chose to fight for their right to live by educating themselves and demanding to become full partners in the race for effective treatments. Around the globe, 16 million people are alive today thanks to their efforts.</p>\n\n\n<p>Be sure to check out the <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/TrueCrimeObsessed\">hilarious bonus content</a> we're creating via <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/TrueCrimeObsessed\">Patreon</a>!
