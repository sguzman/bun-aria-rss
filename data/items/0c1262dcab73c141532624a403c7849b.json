  "description": "<p>On today’s show, Pat and the guys sit down and chat about how awesome everything involved with the College Gameday process was, what some of his favorite moments were, what Coach Corso is like, how insane the crowd was in Brookings, South Dakota, and what it was like being apart of one of the longest running and most successful shows of all time. The guys also discuss everything that happened in this weekend’s NFL games including how good Aaron Rodgers and the Packers are after squeezing out a win at Arrowhead on Sunday night, why the Colts are still Super Bowl bound in Pat’s eyes, and how their win this weekend, albeit not pretty, was incredibly impressive. The guys also break down how the only obstacle in the AFC for the Colts is the Patriots, and how impressive they have been, including this weekend’s dominating win over the Browns. The guys also dive into the Mitch Trubisky situation in Chicago, and whether or not Buffalo is for real. Also joining the show is the GOAT of all GOATS, friend of the program, 4X Super Bowl Champion, and the NFL all-time points leader, Adam Vinatieri, joins the show. He and Pat talk about his game on Sunday and how he was relishing an opportunity to have a game winning kick, why he thinks this years Colts team is a little different, how impressed he’s been with Jacoby Brissett and why everyone in that locker room isn’t shocked by how successful he’s been, Bill Belichick earning win 300, and his thoughts on where this Colts team can go (1:05:32-1:22:26). Today’s episode is a fun one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
