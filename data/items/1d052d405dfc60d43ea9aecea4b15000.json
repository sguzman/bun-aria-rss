  "description": "<p>The Cachtice Castle was once home to Baroness Elizabeth Bathory. She came from a family known for their cruelty to the peasontry and she possibly witnessed incredible violence from the time she was a child. Is this what led her to be called the \"Blood Countess?\" Was she truly the most prolific female serial killer of all time? Or was she given a bad rap, so that others could have her power and possessions? The Castle is a magnificient structure that may house the energy of intense emotions and pain. Has the energy led this structure to become haunted? Does Madame Bathory still walk its halls? Come with us as we look at the history and hauntings of Cachtice Castle and Madame Bathory. Moment in Oddity features a French Calvary capturing a Dutch fleet and This Day in History features the birth of Alfred Nobel. We also included what appears to be nearly a Class A EVP from our visit to the St. Augustine Lighthouse that listener Shawn heard while listening to Episode 76.</p> <p>Check out the website:  <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p>",
