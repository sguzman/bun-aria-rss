  "description": "In the novel <em>Agatha Of Little Neon</em>, a young woman, Agatha, is in need of direction after she loses her mother and finds it in the church. When Agatha and her fellow nuns are reassigned to a half-way house, they start to look inward and reevaluate their own lives. Author Claire Luchette told NPR's Scott Simon that this is a book about finding yourself, but also finding out about the darker side of the church: \"My goal in writing this book was not to write a loss-of-faith story but almost a falling-out-of-love story.\"",
