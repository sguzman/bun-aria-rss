  "description": "<p><em>This season, </em>More Perfect<em> is taking its camera lens off the Supreme Court and zooming in on the words of the people: the 27 amendments that We The People have made to our Constitution. We're taking on these 27 amendments both in song and in story. This episode is best listened to alongside <a href=\"https://project.wnyc.org/themostperfectalbum/\" target=\"_blank\">27: The Most Perfect Album</a></em><em>, an entire album (an ALBUM!) and digital experience of original music and art inspired by the 27 Amendments. Think of these episodes as the audio liner notes.</em></p>\n<p>The <strong>Fourth, Fifth, Sixth, Seventh and Eighth Amendments</strong> enshrine some of our most important civil liberties. They tell us about the rights we have when the government knocks on our door, including protections from \"unreasonable searches and seizures,\" self-incrimination, \"cruel and unusual punishments,\" and the right to \"a speedy and public trial\"-- among others.</p>\n<p>Episode Two looks at these amendments through the story of one man, Christopher Scott, who finds himself face-to-face with Dallas police officers as they investigate a violent crime. The role that these amendments play—and fail to play— in Christopher’s encounter tells a profound story about the presence of the Constitution in our everyday lives.</p>\n<p>And when you're done with the episode, <a href=\"https://project.wnyc.org/themostperfectalbum/\" target=\"_blank\">listen</a> to the songs by Briana Marela, Torres, Sons of an Illustrious Father, Adia Victoria, Nana Grizol, and High Waisted inspired by Amendments 4, 5, 6, 7 and 8 on<em> <a href=\"https://project.wnyc.org/themostperfectalbum/\" target=\"_blank\">27: The Most Perfect Album</a>.</em></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><em>Special thanks to Gloria Browne-Marshall and David Gray.</em></p>",
