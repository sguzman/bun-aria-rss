But the judge has instructed their lawyers that biological boys must be referred to as “female” in his courtroom. We’ll discuss that insanity. And in our Daily Cancellation, I’ll cancel a NYT writer who thinks mothers should be getting paid to be mothers.\n\nIf you like The Matt Walsh Show, become a member TODAY with promo code: WALSH and enjoy the exclusive benefits for 10% off at https://www.dailywire.com/Walsh\nLearn more about your ad choices.
