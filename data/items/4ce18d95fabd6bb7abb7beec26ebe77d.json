  "description": "<p><strong>Stephane Silverman</strong> literally grew up in the fabric business—his parents brought the French textile company Boussac to America, and as a child, he would do his homework in their D&D Building showroom. A restless intellect and a critical thinker, Silverman has been experimenting with ways to modernize a distinctly old-school industry ever since he started Castel in 1999. In this episode of the <i>Business of Home</i> podcast, he gives host <strong>Dennis Scully</strong> a whirlwind tour through the past, present and future of fabric, explaining why the Amazon version of e-commerce doesn’t work for interior design, the future of showrooms, and the surprising reason why a yard of fabric costs what it does.  <i>This episode is sponsored by Henrybuilt and Industry West.</i></p>\n",
