  "description": "<p>We’re seeing one of the hottest housing markets in recent history! Bidding wars are driving up prices, homes are going under contract after just one week on the market, and mortgage rates are near historic lows. But that raises the question- is it a dumb idea to buy a home with these kinds of conditions and with the market this hot? What if this is another housing bubble? Are we going to see prices come crashing down like they did just over 12 year ago? We share our thoughts as we discuss a bunch of different reasons for residential real estate being on fire. And if you <em>are</em> ready to buy a home, we also cover a number of different tactics that you should implement to ensure that you get the home you want without overpaying.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Rhyming Numbers- thanks to Eighth State Brewing for donating this one to the show!
