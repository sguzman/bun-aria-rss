And there are many moving pieces that we can tap into to feel empowered in our own wellness journey. Functional Medicine looks at the body with a systems-based approach, understanding how all our different parts work together and looking at a symptom as a sign of dysfunction that we need to get to the root cause of, not just tame.&nbsp;</p><br><p>I sat down with Dr. Elizabeth Boham to discuss what it means to get to the root cause of disease and how the principles we practice do exactly that.
