  "description": "In 2021, Apple launched iCloud Private Relay, a new service designed to protect users? privacy on the internet. Akamai was very excited to be a part of delivering this service, and through a series of separate linked blog posts, we will explain how the service works and what Akamai customers can do to ensure the best possible experience for iCloud Private Relay end users. In this post, I?d like to provide a high-level overview of the project as well as a discussion of what this means for Akamai customers.",
