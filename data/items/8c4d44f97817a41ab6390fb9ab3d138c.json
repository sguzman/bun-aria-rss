  "description": "<div>Sophia Temperilli grew up and lived in an actively haunted house for much of her formative childhood years. A home that was not haunted by a friendly or pleasant spirit, but rather, something that certainly had ill and dark intent. This would lead her on a life quest to find answers as to who, what, and why the dead seem to surround the living.  She started investigating the paranormal at the age of 8 years old. And started her own broadcast about the paranormal at 12 years old. The paranormal and supernatural are truly an ingrained element of her life. This is her story, today, on The Grave Talks.<br>\n<br>\n<strong>In Part 2, EXCLUSIVE TO GRAVE KEEPERS!  Listen Here!  </strong><a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/thegravetalks\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/thegravetalks\">http://www.patreon.com/thegravetalks</a></strong></a><strong><br>\n<br>\n</strong>Has Sophia ever had any suspicions that there was something paranormal in her new house?<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>How did Sophia begin broadcasting about the paranormal at the age of 12?<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>What are some of the most surprising things Sophia has learned in her years of broadcasting?<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>What is it about the Queen Mary that makes it such a haunted location? <br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>\n<strong><br>\nPlease support us on Patreon and get access to our AD-FREE ARCHIVE, ADVANCE EPISODES & MORE at </strong><a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/thegravetalks\"><strong><a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/thegravetalks\">http://www.patreon.com/thegravetalks</a></strong></a>\n</div>\n",
