  "description": "<p>It's October, which is almost Halloween, and that means it's basically Christmas - and we are cruising through our Taylor discography! We're talking about Speak Now, Taylor's 3rd album and one she wrote entirely by herself. We all know Taylor is in the middle of re-recording her albums and releasing them in their original intended glory (RED is dropping in November) but for some reason, Speak Now is getting skipped over. (1989 will be next). However, this album was one of her most pivotal and one that meant something different to each one of us. Listen along as we discuss the album notes, songs (and words) to live by, and why Speak Now is an album that will forever go down as our favorite.</p>",
