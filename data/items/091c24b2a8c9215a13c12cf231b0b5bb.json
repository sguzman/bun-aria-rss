  "description": "It’s not ground breaking news that the world around you is super loud. Hearing your own thoughts and recognizing your own inner voice is near impossible if you don’t have a regular practice in place. With the right tools, the right resources and the right mindset you can turn down the external noise and increase your self-awareness.<br /><br />Jay Shetty, former monk, best-selling author and podcast host, recommends that you start by changing your circle of people and refining your ‘why’. Having lived the life of a monk there are experiences and resources Jay shares that are super simple but serious work to implement. <br /><br />Turning inward to become more self-aware and begin to develop the mental muscle you need to start forming your passion, your meaning and your purpose is a lot of work well worth the effort. Whether your passion is developed through pain or compassion, this episode is your sign to do the internal work needed to quiet society and chaos and learn from your  higher self.<br /><br />“I am not what I think I am, and I am not what you think I am.
