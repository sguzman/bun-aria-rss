  "description": "<p>Siobhan has done it all. As a senior civil servant she advised both the new Labour and coalition governments before leaving to stand for office herself. In 2012 she ran for London Mayor as an independent and finished just behind the Lib Dems. It was an incredible achievement and underlined her appeal as a charismatic and impressive politician. In this fascinating interview she describes the elation and frustration of that campaign and the way independent candidates are locked out of key parts of the process. Siobhan was going to stand for the mayoralty again in 2021 and was the Lib Dem candidate until she stood down and eventually left the party. She explains how she came to that decision and why she and so many others still feel so frustrated with the state of British politics.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Follow Siobhan on Twitter: @SiobhanBenita</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Buy tickets to The Political Party, live at The Duchess Theatre including the opening night with&nbsp;<strong>Andy Burnham on Monday 27 September</strong>&nbsp;here:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.nimaxtheatres.com/shows/the-political-party-with-matt-forde/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.nimaxtheatres.com/shows/the-political-party-with-matt-forde/</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Email the show: <a href=\"mailto:politicalpartypodcast@gmail.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">politicalpartypodcast@gmail.com</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Follow Matt on Twitter: @mattforde</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Follow Matt on WTSocial:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://wt.social/u/matt-forde\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://wt.social/u/matt-forde</a></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
