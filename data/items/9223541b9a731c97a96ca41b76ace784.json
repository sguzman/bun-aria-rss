  "description": "This is something that seems so normal in our lives as we are constantly interviewing our clientele to learn about the way the rhythm of their life goes and then design after that rhythm. We’ve had a client who had their kitchen done and everything was designed and organized according to how she operates in her kitchen, not only making everything look really nice, but it was all very neat and convenient as well. A great way to go about organizing and breaking down your space is by dividing it up into zones according to what you do, such as a place for tea, or a bar, or a place for soft drinks, whatever your ritual may be. We also did a kitchen where we put a little fridge drawer on the other side of the island in order to prevent kids from accessing the main refrigerator and getting in the way of mom while she’s preparing a meal. <br /><br />Recycling and waste 3:48<br />Kitchen example 6:27<br />Tiger Oak example 10:11<br />Kitchens and functionality 15:07<br />Kids kitchen functionality 17:32<br />The party pantry 21:08<br /><br />“As we’ve been doing home offices like this past year, I found it really lovely to kind of place a nearby ottoman nested underneath the desks, so that whoever the client is, they can put their feet up on there, but then the ottoman can also be used for the nearby pair of chairs, you know, that are in the corner of the room.” 19:43<br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelaneinteriors/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://alicelanehome.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://alicelanehome.com/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/AliceLaneHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.pinterest.com/alicelanehome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/alicelanehomecollectionsaltlakecity</a><br />News Letter:<br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a>",
