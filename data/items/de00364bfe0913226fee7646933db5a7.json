  "description": "<p>On Day 8 of the 12 Days of Culture, Matt & Bow discuss a whole host of what-not-to-do's, such as attending large sex parties during a pandemic, attempting to organize a large sex party during the pandemic via subtweets on Twitter, and invading someone's space during an awards show! While discussing Diana Ross's well-meaning yet infamous boob-jiggle of Lil Kim way back in the late 90's, our hosts also delve into other problematic instances of awards show onstage indiscretion, such as the famous Halle Berry-Adrien Brody of it all, and the less famous (but pretty jarring) Jim Carrey-Alicia Silverstone *moment*. If you don't know, you <em>will</em> know. Also, some re-litigation of Day 7 of the 12 Days of Culture, and how we must honor the music of the pandemic in the Great After, whenever that comes. We're looking at you, Ms. Lipa!
