[49:23]   QUOTES: “If you grow up in an extremely wealthy family, if your father is worth $10-billion dollars, you might not have the drive to do the kind of things you need to do to win a Nobel Prize or a Pulitzer Prize or something else. If you grow up in a modest family, you know if you’re going to get anywhere in life, you’ve got to do it on your own.” [6:33]   “You can’t be insecure. If you’re insecure, you surround yourself with people that are not that good, and great people surround themselves with people that are smarter than them.” [36:54]   “…you have to have a vision of where you want to go, you have to persist in it, you have to be willing to overcome failures, and not be afraid of making a mistake.” [49:16]   FOLLOW DAVID: Website: davidrubenstein.com",
