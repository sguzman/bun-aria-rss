  "description": "It's Mount Rushmore, with a twist. Over the past two weeks, CBSSports.com has been unveiling 'Franchise Fives', highlighting the top members in the history of each NFL team. This week, it's a focus on the AFC. Will Brinson, Ryan Wilson and Sean Wagner-McGough each narrow in on their most interesting 'Franchise Five' in the conference, breaking down no-brainer picks, some questionable decisions and snubs. They discuss the Steelers (5:00), Chargers (14:30) and Texans (21:30). Then, John Breech hops on and welcomes special guest aka his dad, Jim Breech, to break down the Bengals 'Franchise Five' (41:30). Jim was Cincinnati's longtime kicker.\n*Note: The Breeches recorded their portion of the podcast on Friday. On Sunday, one of the players they mentioned, Ken Riley, passed away at the age of 72. We send our condolences to the Riley family.\n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nFollow the Pick Six team on Twitter: @picksixpod, @willbrinson, @ryanwilsonCBS @johnbreech, @seanjwagner\nCheck out the Pick Six Instagram page https://www.instagram.com/picksixpod/?hl=en\nJoin our Facebook group https://www.facebook.com/groups/758548147935545/\nFor more NFL coverage from CBS Sports, visit https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/\nTo hear more from the CBS Sports Podcast Network, visit https://www.cbssports.com/podcasts/\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
