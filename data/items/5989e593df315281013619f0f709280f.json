  "title": "Process & Inspiration with David Mankin [128]",
  "description": "<p>In this episode, Louise chats with Cornish painter David Mankin about his new book Remembering in Paint. The book brings the reader inside Mankin's process, from initial inspiration all the way through to finished paintings, and the idea of the artistic process is central to the book. We begin the conversation with an introduction to David's career and the importance of chance encounters, and then move on to delve into process. David poses a question he believes every artist must answer; describes the importance of his process to his work; explains the balance of thought vs. feeling in his paintings; and shares his passion for the Cornish coast. Finally, we learn why he is currently excited about cauliflowers and smiles. This is a conversation not to be missed with an artist who is most definitely on the rise.</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p>David's book can be pre-ordered on his website at <a href=\"https://www.david-mankin.com/book \">https://www.david-mankin.com/book&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p>You can also find him at <a href=\"https://linktr.ee/davidmankinart \">https://linktr.ee/davidmankinart&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p>Louise's book Life Force can be pre-ordered at:<a href=\"//\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/book \">https://www.louisefletcherart.com/book&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p>All About Process by Kim Grant<a href=\" https://blackwells.co.uk/bookshop/product/9780271077451?\"> https://blackwells.co.uk/bookshop/product/9780271077451?</a></p>\n<p>Find our websites and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/\">www.alicesheridan.com&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a>&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>@alicesheridanstudio&nbsp;</p>\n<p>@louisefletcher_art&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Credits: \"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n",
