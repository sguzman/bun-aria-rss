  "description": "<p>Magali Guyon has been the technical director/ winemaker of <a href= \"https://chateaulacardonne.com/chateau-la-cardonne/\">Château La Cardonne</a> in the Médoc of Bordeaux for more than 20 years. Having worked in Bordeaux for some of the biggest names – she is the former winemaker at Château Lynch-Bages – she represents the best of the best in Bordeaux. <a href= \"https://chateaulacardonne.com/chateau-la-cardonne/\">Château La Cardonne</a> was recently awarded the prestigious Cru Bourgeois Supérieur title as well. <a href= \"https://chateaulacardonne.com/chateau-la-cardonne/\"><img class= \"alignnone size-medium wp-image-16783 aligncenter\" style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://www.winefornormalpeople.com/wp-content/uploads/2020/12/MagaliIG-300x300.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"300\" height=\"300\" /></a></p> <p>In this show, we take a different look at the Médoc (the prestigious Left Bank of Bordeaux) and approach it as a proposition of growing and terroir – not of pretty chateaux and expensive wines.
