  "description": "<p class=\"\"><strong>Show Notes</strong></p><p class=\"\">- Our special guest this week is romance author <a href=\"https://adrianaherreraromance.com/\">Adriana Herrera</a>. <a href=\"https://happyeverafter.usatoday.com/2018/11/20/american-dreamer-cover-reveal-adriana-herrera/\"><strong>American Dreamer</strong></a>, her debut novel with Carina Press, comes out in March of 2019.</p><p class=\"\"> -Jen interviewed Adriana about <a href=\"https://smartbitchestrashybooks.com/2018/09/domestic-violence-in-romance/\">domestic violence in romance</a> for the Smart Bitches.</p><p class=\"\">- Jen and Sarah both loved <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2Ux3hbz\"><strong>The Opposite of You</strong></a>, a food truck romance by Rachel Higginson, and Sil at Book Riot made a <a href=\"https://bookriot.com/2018/07/13/food-truck-romances/\">list of food truck romances</a>.</p><p class=\"\">- Kresley's historical trilogy is called <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2EbB5Fu\"><strong>The MacCarrick Brothers</strong></a>, and you can get all 3 bundled together, of course.</p><p class=\"\"> - There's nothing more amazing than warring think-pieces. So here's <a href=\"https://www.huffingtonpost.com/2015/06/03/f--kboy-definition-take-that-haters_n_7471142.html\">Huffington Post</a> and <a href=\"https://slate.com/human-interest/2015/08/what-does-fuckboy-mean.html\">Slate</a>teaching us about fuckboy, and <a href=\"https://jezebel.com/the-definition-of-fuckboy-is-not-what-bad-trend-pieces-1725157828\">Jezebel</a> telling us how they're doing it wrong.</p><p class=\"\">- The five witches' castes are warrior, healer, enchantress, conjurer, and sorceress. Jen's going to make a Buzzfeed Quiz that tells you which witch strength you'd have. (This is a lie. Jen does not know how to make Buzzfeed quizzes. But it's a good idea, right?)</p><p class=\"\"> -Speaking of vibrators, the best Romancelandia blog is the <a href=\"https://bawdybookworms.com/shop/\">Bawdy Bookworms</a>, which features review of both books and sex toys!</p><p class=\"\">- Here's a <a href=\"https://youtu.be/Hhk4N9A0oCA\">serious video explainer of the Hero's Journey</a>, and also a slightly more <a href=\"https://youtu.be/yZxs_jGN7Pg\">silly one</a>.</p><p class=\"\">- This blog is dedicated to looking at <a href=\"https://fairytalesandfeminismblog.wordpress.com/\">feminism and Snow White</a> in American culture.</p><p class=\"\">- <a href=\"https://mediaeducationlab.com/news/deconstructing-disney-lesson-plans\">Deconstruct Disney</a> for yourself or for your kids.</p><p class=\"\">- There's an IAD wiki, and it's pretty useful for when you're listing <a href=\"http://immortalsafterdarkiad.wikia.com/wiki/Haxa\">Hekate, Haxa, and can't remember the third one is Hela</a>.</p><p class=\"\">- As symbols, <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Apple_(symbolism)\">apples do a lot of heavy lifting</a>.</p><p class=\"\">- Mirrors and feminism have a long complicted history. And since we're talking action movies, check out this think piece by Carolyn Petit about <a href=\"https://feministfrequency.com/2017/02/22/hall-of-mirrors-facing-patriarchy-in-the-media-facing-ourselves/\">feminism, movie criticism, and John Wick's house of mirrors</a>. And then I found this article about <a href=\"https://lareviewofbooks.org/article/sylvia-plaths-magic-mirror/#!\">Sylvia Plath's senior thesis at Smith</a> and it's very far afield from the current topic, but this is a super interesting read.</p><p class=\"\">- <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2QGD7Eg\">Jack Ryan on Amazon</a>.</p><p class=\"\">- <a href=\"https://www.billboard.com/articles/news/8489733/cardi-b-teases-gold-look-money-music-video\">There isn't a video for Cardi B's <em>Money</em> yet</a>, but <a href=\"https://genius.com/Cardi-b-money-lyrics\">here are the lyrics</a>.</p><p class=\"\">- How young women have internatlized the <a href=\"https://tvo.org/article/current-affairs/how-girls-question-feminism-yet-embrace-girl-power\">Girl Power vs. Feminism</a> dichotomy.</p><p class=\"\"> - There's a <a href=\"http://www.thebuzzonhr.com/2018/03/14/blackblogsmatter-defining-inclusion-equality-and-equity/\">famous image that illustrates the difference between equality and equity</a>. It's most often used in the context of race, but can be used as a way to envision any kind of oppression.</p><p class=\"\">- <a href=\"https://jezebel.com/the-romance-novelists-guide-to-hot-consent-1822991922\">Romance has been thinking about consent</a> for a long time. Jen wrote a review of a graphic novel for teenagers called <a href=\"https://smartbitchestrashybooks.com/reviews/guest-review-consent-really-mean-pete-wallis-thalia-wallis/\"><strong>What Does Consent Really Mean</strong></a>?</p><p class=\"\">- Our next <a href=\"https://amzn.to/2QHsgtI\"><strong>Dark Needs at Night's Edge</strong></a> is next.</p><p class=\"\"><strong>Lost Limb Count<br>(Leg - 2, Arm - 1, Eye - 1)</strong></p><p class=\"\"><em>- Lachlain</em> tears off his own leg to reach Emma.

  "itunes:summary": "We’re three books into IAD this week, and it is happening! We're joined by the brilliant Adriana Herrera to talk Wicked Deeds on a Winter's Night, starring Bowen (the werewolf trapped in a tunnel of fire) and Mariketa the Awaited (the witch who is going to run him ragged)!\n\nAdriana, Jen & Sarah cover everything from Snow White to trauma survivors, jungle warfare to May-December romances, sexism and Cardi B. And we still find time to fangirl over Kresley's heroines.\n\nDon’t forget to subscribe to the podcast in your favorite podcasting platform — and while you’re there, please leave us a like or a review.\n\nOur next read (in two weeks) will be Dark Needs at Night's Edge — complete with a broken hero tied to a bed (vampire, obvi) and a haunting heroine who just wants to be seen (literally). This one makes for a LOT of opinions among IAD fans...you won’t want to miss it.\n\nGet ready for the read along at Amazon, Barnes & Noble, Apple Books or your local indie. Also, the Audible versions of IAD are on sale right now -- and WORTH EVERY PENNY! Listen on Audio!",
