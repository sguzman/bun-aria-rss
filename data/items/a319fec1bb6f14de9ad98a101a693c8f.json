    "media:description": "This yearâ€™s pumpkin weigh off took place at Fruittuin Verbeek Oldebroek. Even pumpkin growers from Belgium visited the event with their Atlantic Giants. Our Halloween pumpkin weighed 74 KG and is the heaviest Halloween pumpkin weight in the Netherlands! Our green Squash was also the heaviest of the Netherlands. Our Atlantic Giant was not as heavy as we hoped, but we are still very happy with the results. All together it was a wonderful pumpkin day. Of course we are already looking forward to next year's weigh off!  \n\n \n\n#pumpkins #pumpkinfarm #harvest #happyharvest #harvestseason #pumpkinseason #growlegendary #plagron #pompoen #pompoenen #pompoenseizoen #oogsten #pumpkinfestival #giantpumpkins #reuzenpompoenen #AtlanticGiant \n\n \n\nSwipe and subscribe! \n\n  \n\nSwipe and subscribe!
