  "description": "<p><p>Kirk Minihane loathes the Boston Globe and all of their dishonest, unethical, and shoddy writers. From Red Sox-worshipping profiles to inane Antonio Brown hot takes, the Globies are really outdoing themselves lately. The John Henry sports media conglomerate continues chugging along and most everyone looks the other way. Blind Mike defends the latest addition to Saturday Night Live. Joe Biden spins another yarn about his arch nemesis Corn Pop. The New York Times reignites a vicious smear campaign against Justice Brett Kavanaugh -- followed by an embarrassing correction. The wheels are in motion for the First Annual Steve Robinson Hot Dog Eating Contest, but Robinson isn't very confident. By the way, Kirk Minihane is a great father. </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
