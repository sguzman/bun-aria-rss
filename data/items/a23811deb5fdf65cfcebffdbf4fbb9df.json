  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, Dan Bongino from NRA TV fills in. President Trump’s masterful messaging in his recent 60 Minutes interview was an epic performance and a train wreck for Leslie Stahl. Stahl tried to corner Trump by \"framing\" questions that advance the liberal narrative. However, Trump re-frames the questions to avoid the pitfalls being set before him. The media paints Trump as a buffoon yet he constantly has them retreating, and always benefits from getting the last word. Then, Senator Elizabeth Warren has based her campaign on identity politics and it’s backfiring because it's inauthentic and average Americans see right through this. Trump is just a normal guy, battle scars and all but he's authentic unlike Bernie Sanders and Warren. Later, the top one percent of income-earners pay seven percentage points more than the bottom 90%. Yet Bernie Sanders and John Kerry don't seem to practice what they preach. Meanwhile, according to Bloomberg, hard-working small business owners struggle to build their businesses because the top 50% of tax payers pay 97% of all taxes. That means that only 1,400 taxpayers (the highest paid) pay as much income tax as the lowest paid 50% of all taxpayers.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
