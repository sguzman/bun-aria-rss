  "title": "Ep 103 | Who Is the Real Jesus? | Dallas Jenkins | The Glenn Beck Podcast",
  "description": "Dallas Jenkins is a storyteller. And he’s telling the most important story of all time in a way that many believed was impossible. Jenkins is the creator of “The Chosen,” a free, crowdfunded series about the life of Jesus that rivals Hollywood productions. And Season 2 could not have arrived at a better time — on Easter weekend 2021. Church attendance has dropped, people are hungry for something bigger than all of us, and many are choosing social justice activism, political parties, or even the climate change movement as \"religions\" over God. Glenn and Dallas break through the misconceptions about who Jesus really is and paint a clear picture of why America needs Emmanuel, “God with us,” now more than ever.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
