  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Today we’re talking real estate and crypto, and how to get started. Joe Robert grew up wanting to be independent, and so at a young age he started shoveling snow and doing landscaping.  Once he started working, he never stopped.  Joe was able to purchase his first property at the age of 19, which was unheard of back then.  He learned quickly that real estate was a great avenue to invest in.  Joe began his real estate career by establishing relationships and trust with the community.  </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Joe knows how to spot a quality property and location to invest in.  A lot of people are into flipping properties quickly, but often it can pay off to hold onto a property for 10+ years.  You can make passive income on it in the meantime and then sell when it’s appreciated enough. Another up and coming investment opportunity is in crypto.  Joe shares all his tips and tricks for getting started.
