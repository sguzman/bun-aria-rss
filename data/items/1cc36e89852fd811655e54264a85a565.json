While Ukrainian forces have proven remarkably successful at repelling the Russian advance so far, Russian forces have continued to make slow and steady progress into the country, with no clear resolution in sight. To get a sense of the state of the conflict and where it might be headed, Scott R. Anderson sat down with Michael Kofman, director of the Russia Studies Program at CNA and a leading analyst on the Ukraine conflict. They talked about what's gone wrong for Russia so far, how Western assistance is empowering the Ukrainians and how both sides are likely to adapt as the conflict enters its next stage.</p><p>Support this show <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"http://supporter.acast.com/lawfare\">http://supporter.acast.com/lawfare</a>.</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
