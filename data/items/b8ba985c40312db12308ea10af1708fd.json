Johnathan said \"I was camping with my family and we kept hearing this bonking sound in the woods. I had no idea what it was.</p> <p>Long story short I ended up seeing what I thought was a guy in a ghillie suit but the suit looked strange, it was too thick. That is when I saw the muscles flex on this creature. I never really thought about Bigfoot before this moment.\"</p>",
