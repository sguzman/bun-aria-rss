And so it's not just any single thing, and none of the challenges that we're facing, stop or respect, zip codes or political boundaries” [9:42]   “And so we have to actually be willing to lean into that drop. It's like skateboarding or snowboarding or anything, like you're standing on the lip of something steep, you don't fall back away from it, you actually have to lean into it, to stick the landing.” [17:52]   “...the point isn't to end the game victorious. The point is to keep playing for as long as possible, with as many people as possible.” [21:39]   “...the narrative challenge,[...] is actually, can we acknowledge that both are true? It's an incredibly complex quadratic equation. We don't know how it's going to turn out, our participation in it plays a big part in how it turns out. So we need to be vigilant and subtle, and adaptive, and responsive, all at once.” [30:28]   “No one beats our collective intelligence.” [57:12]   “grieve globally, [...] actually open our hearts to the wound of the world right now, and everyone and everything on it, but thrive locally.” [57:49]   “tribalism is destiny and humanism is optional” [1:02:33]   “we need to get more effective and more deliberate and more inclusive about our access to healing, inspiration and connection.” [1:10:31]   “...when we try and suppress the random and fickle and unknowable nature of existence, right, we tend to create more trauma, we tend to create more heartache, versus just bearing witness in the not knowing of it all.” [1:56:00]   “I wake up in the morning torn between the desire to save the world, or savor it.” [1:58:52]   “...instead of me trying to escape my mundane existence, I'm coming back to it. And I'm coming back to it with fresh eyes and an open heart and gratitude.” [2:04:23]   Follow Jamie Wheal: Website: <a href=\"https://www.recapturetherapture.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.recapturetherapture.com/</a> Website: <a href=\"https://www.flowgenomeproject.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.flowgenomeproject.com/</a> LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamie-wheal-887212a/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/jamie-wheal-887212a/</a> Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/Flowgenome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/Flowgenome</a> Instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/flowgenome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/flowgenome/</a>  ",
