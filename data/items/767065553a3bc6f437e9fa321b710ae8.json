  "description": "<div>In this week's Book Club podcast my guest is the doyen of war studies, Lawrence Freedman. His new book <em>Command: The Politics of Military Operations from Korea to Ukraine</em> takes a fascinating look at the interplay between politics and conflict in the post-war era. He tells me why dictators make bad generals, how soldiers are always playing politics, how the nuclear age has changed the calculus of conflict and gives me his latest read on the progress of the war in Ukraine.</div>\n",
