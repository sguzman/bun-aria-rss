In this episode I'll point out examples that look like intelligence but probably aren't - as well as an example of animal behavior that is really hard to dismiss as anything but \"smarts\".  In doing so we'll talk about the behavioral principle of \"chaining\" - the method by which you can get animals - and humans - to display some pretty sophisticated and complex behavior as the result of reinforcement, prompts and cues.</p>\n<p> </p>",
