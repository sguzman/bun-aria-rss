  "description": "On Friday’s Mark Levin Show, the Roe v. Wade decision has been overturned by the Supreme Court, but it began to unravel 20 years ago with the Casey decision. The court never had a right to rule on abortion, and today the court returned power that should have never been taken in the first place. Roe v. Wade upended 180 years of jurisprudence when it was wrongly decided. The case violated the equal protection rights of the unborn baby, which the court deemed viable in their decision. This decision takes the federal court out of the bedroom. Most Democrats and media mouthpieces haven't even read the Roe or Casey decisions, which is why they don't understand today's decisions and concurrences. Later, Sen. Mike Lee joins the show to explain how the Constitution was vindicated by the Court's correction of this erroneous law made by a judicial oligarchy imposing its own will, and as a result, more babies can live their lives. Afterward, President Biden attempts to blame Trump for his concerted effort to appoint three Justices that would overturn Roe V. Wade. And Speaker Nancy Pelosi was beside herself in grief over the Court's decision. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
