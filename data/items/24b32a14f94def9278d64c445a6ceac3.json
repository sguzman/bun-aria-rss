He shares his thoughts on San Francisco 49ers QB Trey Lance getting injured and Jimmy Garoppolo leading them to a 27-7 over the Seattle Seahawks. Does he think Tua Tagovailoa is elite after his 6 TD performance over Lamar Jackson & the Baltimore Ravens? What did he make of the fight between Tampa Bay Bucs WR Mike Evans & New Orleans Saints CB Marshon Lattimore & why does Tom Brady struggle vs Saints? Are the Cincinnati Bengals suffering from a Super Bowl hangover after their loss to the Dallas Cowboys or can Joe Burrow rally them from an 0-2 start? Richard gives his take on the Cleveland Browns blown victory over Joe Flacco & the New York Jets. Lastly, the Denver Broncos & Los Angeles Rams are in trouble despite their wins because of their quarterbacks Russell Wilson & Matthew Stafford and their awful offensive lines. #volume #Herd #colincowherd</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
