  "description": "On today's show, Pat addresses the events that have unfolded in Kenosha, Wisconsin with Jacob Blake and where things go from here, as we attempt to bring you a unifying, feel good show with some good messages. First, Super Bowl Champion, 22 Year NFL Head Coach, a man who possesses one of the greatest mustaches alive, Jeff Fisher joins the program. Pat and Jeff chat about a FanDuel fantasy football contest that he's excited to be a part of and how it differs from traditional fantasy football. They also discuss the impact an NFL locker room can have and why they both think society needs a little bit more of that right now. Jeff also tells some hilarious stories from his time coaching, and chats about whether or not he has the itch to get back on the sideline (3:28-30:13). Next, 12 Year NFL veteran at Quarterback, ESPN NFL analyst, and one of the newest co-hosts of NFL Live, friend of the show, Dan Orlovsky joins the program. Pat and Dan chat about Mike Tannenbaum's recent comments on Get Up! that Ben Roethlisberger is the 4th best QB in the AFC North, why Dan doesn't think the Patriots are a playoff team despite acquiring Cam Newton, what the new cast of NFL Live will bring to the table, why he has some concerns with the 49ers, and why Pat inspires him (31:37-47:03). Lastly is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk where Pat and AJ cover everything going on around the NFL including the Cowboys potentially landing Earl Thomas, how much the different gameday atmospheres will potentially affect the players, whether or not the Big Ten is still officially dead, and much much more (48:07-1:34:13).
