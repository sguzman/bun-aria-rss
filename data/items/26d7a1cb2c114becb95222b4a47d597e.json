  "description": "<p>Despite billions of dollars being invested into cancer treatment every year, cancer is the second leading cause of death in the US. Cancer is one of the most prevalent health issues our society is facing today. Its devastating reach has impacted millions of people worldwide, hurting folks and their loved ones physically, emotionally, and financially.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p>Over the past few decades, we’ve accepted cancer as a genetic mutation, or an unlucky hand that some of us just happen to be dealt. However, our recent understanding of cancer offers a new hope.

You’re going to learn about real world, sustainable changes you can make to reduce your cancer risk, and how to be more empowered about your overall health.
