  "description": "<p>Saddle up, mommies! The Main Mommies got horses in the back! It's time for some Pony Play fun! Mommy Tina isn't just a regular mom, she's a COOL mom and she's discovered TikTok. There are some special people on there for sure. Many listeners/viewers have chimed in about Christina's weird lack of drying off and we also have a new Fart Simpson call! Plus, farts, John Travolta and a scandal regarding one of Tom's trademarked phrases!</p> <p>Next, joining us in studio is the duo behind the H3H3 Productions, Ethan and Hila Klein! They talk about their H3 baby that's due any moment and all the pregnancy weight gained by the husbands. Mommy Tina's love for BBC leads to a discussion about racism in pornography and would you rather be blind or have a micropeener? Ball Hogs, plastic surgery and H3's \"Instagram vs Reality\" controversy all get discussed, plus SO much more!</p>\n",
