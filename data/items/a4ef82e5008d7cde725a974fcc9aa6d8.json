  "description": "Michelle Markel, an award-winning author and former journalist who has written for The Wall Street Journal and Los Angeles Times, talks about books she’s written about two strong and brave women Clara Lemlich and Hillary Rodham Clinton. The first book, Brave Girl: Clara and the Shirtwaist Makers Strike of 1909 (Balzer + Bray, 2013), is illustrated by Caldecott Honor Artist Melissa Sweet and tells the story of Clara Lemlich, a young Ukrainian immigrant who led the largest strike of women workers in U.S. history. The book follows the plight of immigrants in America in the early 1900s, tackling topics like activism and the U.S. garment industry, and includes an extensive bibliography and authors notes about the garment industry at that time.\n\nMarkel’s book, Hillary Rodham Clinton: Some Girls Are Born to Lead (Balzer + Bray, 2016), is about the woman we’ve all come to know and who, like Clara Lemlich sixty years earlier, has refused to accept the status quo of women in society and in the workplace. Published in January 2016 and illustrated by LeUyen Pham, Markel’s telling of Hillary Clinton’s story begins with Clinton’s early life and shows the grit and determination its taken to aspire to the highest level of achievement any woman or man can attain, the Presidency of the United States.\n\n\n\nSusan Raab is president of Raab Associates, an internationally recognized agency that specializes in marketing literature, products and initiatives that help improve the lives of young people. Clients have included National Geographic, Scholastic, the International Board on Books for Young People, and bestselling authors and illustrators. Susan is marketing advisor for the Society of Children’s Book Writers and Illustrators (SCBWI). She’s also a journalist reporting on publishing, education and human rights. Her work as a broadcast correspondent has been hosted by the University of Connecticut, and by the University of Florida’s Recess Radio, a program syndicated to 500 public radio stations.
