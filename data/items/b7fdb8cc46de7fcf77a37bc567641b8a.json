  "description": "<p>Nearly half of Americans wouldn't be able to easily handle a $400 emergency! This is financial insanity. Considering the lack of any sort of margin in our lives today, it shouldn't be a surprise that Americans treat their money any differently than they treat their time. There just never seems to be enough, and any disruption (of money or time) brings a myriad of problems that must be addressed. Living paycheck to paycheck has unfortunately become the norm and it's a problem that needs to be addressed.</p><p>The answer is to create an emergency fund! Having an emergency fund allows us to weather these small storms, and most importantly reduces stress. In this episode we discuss what an emergency fund is, what it is for (and not for), and how to get started on your own- including where to put that money! Listen to the entire episode to learn what steps you can take today, regardless of your financial situation.</p><p>At the beginning of this episode we each cracked open and enjoyed a beer called Liliko'i Kepolo by Avery Brewing, a Belgian-style white ale which you can learn all about on Untappd.
