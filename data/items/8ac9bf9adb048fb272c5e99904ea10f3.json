  "description": "Paul prayed for the Ephesians “that God would grant you, according to the riches of His glory, to be strengthened with might through His Spirit in the inner man” (Ephesians 3:16). The inner man is strengthened by God through the Spirit. We have to take time; we have to find room in our busy lives to let the Spirit of God minister life to us, to be touched by the Word of God and the very presence of Almighty God because that’s what strengthens our inner man. We cannot neglect our inner man or we’ll be weak, undisciplined, and weary on the inside. Today I encourage you to develop your personal relationship with God on a daily basis. Make it a habit to renew and strengthen your inner man because that’s how your life will be transformed.<p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
