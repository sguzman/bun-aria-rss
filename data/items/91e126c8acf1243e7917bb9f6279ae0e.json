Senior moments coming early or feel absent-minded?</p> <p>It’s quite common these days for a lot of people to not have focus, unable to maintain concentration, and lack mental energy. It’s no surprise that we’re overloaded, distracted, and overstimulated that it’s easy to feel like your mind is fleeting.</p> <p>But it doesn’t have to be that way. Even with age, your brain doesn’t have to decline. It can get better, and you can “turn it back on.”</p> <p>To talk about this topic, I have a very special guest today. He’s a dear friend of mine, Dave Asprey.</p> <p>He is the founder of Bulletproof and author of New York Times bestseller, The Bulletproof Diet, and his new book, Super Human. He is a Silicon Valley investor and technology entrepreneur who spent two decades hack his own biology.</p> <p>In this episode, he will share some of his tips (you may not hear of before) to turn your brain back on.</p> <p>** Do you want to stay up to date with every new episode and get my brand new Kwik Brain Accelerator Program?
