  "description": "Thank you so much for tuning into another weird ass episode of the Tin Foil Hat's Secret Society of the Mad Hatters. This episode we welcome Canada's dark jester,  Jason Rouse, down and the bunker.  Going to be straight up honest with you this starts off really dirty and weird for sure.  I know some of you don't like it dirty and I'm sorry about that. I'm going to put out a special video for you all to make up for the crude shit that we get into.  Once Tripoli kicks Jason out the second half gets better with some good old conspiracy talk between the Lion and the Goof! Thank you for your support and enjoy the episode.",
