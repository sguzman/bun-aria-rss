  "description": "<ul>\n<li>The Court of MuggleCast is now in session.</li>\n<li>We all offer our individual opinions on the case and identify the key players.</li>\n<li>The trial was very emotional for both Jo and Steve but did it have to get to this point?</li>\n<li>Why did RDR initially make it so difficult for Warner Bros. to obtain a copy of the book?</li>\n<li>Why did Steve ask for a clause in his contract saying RDR Books would defend him should a lawsuit occur?</li>\n<li>Steve initially said he would never publish the Lexicon because “that would be illegal”.</li>\n<li>We review testimony given and comments made by both sides and offer our thoughts.</li>\n<li>Breaking down the “fair use” doctrine, we try and get inside the head of Judge Patterson.</li>\n<li>Which of the four categories of fair use would go in Jo or Steve’s favor?</li>\n<li>The negative impact this could have on the Harry Potter fandom and the “floodgates” that could open.</li>\n<li>We take a look at fan and media opinions of this trial.</li>\n<li>Elysa brings up a few previous court cases that have dealt with the “fair use” doctrine and the precedents set seem to favor J.K. Rowling and Warner Bros. (Harper and Roe Publishers vs. Nation Enterprises).</li>\n<li>Why MuggleNet’s book never faced a lawsuit – it offered commentary, analysis and theory.</li>\n<li>Make the Music Connection provides some laughter after a very serious episode.</li>\n</ul>\n<div><br>\n</div>\n",
