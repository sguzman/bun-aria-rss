  "description": "This week on the Mark Levin Show, Mark reflects on the passing of WABC radio host Bernard McGuirk. Americans of all races, creeds, and color united to help save one another during times of natural distance like a hurricane. Still, if you watch the media, they pretend to be for the people, but their actions prove the opposite. Biden is reportedly tapping tax dollars to boost Dem registration. President Biden has unleashed a war on American energy independence and the leftwing alliance for electricity (disguised as climate change activism) is ideological and insane. The country doesn't have enough electricity to go around, especially since it takes fossil fuels to create electricity in the first place. We have a president bankrupting our economic system and making reckless comments about nuclear Armageddon. Yet, the media says that Donald Trump is the biggest threat to our country. If Biden seriously thoughtwe were facing a nuclear strike from Putin he should probably be in the situation room with military officials instead of talking smack at a Democrat Party fundraiser. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
