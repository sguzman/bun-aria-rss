  "description": "<p>If you are facing a difficulty you don’t know how to bear, a decision you don’t know how to make, or a complicated relationship you don’t know how to navigate, what you’re feeling is the need for wisdom. This simple yet profound passage is a great poetic hymn to wisdom, and it shows us that we can only find wisdom in God. In this sermon, we will see 1) The absolute importance of wisdom; 2) The only source of wisdom (God); and 3) How you can get wisdom.</p>\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on May 22, 2011. Series: To Know the Living God – The Adequacy of God. Scripture: Job 28:9-15; 20-28.</p>\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.
