  "description": "<p>As moms, our greatest hope is that our children come to know and love Jesus, developing a deep relationship with the one true God as they mature. And we know that the best way we can impart our faith on our children is nurture, teach, model and encourage them in Biblical truths as we live out the gospel in our daily life. But often, that desire is so great, we inadvertently bear the burden of their eternal future on our shoulders, drowning us in guilt, fear and false responsibility. In this episode, Emily and Laura discuss the common pitfalls in trying to \"secure\" our children's faith, and explain how moms can trust God with our children as we continue to be faithful to out the redemption story in our everyday life.</p> <p> </p> <p>Like what you hear? Visit <a href= \"http://www.risenmotherhood.com\">www.risenmotherhood.com</a> for links to additional articles and resources on this topic. You'll also find more encouragement and truth on how to be an intentional mother that cares for and loves her children with eternity in mind. And if you get a chance, we'd love for you to subscribe and/or leave a review in iTunes!</p>",
