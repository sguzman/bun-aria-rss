  "description": "<p>This forty-third episode of the Philosophy Bakes Bread radio show and podcast is a special new show format, more of a round-table discussion than usual, and with a new theme: The Stories of Our Day. In this first \"Stories of Our Day\" episode, we're talking about The Game of Thrones! For this discussion, we knew that we wanted to bring Dr. Shane Courtland back on the show, given his specialty in Thomas Hobbes's somewhat bleak philosophy, which has a lot to tell us about the harshness and quasi-realism (if you focus on human beings rather than the dragons) of Game of Thrones. </p> <p>Dr. Courtland was our guest once before, in Episode 8 of the show, on \"<a href= \"https://www.philosophersinamerica.com/2017/03/05/012-ep8-selfish-ethics/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Selfish Ethics?</a>\" <a href= \"http://business.wvu.edu/faculty-staff/directory/profile?pid=192\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Dr. Courtland</a> is director of the Center for Free Entreprise at Western Virginia University. His recent book is titled <a href=\"http://amzn.to/2k6WaIA\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\"><em>Hobbesian Applied Ethics and Public Policy</em></a>, and was released with Routledge Press in 2017. </p> <p>Listen for our “You Tell Me!” questions and for some jokes in one of our concluding segments, called “Philosophunnies.” Reach out to us on Facebook <a href= \"https://www.facebook.com/philosophybakesbread/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@PhilosophyBakesBread</a> and on Twitter <a href=\"http://twitter.com/PhilosophyBB\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">@PhilosophyBB</a>; email us at <a href=\"mailto:philosophybakesbread@gmail.com\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">philosophybakesbread@gmail.com</a>; or call and record a voicemail that we play on the show, at 859.257.1849.
