  "description": "Erika G. King learned a lot during research for her book, Obama, the Media, and Framing the U.S. Exit from Iraq and Afghanistan (Ashgate, 2014), but one item surprised her a bit more than most.\n\n“One might have thought, but one would be wrong. . . that media organizations might just come together and say, ‘Yes, Iraq was a difficult war, but we accomplished something, and now it’s over and things can be seen in a slightly positive light,’ ” King said. “But I found it very interesting that journalists for these national media organizations used Obama’s moment in the sun to present some very negative outlooks about what Iraq had represented to talk about–how many of them felt culpable in their early interpretations and support of the Iraq war.”\n\nObama, the Media, and Framing the U.S. Exit from Iraq and Afghanistan is a qualitative look at narratives and shifting rhetoric. King’s research reveals the interplay between the Obama administration and the media during this crucial and recent period of American history.\n\nScholars and consumers of journalism and political science research will find this book to be an invaluable addition to their collection.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
