  "description": "<p>It’s a big season for Next Question with Katie Couric because this fall Katie is going to dive into … Katie! With the release of her memoir, “Going There,” on Oct. 26, Next Question will be sharing exclusive podcast-only conversations between Katie and some of her closest friends, family and confidants. And in the lead up to the book’s publication, Katie will explore some of the biggest news stories — and the people behind them — that she has covered over the decades. This season will take fans and listeners behind the scenes of both the making of her memoir and the making of her extraordinary (and sometimes tumultuous) personal and professional life. So, come for Katie’s signature curiosity and no holds barred interviews, but stay for her own revealing answers. New season starts Sept. 30 and brand new episodes every Thursday.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
