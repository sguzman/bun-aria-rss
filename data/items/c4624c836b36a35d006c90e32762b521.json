  "description": "<p>If you’re into Ayurveda, dharma, goddesses, yoga shakti, kundalini, meditation and all things Vedic-- you gotta learn about Vedic astrology! It’s the sister science of these practices and the word Jyotish means “the science of the stars.” Jyotish is the eldest form of astrology and accounts for the Earth’s shift in its axis, which Western astrology did not, therefore it measures where the planets and constellations actually are in the sky today. I have found it extremely accurate and helpful in my journey and wanted to share one of the world’s top Vedic Astrologers and Ayurvedic Doctors, as well as a dear mentor of mine Dr. Suhas with my Highest Self Podcast community.
