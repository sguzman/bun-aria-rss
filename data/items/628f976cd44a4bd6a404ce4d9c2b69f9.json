  "description": "<p>There’s no playbook for successfully releasing music during a pandemic. Especially if you’re an indie artist, the stakes really couldn’t be higher. But Deep Sea Diver has managed to put all that aside to drop a thrilling and relevant new album. While the Seattle-based band’s only recently started to find their place in the indie rock landscape, Jessica Dobson has played in some of the genre’s most defining bands. She toured the world as the lead guitarist for Beck and The Shins, and played keyboard and bass for the Yeah, Yeah, Yeahs. In 2015, Jessica formed Deep Sea Diver with her husband and drummer Peter Mansen. In the wake of their new album, Broken Record producer Leah Rose talked to Jessica about how a stay-at-home livestream series inspired her to write a pandemic anthem in record time. Jessica also talks about how volunteering at a shelter for homeless sex workers helped her overcome a viscious bout of depression and write what she considers the best album of her career.</p><p>Subscribe to Broken Record's YouTube channel to hear old and new interviews, often with bonus content: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast\">https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast</a></p><p>You can also check out past episodes here: <a href=\"https://brokenrecordpodcast.com/\">https://brokenrecordpodcast.com/</a></p><p>You can find some of our favorite Deep Sea Diver songs by clicking <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/3L3nF8nGelAV4XqL9zwfgm?si=cLhv2zzIRJSUTUgwdXmq5A\">HERE — enjoy!</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
