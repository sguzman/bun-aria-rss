  "description": "<p>Robert Kelly met me on the stoop outside the Comedy Cellar. He's gotten way into cigars in the last few years. So we sat outside the club and he told me all about stogies as we smoked two possibly Cuban bats that I bought in Costa Rica two days before. Cameos galore from Mike Yard, Liz, Norton, and Keith Robinson. And a really embarrassing story at the end of the outro. I'm disgusting sometimes.</p>",
