But we've still got unsettled business: Steve from Providence must walk 100-miles from the flophouse he sleeps in to the VFW hall he denigrated and Louis must eat a bean supper out of the studio shitter. Barry Levine, author of \"The Spider: Inside the Criminal Web of Jeffrey Epstein and Ghislaine Maxwell,\" joins the show to talk with Kirk about the late financiers ties to Bill Clinton, Donald Trump, his mysterious suicide, and more (0:29:00). Intern Justin took a shot at redemption and came up short (0:58:00). Social media CEOs logged on for a Zoom hearing in which they received their ritualistic condemnations from conservative politicians (1:04:00). The Ringer's movie podcast took on Sacha Baron Cohen's latest movie and the result was just bizarre (1:11:00).</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
