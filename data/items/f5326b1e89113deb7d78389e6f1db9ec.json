Each cubby housed a fresh, hot portion of food on a small plate. It could be anything from a side of peas to a turkey sandwich, to a slice of pie. You simply put in some nickels, and then the door to that cubby would unlock and you could take the plate that was inside. This automated food experience has reemerged in new restaurants today.</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://99percentinvisible.org/?p=28861&post_type=episode\" target=\"_blank\">The Automat</a></p>\n<p>Plus, we revisit the story of when food advertising was revolutionized by motion.</p>\n",
