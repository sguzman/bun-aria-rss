  "title": "Ego Is The Enemy by Ryan Holiday",
  "description": "'Ego is the Enemy' is an in-depth look into how ego plays a destructive part in the ability to live a productive and fulfilling life. The book is not written on the experience of the author but references famous philosophers such as Seneca explaining that ego can negatively impact an individual. Using historical figures as a reference, the author gives a blueprint for how we as the reader can avoid the unfavourable principles that ego presents. Instead of providing a list of steps to avoid our ego, Holiday explains in detail the adverse impact ego can and most likely will have if gone unchecked. The book is written in such a way to inspire the reader without overwhelming them at the same time. We are all subject to our ego at times of aspiration, success and failure; therefore this book is a must-read for all. I rate this book five stars.\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
