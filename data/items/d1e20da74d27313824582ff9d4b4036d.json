  "description": "Marc Lichtenfeld, chief income strategist at The Oxford Club, is back on the show to discuss the economy… income opportunities… and biotech. He explains why the market pullback is great for income investors… how to accelerate the long-term compounding process—a financial phenomenon most investors ignore… and why he’s looking at bonds for income.  Income investors should also consider Unlimited Income, where the average recommendation is still up… and spitting out consistent cash payments month after month—despite the recent pullback. Marc shares how he finds great bonds… how to avoid simple bond investing mistakes… and why investors don’t need to worry about stocks when they practice one simple bond strategy. We also discuss the volatility in biotech… and the solid risk/reward setup he sees right now.  In this episode   Why Marc thinks the market will go lower [2:40] How investors can accelerate compounding [5:22] Individual bonds vs. bond funds and ETFs [12:00] Marc’s methodology for investing in individual bonds [16:05] Income stocks Marc likes right now [18:52]  A solid risk/reward setup in biotech [22:13]  Enjoyed this episode?
