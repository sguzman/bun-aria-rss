  "description": "This episode features bestselling author Robert Wright making the case for why Buddhism was right about human nature: its diagnosis that our suffering is mainly due to a failure to see reality clearly, and its prescription that meditation can help us see more clearly. Robert and Julia discuss whether it's suspicious that a religion turned out to be \"right\" about human nature, what it means for emotions to be true or false, and whether there are downsides to enlightenment.",
