  "description": "DJ and Bucky are back with a new episode. First, the pair take a look back at their initial thoughts of quarterbacks Lamar Jackson and Deshaun Watson after the two QBs faced off in 2016 during college and the guys discuss why each QB is special (1:57). Next, DJ and Bucky react to LSU QB Joe Burrow and Alabama QB Tua Tagovailoa's matchup from this past weekend, while giving their analysis on the skillset of each player (14:20). After, the duo talk about some of the top wide receivers in college football and explain why this upcoming wide receiver draft class is one of the deepest in history (29:47). Then, the guys compare the top first-round and second-round wide receivers in the last four drafts and see which group is performing better in the NFL (36:30). Later, DJ breaks out another edition of \"hits & misses\" as he looks back at two players he missed on from the 2016 NFL Draft (48:16). To wrap up the show, the pair answer fan questions, which were left in the reviews (54:22).<p>Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
