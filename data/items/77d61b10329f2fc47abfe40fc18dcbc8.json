  "description": "<p>This week, I'm speaking to Mike Grosswendt who is the CEO and Founder of All Coast Construction, a construction company based on the west coast of the US.</p> <p>Mike focuses his attention onto new construction and restorations. He's worked with many world-renowned architects. He's worked with an incredible array of A-list celebrities as well including Quincy Jones. He's recently completed the home of Robert Downey Junior and his wife Susan, which is based in Malibu; quite an incredible and unusual architectural feat. He's currently working on a remodel of a 27,000 sq ft home for Charles Gwathmey, again, in Malibu.</p> <p>In this conversation, Mike and I talked about his beginnings, how he began as a carpenter, and how he won projects in the early days. We get a really good insight into the workings of a construction business, how a contractor views modern construction, what makes a good relationship between contractor and architect, and all the different nuances of making construction profitable, and the complexities of running a business.</p> <p> </p> <p>► Access your free training at http://SmartPracticeMethod.com/</p> <p>► If you want to speak directly to our advisors, book a call at https://www.businessofarchitecture.com/call</p> <p>► Subscribe to my YouTube Channel for updates:</p> <p>https://www.youtube.com/c/BusinessofArchitecture</p> <p>*******<br /> For more free tools and resources for running a profitable, impactful, and fulfilling practice, connect with me on:<br /> Facebook: https://www.facebook.com/groups/businessofarchitecture<br /> Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/enoch.sears/<br /> Website: https://www.businessofarchitecture.com/<br /> Twitter: https://twitter.com/BusinessofArch<br /> Podcast: http://www.businessofarchitecture.com/podcast/<br /> iTunes: https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/business-architecture-podcast/id588987926<br />  Android Podcast Feed: http://feeds.feedburner.com/BusinessofArchitecture-podcast</p> <p>*******</p> <p>Access the FREE Architecture Firm Profit Map video here: http://freearchitectgift.com</p> <p>Download the FREE Architecture Firm Marketing Process Flowchart video here: http://freearchitectgift.com</p> <p>Come to my next live, in-person event: https://www.businessofarchitecture.com/live</p> <p>Carpe Diem!</p>",
