Waiting to hear about unemployment aid, or job opportunities. Waiting to hear about loved ones in the hospital. And even though the end of 2020 does not mean the end of these hardships, many of us are letting out a sigh of relief as we say goodbye to this difficult year. This week on <em>Hidden Brain</em>, we look at the psychology of relief and waiting, and how we can make periods of limbo less painful.</p>\n",
