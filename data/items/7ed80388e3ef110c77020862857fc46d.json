  "description": "<p>“Well, this is the thing about being an overnight success after forty years.” Bernardine Evaristo made history when <em>Girl, Woman, Other</em> won the 2019 Booker Prize, for she is the first Black woman and the first Black British person to have won the coveted prize in its more than fifty-year history. Bernardine joins us on the show to talk about her fabulous memoir, <em>Manifesto: On Never Giving</em> <em>Up</em>, “overnight fame” (after decades of work in literature and the theater), her creative process, the writers who’ve inspired her work in the theater and on the page—and she even offers some advice for those who are stuck in their work and see no way through. Featured books: Manifesto: On Never Giving Up and Girl, Woman, Other by Bernardine Evaristo and For Colored Girls Who Have Considered Suicide / When the Rainbow Is Enuf by Ntozake Shange. Poured Over is produced and hosted by Miwa Messer and engineered by Harry Liang. Follow us here for new episodes Tuesdays and Thursdays (with occasional bonus episodes on Saturdays).</p>",
