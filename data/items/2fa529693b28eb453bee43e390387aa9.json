Because of their roles as pivotal healthcare providers in the midst of a pandemic, the two were forced to nurse themselves back to health while remotely navigating an overhaul in how they provided healthcare. There were some big questions to answer: How could they make sure patient information was safe and secure while working from home? How could all parts of the hospital connect with each other? Most importantly, how could they get the information they needed -- in real time? The answers for those working remotely in healthcare and in so many industries, can be found in the cloud.
