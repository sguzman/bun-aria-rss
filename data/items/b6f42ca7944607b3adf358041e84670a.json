  "description": "Hey HBs! On this last week of hiatus, we're bringing you Tessa Dare's The Duchess Deal! This episode was the birth of recurring bits like Queen Bird, Darkwing Duke, Werecunt, and more. It was originally aired in 2 episodes, but you're getting the full experience in one shot! We've got a strong, survivor seamstress, a Duke marred by burn wounds, and a marriage of convenience turned redemptive love. This is Melody's favorite heroine and Erin's favorite hero from the brain of Tessa Dare. There's also a colorful cast of side characters including a street cat named Breeches. There's badminton, rain, a jailbreak, cursing in Shakespeare, and HOT HOT SEX. \n Bonus content: the Alaskan phenomenon that is the drive up bikini coffee bar, burping on cue in the name of motherhood, Erin's thoroughly-researched grasp on historical time periods, and our vast knowledge of fireplaces. Does Melody know what animals are? Or sounds? And seriously, what does \"make ready\" mean in England times???\n Alright, darlings, WERECUNTS UNITE!\n Self love recommendations: \n Erin: \"You have to give up being perfect to be good, and give up being good to be free.\" Let that wash over you. \n Melody: When Things Fall Apart: Heart Advice for Difficult Times by Pema Chodron\nMentioned in this episode:\nPreorder Naima Simone X Friends Book Boyfriend Box!!\nThis box has EVERYTHING you could ever want in a book boyfriend from Tessa Bailey, Avery Flynn, Farrah Rochon, Jayci Lee, Kennedy Ryan, Adriana Herrera, and Naima Simone.\nYou can look forward to paperbacks, signed book plates, limited edition book boyfriend mugs, the book boyfriend pajamas/loungewear, bookmarks and more!\nTiers include:\n- Cinnamon Roll - $114.99\n- The Alpha - - $169.99 \nEnter the promo code BONKERS10 at checkout to receive $10 off!!! \nONLY AVAILABLE UNTIL OCT 10, 2022!\nIf you have any questions, email orders@honeymagnolia.co.\nhttps://heaving-bosoms.captivate.fm/nsbookboyfriends (Naima's Book Boyfriends)\nSeptember in the Temple!\n- This month we're back with Katee regaling us with more Fertile in My Ex-Boyfriend’s Dungeon (and we discover an actual hard limit for Katee!), and Hannah Whitten is going to stop by to give us all her best spooky season recs. \n- In Book Club news, everyone in the Joy Bringer and Celebrant tiers can download their ebooks of MY WICKED PRINCE by Molly O’Keefe and the entire audiobook collection of COURT OF THE VAMPIRE QUEEN by Katee Robert! \n- And finally, Joy Bringers and Celebrants can check out all the digital art we’ve created for the Temple!
