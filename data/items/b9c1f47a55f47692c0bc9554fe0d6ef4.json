When you’re tired on the inside, it’s all too easy to feel drained, overwhelmed, and like nothing is going to change.</p>\n<p>In “Tired On The Inside,” Pastor Steven shares from the story of the woman at the well in John 4, showing us how powerful rest can be — if we’re looking for it in the right places.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>But what if one of the reasons we’re tired all the time is because we’ve been going to the wrong well? What if we’ve been running to sources of stress instead of God’s source of rest?</p>\n<p>Being weary doesn’t mean we’re weak. Maybe it just means we’ve been “filling up” in the wrong places. Maybe we’re tired because we’ve been pushing against what God is trying to call us into.</p>\n<p>He said, “Come to me, all you who are weary and burdened, and I will give you rest” (Matthew 11:28).&nbsp;Are you ready for true rest?</p>\n",
