  "title": "John Fonte, “Sovereignty or Submission?: Will Americans Rule Themselves or Be Ruled By Others” (Encounter Books, 2011)",
  "description": "In his new book, Sovereignty or Submission: Will Americans Rule Themselves or be Ruled by Others? (Encounter Books, 2011), John Fonte, Senior Fellow and Director of the Center for American Common Culture at Hudson Institute, discusses the rise of post-democratic global governing agencies, as well as the inherent problems they pose to American sovereignty. Fonte argues that, for these global governing agencies to succeed, American self-governance must become second to transnational governing organizations, including an alteration of the U.S. Constitution to include a provision for “evolving norms of international law.” In our interview, we talked about the rise of transnational progressives, which American politicians are sympathetic to this concept, and how America can best retain its sovereignty. Read all about it, and more, in Fonte’s troubling new book. Please become a fan of “New Books in Public Policy” on Facebook if you haven’t already.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
