  "description": "Dr. Mehmet Oz, Senate candidate for Pennsylvania, joins Clay and Buck to discuss his plans to crack down on crime, illegal immigration, and focus on the economy. Why won’t John Fetterman debate Dr. Oz? Larry Summers: \"More likely than not\" we’ll have a recession in the next 12-18 months. Kelly Tshibaka, Senate candidate for Alaska, talks with C&B about ranked choice voting, how her RINO opponent, Lisa Murkowski, has gotten increasingly liberal over her 21 years in the Senate, is now a key Biden ally, and is completely out of step with Alaskans. Great new ad from Ron DeSantis; it's from the heart and featuring his wife, Florida first lady Casey DeSantis.<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
