  "itunes:summary": "<p>Hallie Mahowald is the programs director for <a href=\"https://westernlandowners.org/\">Western Landowners Alliance</a>, a landowner-led group that advances policies and practices that sustain working lands, connected landscapes, and native species. At WLA, Hallie manages people and strategy to support private stewardship across the West. She holds a B.A. in Environmental Science from the University of Denver and a M.A. in International Environmental Policy from the Middlebury Institute of International Studies at Monterey. In conjunction with her academic studies and early career in the non-profit sector, she worked on many natural resources management and sustainable development projects in the American West and Central and South America. Hallie currently serves on the advisory board of Colorado State University's Center for Collaborative Conservation and as vice president on the board of directors for the Central Colorado Conservancy.</p><p>We talked all about the reintroduction of Grey Wolves to Colorado, from the original ballot initiative that set it in motion, to the various arguments, to the management implications. It’s a complex issue that will require a whole lot of cooperation and experimentation. Lucky for us, Hallie is on the stakeholder advisory group that is helping to navigate all this. We also touched on public land cattle grazing, something I want to understand better and maybe cover on the podcast more fully in the future. Finally, we discussed a few of WLA’s various programs, which include their Habitat Lease Partnership program, the Working Wild Challenge, and Women in Ranching.
