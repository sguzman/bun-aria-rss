  "description": "Last fall, doctors from all over America took to social media with the hashtag #ThisIsMyLane (or #ThisIsOurLane). They sent pictures of themselves in blood-drenched scrubs and shared stories of treating victims of shootings. They were responding to a tweet from the NRA chiding them for speaking out about gun violence. Who are these doctors who have seen the worst results of gun violence—and still own guns? Guest: Dr. Brendan Campbell, pediatric surgeon at Connecticut Children's Medical Center in Hartford, Connecticut.  This episode first aired on Nov. 15, 2018.  Tell us what you think by leaving a review on Apple Podcasts or sending an email to whatnext@slate.com.
