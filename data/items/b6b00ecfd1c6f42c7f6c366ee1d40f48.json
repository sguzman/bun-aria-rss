  "description": "<p>The bulk-edge correspondence (BEC) is the hallmark of topological systems. In\ncontinuous (non-lattice) Hermitian systems with unbounded wavevector it was\nrecently shown that the BEC is modified. How would it be further affected in\nnon-Hermitian systems, experiencing loss and/or gain? In this work we take the\nfirst step in this direction, by studying a Hermitian continuous system with\nnon-Hermitian boundary conditions. We find in this case that edge modes emerge\nat roots of the scattering matrix, as opposed to the Hermitian case, where they\nemerge at poles (or, more accurately, coalescence of roots and poles). This\nentails a nontrivial modification to the relative Levinson's theorem. We then\nshow that the topological structure remains the same as in the Hermitian case,\nand the generalized BEC holds, provided one employs appropriate modified\ncontours in the wavevector plane, so that the scattering matrix phase winding\ncounts the edge modes correctly. We exemplify all this using a paradigmatic\nmodel of waves in a shallow ocean or active systems in the presence of odd\nviscosity, as well as 2D electron gas with Hall viscosity. We use this\nopportunity to examine the case of large odd viscosity, where the scattering\nmatrix becomes $2\\times2$, which has not been discussed in previous works on\nthe Hermitian generalized BEC.\n</p>",
