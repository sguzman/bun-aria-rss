  "description": "<p>The Lost Books of the Bible! Is that really what we’re talking about today on Timesuck? Yes. Was I super excited to dive into this topic when I found out our Space Lizard listeners voted it in on the app? No! I mean, we just did an episode last week with a strong Christian theme! And now we’re doing another?</p>\n<p>Yep. And it's awesome.</p>\n<p>Turns out, once again, the wisdom of the Space Lizard community has surpassed my own. This is a great topic! A fascinating topic. A very hard topic to research - you guys kicked my ass on this one the week back from vacation, but a highly relevant and perpetually relevant topic! We take a pre-Catholic, pre-Great Protestant divide look into the very formation of Christianity itself. It's intense. Magic battles, a VERY strange sacrament ritual, entertaining archaic customs and so much more on today's Timesuck!</p>\n<p>Timesuck is brought to you by My West Coast Buds, the podcast! Take an inside look at cannabis, coffee, comedy, and spirits.</p>\n<p>Timesuck is also brought to you by American Addiction Centers. AAC is revolutionizing the addiction treatment industry with holistic, evidence-based treatment practices. Need help? Call American Addiction Centers at 888-708-4264 - available 24/7. Your life is worth more than your addiction. Don't wait until it's too late!</p>\n<p><strong>Merch </strong> <strong>- <a href=\"https://badmagicmerch.com/\">https://badmagicmerch.com/</a></strong></p>\n<p>Want to try out <strong>Discord!?! </strong><a href=\"https://discord.gg/tqzH89v\"><strong>https://discord.gg/tqzH89v</strong></a></p>\n<p>Want to join the Cult of the Curious private<strong> Facebook Group</strong>?
