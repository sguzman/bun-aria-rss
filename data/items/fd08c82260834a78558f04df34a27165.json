  "description": "<p>Welcome back coffee beans! This week, we're reunited with our good friend Carly and her boyfriend Nolie. Unlike our podcast, this wholesome couple really has their s*** together and we are over the moon for them! (If that's even possible...) Hear our thoughts on the suspicious moon landing, the paranormal world, and AL!3NS. Do you think aliens exist? They sure do in Carly and Mariah's eyes. The 2 go head to head....face to face if you will...to see who recognizes THESE popular celebs. (the results will shock you) So pour yourself a glass of wine, and get a good laugh in today!</p>\n",
