  "description": "<p>Are you hesitant to identify as a feminist? Conversely, do you struggle to understand why any woman WOULDN’T want to identify as a feminist? Cultural messaging around what feminism means is so pervasive that even proud feminists often have to shed cultural narratives that feminists are angry, humorless man-haters. When you look at the history of feminism through an intersectional lens, it becomes even clearer why some women - especially BIPOC women - may not identify with the movement.</p> <p> </p> <p>In this episode, I am joined by four of my Advanced Certification in Feminist Coaching (ACFC) graduates to discuss their discomfort with the label prior to joining the certification, and how ACFC changed their relationship to feminism. Whether you strongly identify as a feminist, or you’re unsure about whether you want to be one and what that even means, this episode will help you understand your own blind spots around why other people may not relate to this movement as you do.</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p>Get full show notes and more information here: <a href= \"https://unfuckyourbrain.com/205\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">https://unfuckyourbrain.com/205</a></p>",
