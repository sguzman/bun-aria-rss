  "description": "This week we look at how the size of a distiller will put a focus on their core name brand vs creating extensions. We talk a little bit about what you can and can’t patent in the whiskey business. Next, we examine the new Old Forester 150th anniversary and our thoughts on whether you would rather see single barrel cask strength releases or create a wide release. Lastly, we cover what has gone right and what’s been done wrong with limited edition releases that have happened in person and online.\nShow Notes:\n\nThis week’s Above the Char with Fred Minnick talks about how sometimes ignorance is bliss.\n\nOrange juice, pulp or no pulp?\n\nWhy don't new Distillers/Bottlers differentiate their products more? For instance, Barrell Bourbon, Barrell Rye, Barrell Rum, Pinhook Rye, Pinhook Bourbon, Pinhook Cask Strength. Whereas Buffalo Trace, Eagle Rare, Sazerac Rye, etc.\n\nWhat can and can't be patented in the whiskey business?\n\nOld Forester drops 3 batches of cask strength at $150 per bottle. Before I saw the price, I thought it was going to be a competitor to ECBP or Bookers. Would you rather see wide releases at barrel proof or barrel selections at barrel proof? You can't choose both.\n\nAngel's Envy Mizunara Cask, Old Forester Birthday Bourbon, Four Roses LE Releases. What has been done right and what went wrong?",
