  "description": "Robert Whitehead of London, a self-described “Business Man” who was “no Churchman and not a Jesus worshipper, much as I admire him,” wrote to Robert Eisler on New Year’s Eve of 1929, asking “if it is a frequent occurrence that men see The Christ; and are there occasions known when the visions are free from religiosity and at the same time full of life and power?” These questions came in light of Whitehead’s dramatic experience when he had seen a blazing vision of Christ in his home. In letters between the two men over the next few years, Eisler gave a startling psychoanalytic interpretation of the dream, which he eventually published. In this episode, I talk about Eisler’s only known attempt to psychoanalyze anyone else with psychoanalyst and religion scholar Marsha Hewitt.\nGuest: Marsha Hewitt (Trinity College, University of Toronto)\nVoice of Robert Eisler: Logan Crum\nAdditional voices: Logan Marshall\nMusic: “Shibbolet Baseda,” recorded by Elyakum Shapirra and His Israeli Orchestra.\nFunding provided by the Ohio University Humanities Research Fund and the Ohio University Honors Tutorial College Internship Program.\nSpecial thanks to the Warburg Institute.\nBibliography and Further Reading\nEisler, Robert.
