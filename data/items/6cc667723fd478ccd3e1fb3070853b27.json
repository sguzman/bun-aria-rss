  "description": "\"This was a horrible one-sided deal that should have never, ever been made,\" said President Trump as he pulled the US out of the Iran nuclear deal. \"It didn't bring calm, it didn't bring peace, and it never will.\" So what now for Iran, for the stability of the Middle East, and for future nuclear deals? So far Iran's President Rouhani has reacted cautiously but will the country's hardliners force him to resume enriching uranium, paving the way for a nuclear weapon? How will Iran's regional rivals Israel and Saudi Arabia react? Can the European Union, Russia, and China still keep Iran within the deal? And if they can't, what will the effect be on the outcome of any future nuclear deals. That's The Real Story with James Coomarasamy this week.",
