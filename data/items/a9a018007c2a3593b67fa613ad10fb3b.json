  "description": "Jaak Panksepp has identified 7 universal, cross-species circuits of emotion that can be located deep within the brain reliably in primates with neocortex functioning – besides humans, this includes rats, mice, guinea pigs, cats and of course larger primates. These networks are not up in the higher cortex, so they don’t involve rational thought, they are in the hypothalamus and amygdala, the more basic security system of the mind.\nThe 7 Basic Circuits of Emotion:\nSEEKING, PLAY, LUST, CARE – reward circuits\n\nFEAR, PANIC/LOSS, RAGE – punishing circuits, most animals want to avoid these emotional reactions\nWhy This Matters in Relationships\nEach circuit was discussed and the interaction of one circuit being activated turning on corresponding circuits of emotion in the other was highlighted. For example distress signals are activated when one is separated from their pack (PANIC/LOSS) turns on the CARE network, drawing others to them in with intent to protect and nurture. RAGE however, and this includes indignation and anger in humans, turns on the same circuit – anger begets anger.\nWhat You Can Do\nSo for those wanting to be closer in their relationships, it is advised to get VULNERABLE, show your distress, feel your needs and you will get the love you are looking for naturally. However get angry about not getting attention and you will get defensiveness and blame. So manipulate your close relationships into nurturing you by squeaking and expressing genuine vulnerability, they won’t be able to resist coming toward you with their hearts open.\n\nGet right with your squeak!! It’s in our most basic instincts and this works powerfully!\n\nJoin our email list at www.therapistuncensored.com to access our private online community supporting the dissemination of the relational sciences to support healthy connections and relationships around the world!\n\n \nRESOURCES:\nAdditional resources for this episode:\n\n \n\n \tJaak Panksepp – Affective Neuroscience Foundation of Emotions in Humans and Animals\n \tLouis Cozolino – Why Therapy Works Using our Minds to Change our Brains\n \tJoseph Ledoux – Anxious: Using the Brain to Understand and Treat Anxiety\n \tDan Siegel – The Mindful Brain Reflections on Attunement and the Culture of Well-being\n \tThese and other resources have been collected for you on our Resources page!",
