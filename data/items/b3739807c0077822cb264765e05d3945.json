  "description": "We have a major announcement: After lots of hard work and support from some incredible investors, our Curzio Equity Owners (CEO) token will start free-trading on the MERJ Exchange tomorrow.   Based on our research, this makes Curzio Research the first U.S.-based company to launch a digital security on a global exchange that can be traded by retail investors. MERJ is one of the fastest-growing exchanges in the world. But don’t take my word for it. Jim Needham, head of digital asset strategy at MERJ Exchange, breaks down the incredible growth of his exchange—and how U.S. investors can trade our CEO token  Jim also shares the backstory of launching the exchange… and how U.S. investors can gain access to every security trading on MERJ. [30:07]  Daniel Creech joins me to discuss the election—and who we think will emerge victorious (hint: we don’t agree). We also break down the new regulations coming for social media companies… and the real reason stocks are selling off hard into the election.
