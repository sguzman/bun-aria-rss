  "description": "The QAnon conspiracy theory originated in 2017, when an anonymous online figure, \"Q\" started posting on right-wing message boards. Q claims to have top secret government clearance. Q's stories range from false notions about COVID-19 to a cabal running the U.S. government to the claim there's a secret world of satanic pedophiles. This culminates in the belief that President Trump is a kind of savior figure.<br/><br/>Today, U.S. authorities are increasingly regarding QAnon as a domestic terror threat — especially following last week's insurrection at the Capitol. But the people in the best position to address that threat are the families of Q followers — and they're at a loss about how to do it.<br/><br/>Some of those family members spoke with us about how their family members started following QAnon and how that has affected their relationships. <br/><br/><a href=\"https://www.washingtonpost.com/people/travis-view/\">Travis View</a> researches right-wing conspiracies and hosts the podcast<a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/qanon-anonymous/id1428209307\"> QAnon Anonymous.</a> He explains how the QAnon story is not all that different from digital marketing tactics, and how followers become detached from reality.<br/><br/><a href=\"https://www.udel.edu/faculty-staff/experts/dannagal-young/\">Dannagal Young</a> is an associate professor of communications at the University of Delaware and studies why people latch onto political conspiracy theories.
