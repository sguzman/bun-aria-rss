  "description": "The Federal Reserve wraps up its March meeting today and Chair Jerome Powell is expected to announce the first interest rate hike since 2018. Daniel gives his take on how the Fed should move forward from here… and why the volatility in oil gives the Fed some wiggle room. [0:30] The Fed is so far behind the curve on fighting inflation, it’s a joke at this point… And if it doesn’t take a certain set of actions… we’ll end up seeing 10% inflation this year—or higher. [4:00] Next, we dive into an ethical question: Is it wrong to invest in Russia right now? [10:38] Turning to cryptocurrencies... Daniel and I debate the usefulness of President Biden’s broad executive order calling for further analysis of the industry. (I believe it’s a game-changer…) [20:48] Finally, movie theater company AMC recently made headlines by investing in a gold and silver mining company. As crazy as it might sound, I explain why this isn’t a bad move. [34:49] Enjoyed this episode?
