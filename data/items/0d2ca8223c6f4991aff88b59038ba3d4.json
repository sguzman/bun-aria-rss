However, the left teaches that we are to hate our founding, the NY Times lies and says that the country was founded in 1619 on the basis of slavery. We now have a major political party, the Democrats, that have as their purpose to fundamentally transform America by ignoring and eliminating the Bill of Rights and our founding overall. Their latest quest is to abandon the Second Amendment in the name of compassion, but destroying our liberties is not the answer. Increasing punishment for violent criminals illegally using guns might be a start. Then, choosing to live in hurricane-prone areas is your responsibility, not the state, or federal government's. Joe Bastardi calls in to give us the latest update on Hurricane Dorian. Later, Debra Messing wants to blacklist actors supporting President Trump's Beverly Hills fundraiser. Afterward, an update on the wounded Police officer that confronted and stopped the Odessa Texas shooter.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
