Each week, Slate’s scholars of experimental theology Dan Kois and Laura Miller discuss the HBO series and Philip Pullman’s original trilogy. It’s a new season, and Lyra and Will aren’t the only people who’ve traveled to entirely different worlds. We all have since the show’s first season ended in 2019. Can Season 2 recapture the magic? We explore the season premiere, “The City of Magpies,” and discuss the architecture of Citàgazze, the growing friendship between Lyra and Will, and the secret powers of witches.\nEmail: asktheauthority@slate.com\nPodcast production by Phil Surkis.\n\nDan Kois on Twitter: @dankois\nLaura Miller on Twitter: @magiciansbook\nLearn more about your ad choices.
