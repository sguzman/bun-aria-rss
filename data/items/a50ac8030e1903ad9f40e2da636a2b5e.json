  "description": "It's Episode 21 AND today is World Down Syndrome Day! We couldn't be more excited to highlight Seth, Sunflower, Macyn, and August, our child and guest's children with Down Syndrome, who face a world where they are told that they are not welcome.  We are joined by Heather and Josh Avis, Mercedes Lara, and Justina Erre where we get to share a little about raising children with Down Syndrome and how we'd like to flip the cultural narrative.
