  "description": "<p>On today's show, the guys sit back and remember some of the great moments of the show as they reach the 100th episode (just kidding, no one knew this until after the fact.) The guys do, however, chat about Connor considering making a few chicken pot pie's for Thanksgiving, Zito still battling through gout, and they dive into a loaded Pod FOD that includes questions about Soytiet charging 6000 USD for a business post on his Instagram, a grandmother being artificially inseminated so her daughter could have a baby, Big Motor faces the music and finally comes to the realization that he is in fact a cheapskate, when Thanksgiving is in Canada, Mitt selling shoes on the secondary market and being a scumbag about it, plus much more. Don't forget to send in your submissions to the Pod FOD @ThePodPMI on Twitter and Instagram, and subscribe to youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow to join McAfee's Mafia and watch episodes of The Pod on youtube. We appreciate you all for listening, stay safe out there, and enjoy.</p>\n",
