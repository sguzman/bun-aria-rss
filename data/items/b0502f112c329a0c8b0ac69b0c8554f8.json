  "description": "AWS (Amazon Web Services) certifications are among the most lucrative certifications in the IT sector. This is due to the growing demand for professionals with cloud expertise, as more and more companies are adopting cloud technology. Furthermore, AWS upholds high quality standards when it comes to certification. So, while certification can be challenging, there is a lot to learn along the way.\nI only recently had my first exposure to cloud computing when I took on a DevOps role in industry in 2019."
