  "description": "<p>Regarding the duality of the XY-placket model in the $2+1d$ system, We\ncompared and discussed the equivalence and difference between the modified\nVillain formulation, recently introduced by Gorantla et al. to study duality in\nexotic field theories such as fracton theory, and the standard Villain\nformulation and dual Hamiltonian method we introduced in our previous paper to\nstudy duality between Josephson junctions and quantum phase slips in the $1+1d$\nsystem.\n</p>",
