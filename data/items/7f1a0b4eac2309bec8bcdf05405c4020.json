  "description": "“You are placed in a position where you have the power to save or destroy us; to bless or blast us--I mean our whole race.”\nThis is the story of the first US Presidency to end in impeachment. This is the story of Andrew Johnson.\nThe post-Civil War government of the United States faces difficult decisions. Should it be lenient to former Confederate states? Or should it take a hard hand? Should the Federal government play a role in reconstructing state governments (Reconstruction)? Or should it leave the states to their own devices? Slavery’s over, but does that mean black Americans are equal citizens with white Americans? Or can states enact laws, called “Black Codes,” that only apply to its black residents? Can states deny them the vote?\nThese are the questions facing VP-turned-President Andrew Johnson, and he doesn’t seem to agree with Congress on much. Can Congress impeach and convict him for firing War Secretary Edwin Stanton? Or will the case fall apart? We’ll find out. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
