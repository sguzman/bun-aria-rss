  "description": "India Walton won the Democratic primary for Mayor of Buffalo, New York, in June. Her victory put her on track to become the first socialist mayor in the city’s history, and the first nationwide in more than half a century. The only problem is, her opponent - current mayor Byron Brown - refuses to bow out, and is waging a well-funded write-in campaign in the hopes of keeping his post.\n\nHow has a self-styled socialist gotten so close to running Buffalo? And why are some Democrats standing in her way?\n\nGuest: Ross Barkan, a contributing writer to The Nation and the author of The Prince: Andrew Cuomo, Coronavirus, and the Fall of New York.\n\nIf you enjoy this show, please consider signing up for Slate Plus.
