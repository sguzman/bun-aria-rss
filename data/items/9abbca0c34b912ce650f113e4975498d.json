  "description": "<p>The book of Mark gives us insight into the authentic Jesus—not the Jesus who is a projection of our own desires. In this passage, we will 1) See that there are wrong theories about who Jesus is; 2) Hear from Jesus’s own lips who he really is; and 3) Learn what difference that makes for us in our lives. </p>\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on March 5, 2006. Series: King's Cross: The Gospel of Mark, Part 1: The Coming of the King. Scripture: Mark 3:20-35.</p>\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.
