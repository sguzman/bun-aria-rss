  "description": "<p>John Dillinger. J Edgar Hoover named him America's public enemy #1 for a reason. Dude LOVED to rob a bank. John lived and robbed during arguably the best time to be a gangster in America's history. Pretty Boy Floyd, Baby Face Nelson, Bonnie and Clyde, Machine Gun Kelly - America was full of people not afraid to walk into a bank with a gun and demand some money. And if the cops showed up, they weren't laying down their guns. It seemed like everyone was robbing banks in the early 1930s. Why? Partially, because of the Great Depression. Partially because of different laws and a different level of law enforcement. It was easier to rob banks back then, easier to take on the cops, and easier to get out of prison if you got caught. Sticks ups, prison breakouts, and more explored in this action-packed edition of Timesuck. Take your mind off your troubles for a few hours and enjoy this free content! <br /><br />Andrew Welmers Mental Health COTC FB Group: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/512302776280743/?ref=share\"><strong>https://www.facebook.com/groups/512302776280743/?ref=share</strong></a></p>\n<p>Beefsteak GoFundMe campaign: <a href=\"https://www.gofundme.com/f/beefsteak039s-leg-fund?utm_source=customer&utm_medium=copy_link-tip&utm_campaign=p_cp+share-sheet\"><strong>https://www.gofundme.com/f/beefsteak039s-leg-fund?utm_source=customer&utm_medium=copy_link-tip&utm_campaign=p_cp+share-sheet</strong></a></p>\n<p>Watch my Amazon special Don't Wake the Bear: <strong><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Dan-Cummins-Dont-Wake-Bear/dp/B07L6QSLTY/ref=sr_1_3?keywords=don%27t+wake+the+bear&qid=1584979701&s=digital-text&sr=1-3-catcorr\">CLICK HERE</a></strong></p>\n<p>We've donated $4800 this month to The Martin Richard Foundation. <br />Link to donate: <strong><a href=\"https://teammr8.org/\">https://teammr8.org/ </a></strong>Donate via Timesucker Matt Cox: <strong><a href=\"https://charity.gofundme.com/o/en/campaign/mr8bos20/matthewcox1\">https://charity.gofundme.com/o/en/campaign/mr8bos20/matthewcox1</a></strong><br /><strong><br /></strong><a href=\"https://www.timtebowfoundation.org/night-to-shine-host-information\"><strong></strong></a><strong>2020 Toxic Thoughts Tour</strong> <strong>Is Currently On HOLD due to the COVID-19 Pandemic. <br /></strong><strong>Listen to the best of my standup on Spotify!</strong> (for free!) <a href=\"https://spoti.fi/2Dyy41d\"><strong>https://spoti.fi/2Dyy41d</strong></a></p>\n<p><strong>Watch the Suck on YouTube: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/sGyMBWDWGk0\">https://youtu.be/sGyMBWDWGk0</a><br /><br />M</strong><strong>erch </strong> <strong>- <a href=\"https://badmagicmerch.com/\">https://badmagicmerch.com/</a></strong></p>\n<p>Want to try out <strong>Discord!?! </strong><a href=\"https://discord.gg/tqzH89v\"><strong>https://discord.gg/tqzH89v</strong></a></p>\n<p>Want to join the Cult of the Curious private<strong> Facebook Group</strong>?
