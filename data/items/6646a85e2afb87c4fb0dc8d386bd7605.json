  "description": "At this point, it is hard to fathom the shear volume of studies of American slavery that scholars have produced. And new works on American slavery are being published at a remarkable clip. As a result, writing a new synthesis of this scholarship is a monumental feat.  Dr. Calvin Schermerhorn, however, has taken done the job, and wonderfully. His new book Unrequited Toil: A History of United States Slavery (Cambridge University Press, 2018) weaves the history of slavery into that of the United States from the founding of the nation to the Reconstruction era.\nAdam McNeil is PhD student in History at the University of Delaware where he is an African American Public Humanities Initiative and Colored Conventions Project Scholar. He received his M.A. in History at Simmons College in 2018 and his B.S. in History at Florida Agricultural and Mechanical University in 2015.
