Preparing to go onstage in Boston on her birthday 6 months later, Marga gets a text from Hortensia that reads ‘hope you’re doing something fun’. I’ll show you FUN… feeling as though the world has stopped loving her, Marga experiences kindness from a stranger and wonders “after all those dreams, is it finally time for the blowjob experience?” & more importantly, do your skills translate to men if you’re (notoriously) really good at oral? #Monogamous #Queer #Ethnic #Age #Geography #StillComing</strong></p> <p class=\"p2\"> </p> <p class=\"p1\"><strong><em>About the storyteller:</em></strong></p> <p class=\"p2\"> </p> <p class=\"p3\"><strong>Marga Gomez (she, her, they, hey) is the creator of the channel “Latina Stream Queens” on YouTube.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span> She is also a nationally recognized playwright, actor and comedian born in New York’s Harlem, raised in Washington Heights and based in San Francisco.
