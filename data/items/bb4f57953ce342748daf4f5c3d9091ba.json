  "description": "Kris joins the podcast to discuss the From Growth to Value research service featuring the Potential Multibaggers.\nAs the name suggests, Kris's research looks at both growth and value, but these lines often blur. The importance for investors is not so much labels but finding a style that one is comfortable with.\n\"I was actually more of a value investor at first but I found that it didn't fit my personality,\" he says. \"My strategy is actually based on optimism.\" People get distracted by bad news and by \"everything that could go wrong.\"\nThus the focus on the winners, and finding the \"multibagger\" that can produce outsized returns over the long term. \"If you have even one multibagger in your portfolio, then your portfolio is going to do a lot better than any benchmark.\"\nIt starts with focusing on the good things, on companies that can grow very quickly. Right now the principle of \"unscaling,\" where services become more individualized, is an emerging trend. This can be seen with a company like Shopify (SHOP), Trade Desk (TTD), or Square (SQ) but also with clothing retailers and drugmakers. \nTopics Covered\n\n2:15 minute mark - What's your investing strategy?\n\n10:00 - What's your process for narrowing down the choices?\n\n12:30 - Background as an investor and how you started doing this.\n\n14:30 - Anything learned over the past year?\n\n17:45 - What is something that concerns you about the markets?\n\n20:15 - What are you most excited about right now?\n\n25:30 - Other companies besides SHOP that are \"unscaling\".\n\n27:45 - Favorite ideas.",
