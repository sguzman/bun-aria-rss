  "description": "Contributor(s): Amy Mollett, David Kohn, Fran Tonkiss, Hyun Bang Shin | In this podcast we set out to explore how design and architecture can enhance and manipulate our everyday experiences. Architect David Kohn, co-designer of A Room for London, discusses how design can influence the way we experience everything from time to the urban experience. Fran Tonkiss, LSE Reader in Sociology and Director of the LSE Cities Programme, talks about her latest book on the social life of urban form and why ‘the devil gets all the best designs’. Hyun Bang Shin, LSE Associate Professor in Geography and Urban Studies, talks about reading Marx under South Korea’s strict national security laws and how this has influenced his own work on urban displacement. Presented by Amy Mollett. Produced by Cheryl Brumley. Other Contributors: David Kohn, Fran Tonkiss, Hyun Bang Shin.
