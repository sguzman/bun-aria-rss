  "description": "<p>How has your relationship with your sensuality and sexuality been this quarantine? For many of us, not great. Our bodies have been stressed out, hence disconnected from our sensual essence. In this episode, we’re going to bring it back.</p> <p>I sit with sexuality expert Dr. Saida Desilets to discuss why your desires are not only not a bad thing but actually SACRED. We speak about redefining the word “holy,” communicating your sexual needs + preferences with your partner, the misunderstanding that Buddhism is all about dropping your desires and how your desires are actually pointing you to your highest spiritual embodiment.
