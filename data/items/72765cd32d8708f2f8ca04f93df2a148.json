  "description": "Hey HBs! It's part 2 of In the Company of Women by Kate Christie! We get more WW2 Women's Army Corps goodness and an HEA! Plus, 1994 classic Nell, dumb inspirational posters, and more! \n Lady Loves: \n Erin: Tazo Dessert Tea in Lemon Loaf\n Melody: exfoliate your whole body and the amazon playlist \"music of the 2000s\"\n Patreon Shout Out: \n Meredith H, you are descended from Marzanna, the polish goddess of Winter. I think of her as an old-timey Elsa. She’s often depicted while sewing, but I like to think of that as old-timey knitting. She’s a real opposites attract kind of gal, as she was the consort of Dazbog, the sun god. I think that just like you, Marzanna brought people together. She created the icy weather that brought families to their hearths to knit and play boardgames. She increased the hours with which people could spend quality time with those they love most, at home, or at their favorite yarn store. Plus, she’s powerful enough to create ice monsters and build ice fortresses, yet wise enough to overcome her self-loathing and fears to flourish in her family’s love. To hone her abilities and own her power. So you keep organizing your people to spend quality time and create change, whether it’s in the icy season, or when your modern Dazbog is inviting everyone outside. \n Podcast Shout Out:  A Healthy Curiosity\nMentioned in this episode:\nPreorder Naima Simone X Friends Book Boyfriend Box!!\nThis box has EVERYTHING you could ever want in a book boyfriend from Tessa Bailey, Avery Flynn, Farrah Rochon, Jayci Lee, Kennedy Ryan, Adriana Herrera, and Naima Simone.\nYou can look forward to paperbacks, signed book plates, limited edition book boyfriend mugs, the book boyfriend pajamas/loungewear, bookmarks and more!\nTiers include:\n- Cinnamon Roll - $114.99\n- The Alpha - - $169.99 \nEnter the promo code BONKERS10 at checkout to receive $10 off!!! \nONLY AVAILABLE UNTIL OCT 10, 2022!\nIf you have any questions, email orders@honeymagnolia.co.\nhttps://heaving-bosoms.captivate.fm/nsbookboyfriends (Naima's Book Boyfriends)",
