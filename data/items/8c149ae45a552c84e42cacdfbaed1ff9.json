  "description": "<p>How much time should we spend thinking versus painting? Are we wasting time if we simply sit in a chair and look at what we made? And how can we approach analysing our own work? In this episode, we discuss the importance of spending time with our work at various stages - including setting intentions, assessing progress during the making of the work, and reflecting on paintings once they are complete. Time pressures, and a focus on productivity, can make it challenging for some artists to take a pause, but we both agree that it's important to step back and find some distance from our work - whether that is halfway through a painting or once a series is complete. In fact, we think that pause improves our productivity because it allows us to clarify our thoughts and set clear intentions for our next moves.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>Talking Heads \"Stop Making Sense\" on Youtube: <a href=\"\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=JjBvRURtc-Q</a></p>\n<p>Find our websites and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.alicesheridan.com&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p>@alicesheridanstudio</p>\n<p>@louisefletcher_art</p>\n<p>Credits: \"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n",
