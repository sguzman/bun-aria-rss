  "description": "<p>As spiritual beings, we cannot bypass what is going on in the world around us. In this episode, I discuss the history of racism in this country and how it affects the world we live in today. I discuss how us ignoring what is happening in the world today is often because we feel guilt/confusion, therefore deflect and how to acknowledge anger within and in society.</p> <p>I share my personal racism journey and why it’s important we aren’t afraid of confronting this huge topic -- it’s necessary to move forward in the new paradigm.</p> <p>Being part of a conscious online community is more important than ever before. Leave your anxiety behind and get the support, connection and inspiration your soul has been craving in Rose Gold Goddesses, the sacred sisterhood all about becoming your highest self.
