  "description": "<p>Scorpions: the victims of undue shade. If you've ever wanted to impress a date with weird facts THIS IS THE EPISODE FOR YOU. A handful of people on planet Earth have a PhD in scorpions and Dr. Lauren Esposito is one of them. She spills the beans on how venom works, what's up with the blacklight glow effect, how dangerous they *really* are, what all the movies get wrong, the best names for scorpions, where she's traveled to look under rocks, where a scorpion's butt is, if scorpions dance or make out (SPOILER: YES), what good mothers they are, how big they used to be millions of years ago and how -- technically speaking -- they are not poisonous. Also: how much does a gallon of venom cost? Oh, and why she started the visibility campaign 500 Queer Scientists. Get this one in your ears right away. </p><p>Follow Dr. Esposito at <a href=\"http://twitter.com/arachnologynerd\" target=\"_blank\">twitter.com/arachnologynerd</a> or <a href=\"http://instagram.com/caribales\" target=\"_blank\">instagram.com/caribales</a> and check out</p><p><a href=\"http://500QueerScientists.com\" target=\"_blank\">500QueerScientists.com</a></p><p>Sponsor links: <a href=\"http://Calm.com/Ologies\" target=\"_blank\">Calm.com/Ologies</a>, <a href=\"http://KiwiCo.com/Ologies\" target=\"_blank\">KiwiCo.com/Ologies</a>, <a href=\"http://LinkedIn.com/Ologies\" target=\"_blank\">LinkedIn.com/Ologies</a></p><p>This week's donation went to: <a href=\"http://www.Islandsseas.org\" target=\"_blank\">www.Islandsseas.org</a></p><p>More links at <a href=\"http://alieward.com/ologies/scorpiology\" target=\"_blank\">alieward.com/ologies/scorpiology</a></p><p>Become a patron of Ologies for as little as a buck a month: <a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/ologies\" target=\"_blank\">www.Patreon.com/ologies</a></p><p><a href=\"http://ologiesmerch.com/\" target=\"_blank\">OlogiesMerch.com</a> has hats, shirts, pins, totes!</p><p>Follow <a href=\"http://twitter.com/ologies\" target=\"_blank\">twitter.com/ologies</a> or <a href=\"http://instagram.com/ologies\" target=\"_blank\">instagram.com/ologies</a></p><p>Follow <a href=\"http://twitter.com/AlieWard\" target=\"_blank\">twitter.com/AlieWard</a> or <a href=\"http://instagram.com/AlieWard\" target=\"_blank\">instagram.com/AlieWard</a></p><p>Sound editing by <a href=\"http://instagram.com/Jarrett_Sleeper\" target=\"_blank\">Jarrett Sleeper</a> of <a href=\"http://www.mindjammedia.com/\" target=\"_blank\">MindJam Media</a> & <a href=\"https://twitter.com/stevenRayMorris\" target=\"_blank\">Steven Ray Morris</a></p><p>Theme song by Nick Thorburn</p><p><a href=\"http://Patreon.com/ologies\">Support the show: http://Patreon.com/ologies</a></p>\n",
