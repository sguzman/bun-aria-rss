  "description": "<p>In this episode, John explains why although he sympathizes with Josh Rosen being drafted into a bad spot in Arizona, he deserves blame for failing in Miami, why Belichick deserves credit for his \"buy low\" acquisition of Cam Newton, and if a rookie celebrity coach - like Steve Nash with the Nets - could work in the NFL. He also answers listener questions in the Middlekauff Mailbag.
