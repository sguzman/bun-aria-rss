  "description": "When I started working in the IT sector, I was impressed by the large number of different roles that exist and it took me quite a bit of time to understand their individual responsibilities. That is why I thought it would be nice to share my understanding of the most common roles you will encounter in IT projects.\nYou should definitely read this post if you are thinking about applying for position in the information technology sector but are unsure which one is the right fit for you or if youâ€™re already working in IT and want to improve your understanding of other roles."
