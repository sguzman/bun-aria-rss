  "description": "<p>So much love for anyone who decides to intern with us at VaynerMedia. Means the absolute world to me and there's nothing better than seeing those same interns come work for us full-time when they're ready. This is a talk I gave to this past summer's interns at VM. Such a great discussion and I made sure I did my best to be as open and honest to them about how to approach their time here and the years to follow. For anyone in their position or know people that might be, I suggest you take a listen. Nothing fluffy here ;)</p><img src=\"http://feedpress.me/9857/4996044.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>",
