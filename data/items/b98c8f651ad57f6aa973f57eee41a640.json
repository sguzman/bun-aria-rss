  "description": "MicroStrategy’s Michael Saylor thinks Bitcoin will reach $500K - $1,000,000 per coin in the next years if it matches the market capitalization of gold.\n\n“The next logical step for bitcoin is to replace gold as a non-sovereign store of value asset.”\n\nLast year, he outlined the merits of the king crypto (BTC) and claimed that it is 50 times better than the precious metal. This summer, he doubled down on that stance, saying the asset is “obviously better than gold and everything that gold wants to be.”\n\nInstead of going to zero (as some might predict given its recent price decline), Saylor envisioned it will shoot up to $1 million in the years to come.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
