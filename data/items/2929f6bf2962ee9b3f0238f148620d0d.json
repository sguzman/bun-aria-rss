  "title": "Week 8 Recap, Seahawks/Texans Game Of The Year? (Football 10/30)",
  "description": "Nick Kostos, Pete Prisco and Jason La Canfora recap everything from across the NFL in Week 8, including potentially the game of the year as the Seahawks and Texans traded blows in a back-and-forth affair, the Cowboys division win over the Redskins, the Patriots improving to 6-2, and some seemingly legitimate competition in the AFC East as the Bills keep winning. The guys then address if the Eagles are the best team in the NFL, if the Saints are the best in the NFC South, and if Dirk Koetter's job could be in jeopardy in Tampa Bay. Nick, Pete and Jason discuss the Falcons escaping New York with a victory over the Jets, Case Keenum's performance in London as the Vikings defeated the Browns, and the Bengals one-point win over the Colts.\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
