  "description": "In today's podcast, we hear that Spain sees foreign influence operations in Catalonia. IBM's X-Force warns of a new banking Trojan. There may be a mole hunt going on in NSA—and somewhere the Shadow Brokers are smiling. Anti-virus companies fix the AVGater vulnerability. Firefox and Google both commit to security upgrades. Johannes Ullrich from SANS Technology Institute and the ISC Stormcast podcast on the challenges of random number generation. Steve McGregory from Ixia on the challenges of dealing with the virtually infinite computing power and bandwidth of cloud computing. Tenable urges people to avoid breaches through good hygiene, and Carbon Black wishes we'd stop calling attackers \"hackers.\" \n Thanks for listening to the CyberWire. One of the ways you can support what we do is by visiting our sponsors. We read Recorded Future’s free intel daily, you might find it valuable, too.\n Cylance is revolutionizing cybersecurity with products and services that proactively prevent, rather than reactively detect the execution of advanced persistent threats and malware.
