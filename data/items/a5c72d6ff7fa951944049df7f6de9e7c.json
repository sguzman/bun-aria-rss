  "description": "<p>Davidson County, North Carolina. August 2nd, 2015. Molly Martens and her father, Tom Martens, killed Jason Corbett, Molly’s Irish Husband, in what they claim was an act of self-defense. Tom, and his wife Sharon, had stayed over at Molly & Jason's house that night, awoke to shouting and a scuffle upstairs. He grabbed an aluminum little league baseball bat that he had purchased for his grandson, Jack, and made his way upstairs to the source of the noise; Molly and Jason’s bedroom. There he claims he found Jason Corbett strangling Molly. A scuffle ensued that left Jason Corbett dead and naked on the floor of his bedroom with a caved in skull. Was this self-defense? Or was there another reason for them to kill Jason?</p><p>Get bonus content from Generation Why at:&nbsp;<a href=\"http://patreon.com/generationwhy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">patreon.com/generationwhy</a></p><p>Listen ad free with Wondery+.
