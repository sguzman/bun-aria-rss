  "description": "It's been five years since Björk last released an album, but now the Icelandic icon is back with a deeply inventive set called <em>Fossora</em>. Every sound on the record feels as if it's springing into the mix from a different direction, as her vibrant voice shares space with everything from bass clarinets to the voices of Björk's own offspring. <em>Fossora</em> was inspired, at least in part, by the death of the singer's mother, but joy also abounds. <br/><br/>We've also got the star-packed major-label debut of veteran rapper Freddie Gibbs, a reinvention for the long-running jazz group The Bad Plus, the return of U.K. pop star Craig David and a wild electro-pop record from Shygirl. <br/><br/><strong>Featured Albums: <br/><br/></strong>1.
