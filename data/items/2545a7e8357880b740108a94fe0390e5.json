We’re talking the babies and the pregnancies—and why they are such a juggernaut in romance. We’re talking about why people are all in on secret babies or absolutely all out on them, we’re pinpointing the itch they scratch and why have they installed such buttons in so many of us, and we’re getting to the bottom to why these secret babies are often sired by billionaires. It’s a ride.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Next week, our first read along is Amanda Quick’s <em>Ravished</em>—which Sarah describes as “Harriet, in a cave, with a rake.” It’s great.

Secret pregnancy is just earlier on the timeline, while surprise pregnancy. Often, a secret baby plot happens because there is a fear that the baby is in danger.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">More about the word&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.merriam-webster.com/dictionary/interstitial\">Interstitial</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">We recently re-released our&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2021/9/6/bonus-rerelease-of-bodily-autonomy-interstitial\">bodily autonomy interstitial</a>&nbsp;from 2019.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">If you are on Facebook, join Sarah’s&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/groups/osrbc/\">OSCRB group (Old School Romance Book Club</a>) if you want more romance talk.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">On some old school covers, you see lots of people with&nbsp;<a href=\"https://i.pinimg.com/originals/67/73/17/6773176bf05b1d9485f623b285341ca4.jpg\">gravity defying hair.&nbsp;</a></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Sarah mentioned the “Four Js” and she meant these old school historical romance powerhouses:&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2019/10/7/s025-gentle-rogue\">Johanna Lindsay</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fatedmates.net/episodes/tag/Jude+deveraux\">Jude Deveraux</a>,&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2020/12/7/s0318-julie-garwood-interstitial\">Julie Garwood</a>, and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2020/6/9/s0240-a-kingdom-of-dreams\">Judith McNaught</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The most&nbsp;<a href=\"https://fatedmates.net/episodes/2021/8/1/s0351-mistresses-courtesans-and-cheating-in-romance-interstitial-with-adriana-herrera\">dangerous third rail in romance is cheating</a>.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">More about&nbsp;<a href=\"https://theconversation.com/prince-harry-and-the-history-of-the-heir-and-the-spare-96685\">“the heir and the spare.”</a></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><a href=\"https://www.wired.com/2014/11/oral-history-of-right-stuff/\">The Right Stuff</a>&nbsp;is a movie about astronauts, but&nbsp;<a href=\"https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/570210/terms-of-endearment-movie-facts\">Terms of Endearment</a>&nbsp;is the movie where Jack Nicholson plays an astronaut.
