They also discuss that doctor's realization that he fits a disturbing brain profile that he discovered accidentally while doing a controlled study. Later they turn to the phones and speak to a caller who has suffered from suicides around him and is wondering what's being done to address the issue. \n\nPlease Support Our Sponsors:\nJustWorks.com\nGeico.com\nPluto.TV",
