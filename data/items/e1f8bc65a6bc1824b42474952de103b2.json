  "description": "Fascination with The Titanic has not faded, though more than 105 years have passed since its tragic sinking when so many lives were lost, and an era of gilded glamor ended.  Culinary historian, Veronica Hinke’s new book, The Last Night on the Titanic: Unsinkable Drinking, Dining, and Style(Regnery History, 2019) is a celebration of the ethos of The Titanic, using the food and drink served on board as a fulcrum of a broader exploration of this fascinating episode of maritime history, the intriguing characters who sailed on her, and the enduring legacy of the world’s most famous Transatlantic crossing.\nHinke tells the stories of millionaires and pastry chefs, popcorn vendors, and perfume salesmen, all gathered aboard the gargantuan ship for its celebrated maiden voyage in 1912. Hinke’s meticulous research has captured not only the glamour of the First-Class dining room but also the harrowing moments as families are separated at the lifeboats.  From menus stuffed into jacket pockets, and the archives of Gilded Age restaurants such as Delmonico’s and the St. Regis, Hinke has put together authentic recipes for many of the dishes served on the Titanic as well as the cocktails mixed at its elegant bars.\nHinke’s passion for her material shines through this professionally researched, and thoroughly enjoyable exploration of Edwardian glamour and gastronomy on the high seas.\nVeronica Hinke is a culinary historian, food writer, and author.  She is the co-host of History Unplugged’s miniseries on The Titanic.  Find out more about Veronica by following her on Instagram, Twitter, and Facebook.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
