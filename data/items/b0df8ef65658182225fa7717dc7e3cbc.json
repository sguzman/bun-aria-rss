  "description": "<p>It’s time we stopped thinking about the way we eat only in terms of our health—we need to recognize the global impact of food. We need to eat in a way that combines good science with common sense. We need to not just include our health in the equation but also the biodiversity of the planet and our ability to grow food for future generations. So how do we do that? We’ve all been told we should go vegan to save the planet, but even if you don’t eat animals conventional agriculture kills 7 billion animals a year through habitat destruction. Not to mention, massive amounts of greenhouse gases are emitted to produce processed soy foods even if you completely avoid beef. Then people preach Paleo or keto but eat lots of factory-farmed meat, which also produces massive amounts of greenhouse gases, and is not something you want to put in your body.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Our food system is fundamentally flawed. That’s why I wrote my new book Food Fix that just hit shelves yesterday! To share all the solutions for creating a food system that helps both our bodies and the planet thrive. I’m really excited to tell you more about it. This week on <em>The Doctor’s Farmacy</em> we’re sharing part two of the conversation we started last week, with my good friend and business partner Dhru Purohit as the host. We dig into the problems that led me to write <em>Food Fix </em>and how we can all take action starting today.&nbsp;</p><br><p>This episode is brought to you by Joovv and ButcherBox.</p><br><p>I recently discovered Joovv, a red light therapy device. Red light therapy is a super gentle non-invasive treatment where a device with medical-grade LEDs delivers concentrated light to your skin. It actually helps your cells produce collagen so it improves skin tone and complexion, diminishes signs of aging like wrinkles, and speeds the healing of wounds and scars. To check out the Joovv products for yourself head over to <a href=\"https://joovv.com/farmacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">joovv.com/farmacy</a>.
