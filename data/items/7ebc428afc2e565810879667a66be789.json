  "description": "<p>We present a modification of the DGLAP improved saturation model with respect\nto the nonlinear correction (NLC). The GLR-MQ improved saturation model is\nconsidered by employing the parametrization of proton structure function due to\nthe Laplace transforms method, which preserves its behavior success in the low\nand high $Q^{2}$ regions. We show that the geometric scaling holds for the\nGLR-MQ improved model in a wide kinematic region $rQ_{s}$. These results are\ncomparable with other models in a wide kinematic region $rQ_{s}$. The behavior\nof the dipole cross sections, with respect to the GLR-MQ improved saturation\nmodel, are comparable with the Color Glass Condensate (CGC) model. The model\ndescribes the dipole cross sections in the inclusive and diffractive processes.\nWe also compare the nonlinear corrections to the impact-parameter dependent\nsaturation (IP-Sat) model with the impact-parameter dependent color glass\ncondensate (b-CGC) dipole model. Finally, we consider the linear and nonlinear\ncorrections to the IP Non-Sat model. These results provide a benchmark for\nfurther investigation of QCD at small $x$ in future experiments such as the\nLarge Hadron Collider and Future Circular Collider projects.\n</p>",
