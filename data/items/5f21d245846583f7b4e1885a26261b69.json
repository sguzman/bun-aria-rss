  "description": "<p>What does it feel like to have a breakthrough in your art? How do you know it’s actually a breakthrough and not just a fluke success? And how do you keep the momentum going once the initial serotonin rush has subsided and you realise there is a lot of work still to do? Last week Alice predicted that a breakthrough was on the way for Louise, and that turned out to be very prescient. In this episode she shares what happened, what she plans to do next and why power tools will play an important role. We also answer a listener question about whether it’s acceptable for a workshop leader to physically change a student’s work, sparking an interesting discussion about teaching styles and student boundaries.</p>\n<p><br>\nBooks Mentioned:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>No Night is Too Long - Barbara Vine <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Night-Too-Long-Barbara-Vine/dp/0517799642\">https://www.amazon.co.uk/Night-Too-Long-Barbara-Vine/dp/0517799642</a><br>\nMoon Tiger - Penelope Lively <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=moon+tiger&i=stripbooks&ref=nb_sb_noss_1\">https://www.amazon.co.uk/s?k=moon+tiger&i=stripbooks&ref=nb_sb_noss_1</a><br>\nThe Pilot’s Wife - Anita Shreve <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pilots-Wife-Anita-Shreve/dp/0349110859/ref=sr_1_1?dchild=1&keywords=The+Pilot%E2%80%99s+Wife+-+Anita+Shreve&qid=1596490318&s=books&sr=1-1\">https://www.amazon.co.uk/Pilots-Wife-Anita-Shreve/dp/0349110859</a><br>\nHow to Paint a Dead Man - Sarah Hall <a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Paint-Dead-Sarah-Hall/dp/0571315631/\">https://www.amazon.co.uk/How-Paint-Dead-Sarah-Hall/dp/0571315631/</a></p>\n<p>Find us and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\">bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</a></p>\n<p>Buy us a coffee at: <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\">https://ko-fi.com/artjuice</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p>Alice <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com@alicesheridanstudio/\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p>Louise <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p><em>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</em></p>\n",
