  "description": "We never like to rank crushes, but we finally decided to talk about the Hollywood Chrises: Chris Pine, Chris Hemsworth, and Chris Messina. (We think we've covered Chris Evans thoroughly enough in our season one finale so feel free to re-listen to that episode because we had to give the other fellas some love). Pine is just fine. Hemsworth makes us forget ourselves, and Messina... whew! Let us school you on why you have to stop overlooking that spark plug of a man. DASSIT. There are no more Chrises! However, Fanfic Wars is back! Did you miss the drabbles? We sure did. Stay tuned and stay thirsty, friends.\n<br>\nDo you need help figuring out your next crush? Drop us a line! Leave us a message at (765) 8-THIRST (765-884-4778) with your name and what kind of crush advice you're looking for, and maybe we'll answer your question in an upcoming Thirst Sommelier. \n<br>Follow us on Twitter @ThirstAidKit.
