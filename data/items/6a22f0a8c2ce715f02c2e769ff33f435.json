  "description": "Few decisions a government can make are more consequential than deciding when the use of force is warranted. In the US a debate has raged for decades about how much latitude a president should have in making such decisions and what role Congress should play. Legal contortionism has turned congressional authorizations for the use of force in one circumstance into blank permissions slips still cited by president decades later. This week, the Congress has begun to reconsider these profoundly important issues and we are joined by experts Steve Pomper, formerly of the Obama NSC, and Oona Hathaway, professor at Yale Law School, as well as regular co-host Ryan Goodman, co-editor of Just Security and professor at NYU Law School for a discussion on what changes are needed and which are possible. Don't miss it.Each week, we’re bringing you a new episode of one of our favorite podcasts, Deep State Radio.Deep State Radio, hosted by David Rothkopf, produces new episodes 2-3 times per week and brings together top experts, policymakers, and journalists from the national security, foreign policy, and political communities.
