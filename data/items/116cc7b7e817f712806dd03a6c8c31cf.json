  "description": "<p>The risk of a financial position shines through by means of the fluctuation\nof its market price. The factors affecting the price of a financial position\ninclude not only market internal factors, but also other various market\nexternal factors. The latter can be understood as sorts of environments to\nwhich financial positions have to expose. Motivated by this observation, this\npaper aims to design a novel axiomatic approach to risk measures in random\nenvironments. We construct a new distortion-type risk measure, which can\nappropriately evaluate the risk of financial positions in the presence of\nenvironments. After having studied its fundamental properties, we also\naxiomatically characterize it. Furthermore, its coherence and dual\nrepresentation are investigated. The new class of risk measures in random\nenvironments is large enough, for example, it not only can recover some known\nrisk measures such as the common weighted value at risk and range value at\nrisk, but also can induce other new specific risk measures such as risk\nmeasures in the presence of background risk. Examples are given to illustrate\nthe new framework of risk measures. This paper gives some theoretical results\nabout risk measures in random environments, helping one to have an insight look\nat the potential impact of environments on risk measures of positions.\n</p>",
