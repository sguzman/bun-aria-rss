The owl shift,\nthe graveyard shift. Feedingcleaninglovingfeeding.\nI walked home, heartsore, through pale streets,\nthe coins of Motherhood singing in my pockets.\nThen I soaked my spindled bones\nin the chill municipal baths of Motherhood,\nwatching strands of my hair float from my fingers.\nEach day I pushed my pram through freeze and blossom\ndown the wide boulevards of Motherhood\nwhere poplars bent their branches to stroke my brow.\nI stood with my sisters in the queues of Motherhood—\nthe weighing clinic, the supermarket—waiting\nfor Motherhood’s bureaucracies to open their doors.\nAs required, I stood beneath the flag of Motherhood\nand opened my mouth although I did not know the anthem.\nWhen darkness fell I pushed my pram home again,\nand by lamplight wrote urgent letters of complaint\nto the Department of Motherhood but received no response.\nI grew sick and was healed in the hospitals of Motherhood\nwith their long-closed isolation wards\nand narrow beds watched over by a fat moon.\nThe doctors were slender and efficient\nand when I was well they gave me my pram again\nso I could stare at the daffodils in the parks of Motherhood\nwhile winds pierced my breasts like silver arrows.\nIn snowfall, I haunted Motherhood’s cemeteries,\nthe sweet fallen beneath my feet—\nOur Lady of the Birth Trauma, Our Lady of Psychosis.\nI wanted to speak to them, tell them I understood,\nbut the words came out scrambled, so I knelt instead\nand prayed in the chapel of Motherhood, prayed\nfor that whole wild fucking queendom,\nits sorrow, its unbearable skinless beauty,\nand all the souls that were in it. I prayed and prayed\nuntil my voice was a nightcry\nand sunlight pixelated my face like a kaleidoscope.\n\n© Liz Berry. From 'The Republic of Motherhood' by Liz Berry (Chatto & Windus 2018).",
