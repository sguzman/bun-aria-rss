  "description": "<p>In this show I speak with Roman Horvath, a Master of Wine, is the Winery Director of <a href=\"https://www.domaene-wachau.at/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Domaine Wachau</a>, which is among the leading wine producers in Austria. The <a href= \"https://www.domaene-wachau.at/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Domaine </a> is actually a cooperative, meaning it is run by and owned by individual growers, with Roman bringing them all together under his leadership. But whereas most co-ops in Europe produce seas of mediocre to plain BAD wines, <a href=\"https://www.domaene-wachau.at/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Domaine Wachau</a> has been cited as one of the best co-ops in the world and is known for making wines of origin and pure flavor.</p> <p style=\"text-align: center;\"><a href= \"https://www.domaene-wachau.at/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\"><img style= \"display: block; margin-left: auto; margin-right: auto;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/Wachautown.png\" alt=\"\" width=\"371\" height=\"198\" /></a><span style= \"font-size: 8pt;\"><em>Photo: <a href= \"https://www.domaene-wachau.at/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Domaine Wachau</a></em></span></p> <p>The <a href=\"https://www.domaene-wachau.at/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Domaine</a> has a full range of Grüner Veltliner and Riesling that reflect their unique terroir – from small vineyard plots on steep terraces along the Danube to regional wines. Roman coordinates the vintner families, who work to capture the terroir of the historic wine region of Wachau. These wines are splendid and show how the co-op system can work well when under the right management.</p> <p> </p> <p>Here are the show notes:</p> <ul> <li>Roman tells us about his path through the MW and to becoming the managing director of <a href= \"https://www.domaene-wachau.at/en/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Domaine Wachau</a>.
