As a young boy, I watched a neighbor give a cat and a raccoon to one of the giant creatures and there was a second one that crawled from behind her house like a giant spider and it gave me nightmares for quite some time. Another encounter happened when a friend and I were driving and we witnessed what looked like King Kong chasing a doe and a buck across the highway on a cold winter night we were heading to Fayette Mississippi from Natchez.\"</p> <p> </p> <p>Tonight, Timothy Renner talks about the Albatwitch Day Saturday, October 12, 2019</p> <p>Check it out: <a href=\"https://albatwitchday.com/\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">https://albatwitchday.com/</a></p> <p> </p> <p>Also check out Timothy's work at: <a href= \"https://www.strangefamiliars.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">https://www.strangefamiliars.com/</a></p>",
