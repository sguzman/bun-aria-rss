  "description": "In Sovereign Acts: Performing Race, Space, and Belonging in Panama and the Canal Zone (Rutgers University Press, 2017), Katherine Zien examines the ways politicians, activists, artists, and residents performed and interpreted sovereignty in the Canal Zone from U.S. control over the zone in 1903 to its withdrawal in 1999. Moving beyond the big ditch and construction of the interoceanic canal, Zien explores how white Zonians, West Indian laborers and their descendants, and Panamanians wrestled with the issue of sovereignty over the Canal Zone in the area of popular entertainment. From clubhouses to the national theatre, Zien notes the performative nature of sovereignty as various historical actors challenged or upheld the performance of U.S. new imperialism.\nEnjoy this refreshing take on the history of the Canal Zone.\nSharika Crawford is associate professor of history at the United States Naval Academy.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
