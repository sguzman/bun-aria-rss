  "description": "Steven Dettelbach is the new head of the Bureau of Alcohol, Tobacco, Firearms and Explosives. Earlier this year he squeaked through the Senate confirmation process by a 48-46 vote.\nThe narrowness of his confirmation vote is a reflection of the challenges Dettelbach faces in leading the controversial agency in a polarized political environment. And despite a rise in gun violence in recent years, the ATF lacks the resources and manpower of other parts of the federal government.\nOn this episode of our weekly legal news podcast, On The Merits, Dettelbach sits down with Bloomberg Law reporter Courtney Rozen to explain how his agency is using data analytics to do more with less.\nDo you have feedback on this episode of On The Merits?
