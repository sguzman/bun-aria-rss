  "description": "<p>&nbsp;Worth thinking about from an MMT perspective. Someone needs to write a primer on econ and personal finance that ordinary folks can use as a compass to navigate in their decision making. It would not need to be a dedicated high school course but rather a book suitable for use as a high school course and which would also have wider application.</p><p>I took college electives in econ, investment, and statistics. The econ course used Samuelson, which most of the student recognized as not the way the world actually works, and it certainly did not help me navigate either personal economics or macro in understanding the world.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><p>On the other hand, the investment course used Graham's Intelligent Investor and Graham &amp; Dodd's Security Analysis. This was a worthwhile course.</p><p>It wasn't until I encountered MMT that I began to understand economic reality in terms of actual operations.</p>Conversable Economist<br /><a href=\"https://conversableeconomist.com/2022/11/03/high-school-economics-and-personal-finance-courses/\">High School Economics and Personal Finance Courses</a><br />Timothy Taylor | Managing editor of the Journal of Economic Perspectives, based at Macalester College in St. Paul, Minnesota|",
