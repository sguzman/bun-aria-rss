  "description": "<p>This week we're breaking down The Coup, so you better get ready for a fashion show, fashion show, fashion show at lunch! We start off with Movie Monday, Rainn Wilson shares a few memories about this episode, and a fan submits an interesting theory about Jim's shirt sleeves. Then we talk about Stamford and Call of Duty, we get Outlet Mall deep dives, and of course we couldn't forget Crentist the Dentist. Finally we wrap up with Michael and Dwight hugging it out, and Angela shares a journal entry and a couple deleted scenes. </p>\n",
