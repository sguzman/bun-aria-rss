  "description": "In today's podcast we hear that WannaCry's still here—just ask Honda and the Australian state of Victoria. North America and Europe work to secure their grids against CrashOverride. The US Congress hears testimony about Russian election influence ops: they didn't change the vote, but did they ever shake people up. Business email compromise scams hook sophisticated victims. The Queen's Speech says that, whatever else Brexit may mean, it won't mean a GDPR exit. Johns Hopkins University's Joe Carrigan review the ease of listening in on RF traffic. Asaf Cidon from Barracuda Networks on the increased threat from ransomware. And what's all this about CISOs and root canals? We didn't know that was an alternative to bearing bad news to the Board.",
