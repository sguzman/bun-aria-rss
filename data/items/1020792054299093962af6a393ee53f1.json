  "description": "On Tuesday’s Mark Levin Show, things are now happening in this country that will affect you directly. 19 Republicans in the Senate have surrendered to the American Marxist movement, with Mitch McConnell leading the way. How can McConnell be the Republican leader if the majority of Senate Republicans voted against the bill? The $1.2 Trillion infrastructure bill is filled with pork and pet projects, empowers Democrats, and expands government even more. Every Republican that voted for this bill has now paved the way for trillions of additional Democrat spending.  Later, Philip Klein of National Review calls In to discuss the infrastructure bill and the failure of Republicans to stop it. Also, there isn’t any difference between the various Democrat Marxist movements and the media. The climate movement has nothing to do with clean air or water, and everything to do with de-growth and anti-capitalism. The Green New Deal is exactly what Thomas Jefferson was referring to when he described tyranny of the legislature. Finally, Andrew Cuomo resigned as governor of New York, forced out not because of the nursing home deaths he caused but because of a damning report of sexual harassment. How does Biden keep escaping his sexual harassment scrutiny? Rep. Lee Zeldin calls in to give his take on Andrew Cuomo and the next governor of New York.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
