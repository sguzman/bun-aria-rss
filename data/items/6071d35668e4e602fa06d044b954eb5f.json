  "description": "On today’s show, Pat and the boys recap the Tyson Fury v. Deontae Wilder fight and how they were duped all week about how Fury had no chance. Pat explains how he’s now a huge Tyson Fury fan and doesn’t know how he wasn’t before this fight. Later, The Machine, Bert Kreischer joins Pat and the guys live in studio for over an hour of hilarity. They cover Bert’s new tour and Netflix Special that are going on right now, he lets people know what Joe Rogan is really like, talks with Pat more about his bet with Bill Burr that he could kick at least a 30 yard field goal in an NFL type of environment, chats about the Mickey Mantle gene, and gives his take on the XFL and gives a couple of ways he thinks they could improve the product. Plus Pat and Bert do an ad read for the ages. It’s a helluva good time. (14:34-1:10:18 ) Today’s show is a fun one, come and laugh with us. Cheers.\n",
