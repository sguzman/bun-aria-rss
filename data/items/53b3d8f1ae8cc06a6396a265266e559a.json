  "description": "<p>We're so sad that it's the season finale of Summer House. Goodbye Luke chopping wood; goodbye Danielle doing zoom calls; goodbye Stravy at his little desk; goodbye Ciara's bedroom laundry Jenga; goodbye Carl's growth (he's grown a lot, by the way); goodbye Paige's decaying relationship; goodbye Hannah's epic villain turn; and goodbye Lindsay making tacos. But here's one thing we'll never say goodbye to: Kyle and Amanda's wedding, a storyline which, after three seasons, apparently will never leave us.
