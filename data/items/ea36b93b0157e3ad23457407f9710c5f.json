  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, it’s stomach-turning to learn that much of what was reported yesterday wasn't accurate, including that there was no armed guard at the Robb elementary school in Texas. The killer made entry through a door that appears to have been unlocked. The children spent a full hour in the classroom filled with students before police physically stopped the killer according to Texas Dept. of Public Safety spokesperson Victor Escalon. According to reports from the Daily Mail the teachers used their bodies to shield the students. Parents and the media want accurate answers regarding the response time, and they want them now. Later, following President Biden’s remarks China announced Taiwan military drills. Notice how more confrontational China is becoming? China and Iran are on the move against us and if Washington politicians keep fooling around, we will end up effectively arming Iran with nuclear weapons. Afterward, Squad member Rep Rashida Tlaib accepted donations from a controversial antisemitic donor - a Rabbi. Rabbi Weiss attends anti-Israel rallies and donates money to Hezbollah. Yet, Sen Chuck Schumer is silent on his colleagues' acknowledgment of the Rabbi because he's afraid of the antisemitic squad taking aim at him.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
