    "media:description": "At its peak, Daewoo Group had been Korea's fourth largest business conglomerate along with Hyundai, Samsung, and LG. \n\nThe sprawling company rocketed upwards on the back of a favorable political environment and heaps of debt. \n\nThen in a shocking two year span, the whole group broke apart under the weight of its liabilities, a crushing recession, and widespread fraud. \n\nDaewoo's collapse tarnished the legacy of founder and chairman Kim Woo-Choong, who had to flee the country until he received a pardon. \n\nIn this video, we will look at the rapid rise and startling collapse of Korea's Daewoo Group. \n\nLinks:\n- The Asianometry Newsletter: https://asianometry.substack.com\n- Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/Asianometry\n- Twitter: https://twitter.com/asianometry",
