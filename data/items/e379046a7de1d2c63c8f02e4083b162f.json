It was developed by a scientist whose son suffered from asthma and who was frustrated by the fact HEPA air purifiers did not relieve his son’s symptoms. As a result, Dr.Yogi Goswami spent 20 years developing a completely new, totally effective way of removing indoor air pollutants. Unlike HEPA filters, Molekule destroys indoor air pollutants at a molecular level, completely removing them from the air you breathe.<br>\n<br>\nTonight’s episode is sponsored by Casper.
