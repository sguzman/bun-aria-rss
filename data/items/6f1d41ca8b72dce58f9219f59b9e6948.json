  "description": "Named one of the top 100 heroes and icons of the century by Time Magazine, Deepak Chopra has long been a towering figure in alternative medicine and spirituality. On this episode of Impact Theory with Tom Bilyeu, Deepak Chopra examines the nature of consciousness and pursues eternal questions like, “Who am I? What do I want? What’s my purpose? What am I grateful for?” While advocating reflection, meditation and awareness, he describes the results of the deeply examined life, and gives concrete advice on how to deal with chronic illness, day-to-day suffering, and even the fear of death.    For further information about Deepak Chopra please see <a href=\"http://www.deepakchopra.com\" rel=\"noopener\">www.deepakchopra.com</a>.
