Instead of wide receivers, tight ends and running backs, they'll be covering sports, entertainment, social issues, personal interests and more. Every Tuesday, the 8-time Pro Bowler Peterson and 2-time Super Bowl champion McFadden will discuss what's happening on the gridiron as well as what intrigues them off the field. Each week they'll welcome a star from the sports and entertainment world to have wide-ranging conversations about what interests them. Guests can include active or former football players but also athletes and influencers from other sports and walks of life. Football is how we know our hosts, but far from what defines Pat and BMac. The name says everything; expect all things to be covered!\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
