  "description": "<p>Around 4,500 years ago, bell-shaped ceramic drinking vessels called \"beakers\" begin showing up with the dead in tombs all over western Europe. Everywhere from Portugal to Sicily to Scotland to Slovakia, these distinctive containers show up, often accompanied by archery equipment and upheaval in the societies established in these places. The Bronze Age and metallurgy would soon follow. But what were the Beakers for? Who used them, and why? Thanks to ancient DNA and cutting-edge archaeological science, we can explore the Beaker Phenomenon in all its manifestations, from marriage networks and trade to prehistoric genocide.</p><p>I wrote a book, and it comes out on July 20!
