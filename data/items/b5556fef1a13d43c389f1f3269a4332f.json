  "description": "In this installment of Best Of The Gist, with recent gun reform regulations in our near past, the January 6th Hearings ongoing, and the ramifications of the overturn of Roe versus Wade yet to fully wash over us, we find ourselves yet again wondering about the future of our democracy. If only something could be done to lessen the chasm between the two parties…like maybe stop thinking about our politics as a binary equation? We thought it a good moment to listen back to Mike’s January 14, 2020 interview with Lee Drutman about his then-new book Breaking The Two Party Doom Loop: The Case For Multiparty Democracy In America. Then, we replay Thursday’s Spiel, in which Mike mulls over the Supreme Court’s aforementioned ruling on guns.\nProduced by Joel Patterson and Corey Wara\nEmail us at thegist@mikepesca.com\nTo advertise on the show, visit: https://advertisecast.com/TheGist \nLearn more about your ad choices.
