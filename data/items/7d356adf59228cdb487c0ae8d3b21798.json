  "description": "<p>Kirk Minihane eulogizes the once-glorious Boston sports radio station, WEEI. Cause of death? Pussy cancer. MSNBC has given Joy Ann Reid her own nighttime show despite her history of writing homophobic screeds -- and lying about having written them (0:59:00). Shannon Sharpe picks an odd hill to die on with his moving defense of not just DeSean Jackson, but Minister Farrakhan (01:09:20). Blind Mike is planning a hit new program for the Kirk Minihane Network.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
