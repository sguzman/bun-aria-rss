  "description": "<p>The state of many physical, biological and socio-technical systems evolves by\ncombining smooth local transitions and abrupt resetting events to a set of\nreference values. The inclusion of the resetting mechanism not only provides\nthe possibility of modeling a wide variety of realistic systems but also leads\nto interesting novel phenomenology not present in reset-free cases. However,\nmost models where stochastic resetting is studied address the case of a finite\nnumber of uncorrelated variables, commonly a single one, such as the position\nof non-interacting random walkers. Here we overcome this limitation by framing\nthe process of network growth with node deletion as a stochastic resetting\nproblem where an arbitrarily large number of degrees of freedom are coupled and\ninfluence each other, both in the resetting and non-resetting (growth) events.\nWe find the exact, full-time solution of the model, and several\nout-of-equilibrium properties are characterized as function of the growth and\nresetting rates, such as the emergence of a time-dependent percolation-like\nphase transition, and first-passage statistics. Coupled multiparticle systems\nsubjected to resetting are a necessary generalization in the theory of\nstochastic resetting, and the model presented herein serves as an illustrative,\nnatural and solvable example of such a generalization.\n</p>",
