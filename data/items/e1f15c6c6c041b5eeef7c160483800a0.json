  "description": "<p>In this month's fiction podcast, Tessa Hadley reads \"City Lovers,\" a story by the South African writer and 1991 Nobel Prize winner Nadine Gordimer. The story, which was published in The New Yorker in 1975, focusses on a love affair between a white man and a \"colored\" woman in Apartheid South Africa. It's deeply political in its details--the man is a geologist at a mining company, the couple's affair is illegal, and they cover it up by pretending that she is his servant. But Gordimer writes with a focussed intimacy that makes the piece a tragic love story rather than a political morality tale. \"One of the things I think she can teach us,\" says Hadley, \"is how to write politically without becoming shrill.\"</p>",
