  "title": "From Rural Texas to the World’s Financial Capitals: A Conversation with John Sloan",
  "description": "When John Sloan was growing up in a small town in rural Texas, he learned at a very early age what it takes to become a successful entrepreneur. John’s dad ran the local grocery store, and ever since he can remember, his father taught him by his own example the importance of a having a strong work ethic.\nIt was a lesson John has lived by ever since.\nHis path to becoming an entrepreneur, however, wasn’t a typical one. Very early in his career, he served as the president of The Thompson Companies, the family who founded the 7-11 chain of convenience stores. Not bad for someone still in his 30s.\nLater, he left the corporate world to test his entrepreneurial skills. After a brief stint investing in IT companies during the Internet bubble, he realized Internet companies weren’t for him. As a result, he focused on companies others weren’t interested in at the time—businesses he refers to as “your average well-run firms with good management, real value, and strong growth potential.”\nThe decision proved to be a smart one. Today, John runs John Sloan & Co., a boutique investment firm in Dallas. He is also president of GlobalScope, a worldwide network of 55 independent firms with over 10,000 completed private company deals to date.\nDon’t miss this exciting podcast.
