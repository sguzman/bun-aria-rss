  "title": "A Splash of Colour: Personal & Practical Approaches to Colour Mixing [25]",
  "description": "<p>This week’s main topic was inspired by a listener who wrote: “I was hoping you could talk about colour mixing/ opposed to buying already mixed colours. I'm wanting to invest in new paint, I’d just like to hear your opinion on different paints & colour mixing etc.”</p>\n<p>This question led us into a discussion of colour and the way we use it in our work. For both of us, it is quite an important focus, but our preferred palettes are quite different. We discuss the emotional resonance of certain colours; the power of surprising ourselves; the freedom that can come (paradoxically) with a limited palette; and mixing colours versus using them straight from the tube. We also discuss the relativity of colour, and Alice shares her approach of choosing one hero colour for each painting.</p>\n<p>In the end, colour is an incredibly personal thing, and each artist approaches it in a different way. Some artists study colour theory, some spend hours mixing in a sketchbook, and some choose colours totally intuitively. And this is perhaps the most important point to come out of our discussion - we both believe that your use of colour should be guided not be rules or by what you think other artists would do, but by your own preferences and your goals for your work.</p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://kelleewynnestudios.simplero.com/products/87723-True-Colors-Art-Program?ref=15311-Alice-Sheridan\">True Colors sign-up</a> (featuring Alice's lessons)&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.amazon.co.uk/Interaction-Color-Complete-Josef-Albers/dp/0300179359\">Joseph Albers - Interaction of Colour</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\"><strong>Buy us a coffee&nbsp;</strong></a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/dashboard/episode/bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\"><strong>bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</strong></a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><strong>Follow us on Instagram:</strong></p>\n<p>@alicesheridanstudio&nbsp;</p>\n<p>@louisefletcher_art &nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>See fuller show notes on our websites: &nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\"><strong>www.alicesheridan.com</strong></a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\"><strong>www.louisefletcherart.com</strong></a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p><u><strong>Credits</strong></u></p>\n<p><em>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com)</em></p>\n<p><em>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</em>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><br></p>\n",
