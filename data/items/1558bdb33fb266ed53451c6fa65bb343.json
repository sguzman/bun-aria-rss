  "description": "<p>In this episode, John looks at the NFL getting yet another timing break by not having to confront the issue of players boycotting games in protest of police brutality during the season (yet), why he thinks Jeff Bezos will be the next Washington Football Team owner if Dan Snyder is forced to sell, and why he's not worried about reports of Jordan Love struggling early in Packers camp. He also answers listener questions in the Middlekauff Mailbag.
