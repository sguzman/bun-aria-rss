  "title": "PMS 2.0 078 - Super Bowl Champ Matt Patricia & DEEP Thought Tuesday",
  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat stops into the Lion's Den in Detroit to sit down with 3x Super Bowl Champion, former defensive coordinator of the New England Patriots and current Head Coach of the Detroit Lions, Matt Patricia. They chat about his first year in Detroit and what he's learned from the entire process, the drama that he had to deal with from the media, what he learned during his time in New England, some of his defensive philosophies, who the toughest player he's ever had to game plan for is, his relationship with Matthew Stafford, why he decided to shave his beard down, whether or not he's taking notes all day with the pencil behind his ear, and much more (4:57-29:33). Pat also brings back everyone's favorite segment, \"Some Thoughts,\" and covers what he thinks about friend of the show, Jeopardy James, finally being defeated (or potentially losing on purpose) on Jeopardy!, why he thinks Andre Iguodala is the most under appreciated and underrated player in the NBA, and gives his thoughts on bare foot kickers. The guys also cover some documentaries and movies that they've recently watched, have a deep conversation about whether or not Elon Musk is an alien or a time traveler (or both), discuss the craze around quarterback's chugging beers, Andy Ruiz Jr. becoming the first Mexican Heavyweight Champion in arguably one of the biggest upsets in the history of boxing, and Pat announces the sale going on right now at store.patmcafeeshow.com featuring THE BRAND NEW Independence Day merch line that is currently 20% OFF. It's a great one, come and laugh with us. Cheers.</p>\n",
