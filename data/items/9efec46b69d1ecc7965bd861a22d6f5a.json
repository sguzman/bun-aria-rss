  "description": "<p>On Part 3 of Abortion: The Body Politic focuses on <em>Roe</em> and its unraveling. The last living <em>Roe</em> prosecutor, Linda Coffee, shares her recollections of that historic Supreme Court case and how she found out she had won. We learn of  the immediate failings of Roe, especially for Black women, and the birth of the Reproductive Justice movement. Experts trace the politicization of abortion, the belated moral-issue grab by evangelicals,  the violence that hit abortion doctors and clinics in the 1990s, and the anti-abortion strategy that forever altered American politics. We hear first-person experiences of long-time abortion doctors as well as fresh medical students who share why they felt inspired to join the cause. We also hear from two abortion storytellers about their experiences navigating a convoluted system that can be particularly apathetic to the needs of those seeking later abortions.</p>\n<p>More information on this episode’s guests and resources:</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https://accessrj.org/\">Access Reproductive Justice</a></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https://www.drhern.com/\">Boulder Abortion Clinic</a></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https://bixbycenter.ucsf.edu/\">The Bixby Center for Reproductive Health</a></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https://prh.org/\">Physicians for Reproductive Health</a></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https://www.doulaproject.net/#:~:text=The%20Doula%20Project%20is%20an,over%20fifty%20full%2Dspectrum%20doulas.\">The Doula Project</a></li>\n</ul>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https://www.plannedparenthood.org/planned-parenthood-gulf-coast\">Planned Parenthood Gulf Coast</a></li>\n</ul>\n<p>Books and more</p>\n<ul>\n<li aria-level=\"1\"><a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/news/2017/01/roe-v-wades-secret-heroine-tells-her-story\">Roe v.
