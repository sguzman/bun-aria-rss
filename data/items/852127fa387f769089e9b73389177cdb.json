  "description": "<p>In the years following the Fukushima nuclear disaster of 2011, the conversation around decarbonizing the energy sector moved away from nuclear. However, current commodity price volatility has brought nuclear back to the fore and countries that were previously focused on decommissioning nuclear power stations are now, once again, discussing its virtues. Will this spur a nuclear renaissance and how might this time be different from the 1960s and 1970s? What technology breakthroughs could make the future of nuclear different, and will they happen quickly enough to respond to current market signals? To address these questions and more, Dana Perkins speaks with Chris Gadomski, lead nuclear analyst at BloombergNEF.</p>\n<p>This episode of Switched On draws upon a BNEF research note titled, Nuclear 1H 2022 Market Outlook: Unprecedented Opportunity. To access this research, BNEF subscribers can find it at BNEF on the Bloomberg Terminal, at bnef.com or via our mobile app.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
