  "title": "Kirk Minihane Ponders Blind Mike's Fate",
  "description": "<p><p>Kirk Minihane had a rough Labor Day weekend. While most Americans were drinking beer and playing corn hole, Minihane was dealing with one crazy after another in this bizarre cult he's running. Former interim producer turned freelance sales specialist Dave Cullinane went off the deep end and threatened to quit running Minihane's Instagram for free. MHB had his livelihood threatened by some insane internet troll. Blind Mike's negotiations with Barstool Sports are not going well and Minihane's not happy to be in the middle of it. Also today: More fall out from Dave Chappelle's Netflix comedy special, racism at Starbucks, and the boys search for a new network television show they can watch together.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
