  "description": "Life’s stories are like a pumpkin pail of candy filled with unexpected tricks, treats and monstrosities. You never know what you’ll pull out of it. In every turn a new surprise tale waits to be unwrapped. It may be something sweet or as sharp as a razorblade. You may get cut, you may be cursed or worse pulling from your bag of monstrosities. First, just one bite of stolen candy has horrific consequences. And then, a creepy sibling rivalry goes too far. Followed by, the ringing phone you must not answer. And finally, we bring you part two of “Jeff the Killer”, our abridged retelling of the anonymous creepy pasta.\n\n\nWhen your teamwork is effective - nothing can stop you.
