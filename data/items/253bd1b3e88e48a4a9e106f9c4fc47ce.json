  "description": "i feel like every day at least once, i catch myself reading an article about celebrity drama. and every once in a while, i'll look in the comments section...and i've noticed a theme: there are two types of comments. some comments are just about the situation being reported on, you know, people putting in their two cents, sharing their opinion, etc. the other comments are people saying, ‘take this down and stop talking about this person's private life.’ no matter what the situation is, there are these two types of comments. and this just really got me thinking about this argument...how much privacy do celebrities deserve? and it is a complicated, complicated dilemma. so i wanted to deep dive into the dilemma today, share my thoughts, opinions, have an open conversation and see what conclusion we come to, if any. we probably won't come to a conclusion, but it's just something really interesting to dissect. \n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
