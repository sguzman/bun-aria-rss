  "description": "In Piety and Rebellion: Essays in Hasidism (Academic Studies Press, 2019), Shaul Magid examines the span of the Hasidic textual tradition from its earliest phases to the 20th century. The essays collected in this volume focus on the tension between Hasidic fidelity to tradition and its rebellious attempt to push the devotional life beyond the borders of conventional religious practice. Many of the essays exhibit a comparative perspective deployed to better articulate the innovative spirit, and traditional challenges, Hasidism presents to the traditional Jewish world. Piety and Rebellion is an attempt to present Hasidism as one case whereby maximalist religion can yield a rebellious challenge to conventional conceptions of religious thought and practice.\nShaul Magid is the Distinguished Fellow in Jewish Studies at Dartmouth College and has written extensively on Jewish Thought, Kabbalah, Hasidism, and American Jewish Culture.\nSchneur Zalman Newfield is an Assistant Professor of Sociology at Borough of Manhattan Community College, City University of New York, and the author of Degrees of Separation: Identity Formation While Leaving Ultra-Orthodox Judaism (Temple University Press, 2020).\nLearn more about your ad choices.
