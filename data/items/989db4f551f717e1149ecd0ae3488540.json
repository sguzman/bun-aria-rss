  "description": "Brace yourself… today’s show offers something that’s non-existent in the current market: optimism. Believe it or not, the widespread negativity is actually a bullish sign for investors.  On today’s podcast, I recap the last week of trading, the 40-year high in inflation, and what to expect from the Fed next week.  There are a lot of issues putting pressure on the market, but here’s the bottom line: You need to be a contrarian… especially now that nearly everyone is bearish. I also sift through the data the Fed is watching… and explain why Fed Chair Jerome Powell is about to trigger a big market rally over the next couple of months. In this episode:  Why I’m optimistic (and you should be too) [1:00] Why the Fed’s rate hikes could slow by September [3:00] Some signs inflation is coming down [9:15] What the latest bank earnings tell us about the economy [14:15] This is how a market bottom forms [17:10] These contrarian indicators are making me bullish [25:05] How Fed Chief Powell will ignite a 15% market rally (or more) [30:50]  Enjoyed this episode?
