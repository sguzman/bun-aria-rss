  "description": "On the Best of Mark Levin, Donald J. Trump, the 45th President of the United States, joins the show to give his first reaction to President Biden's 2nd press conference of his Presidency. Trump said he really wants Biden to do well if he can. Trump commented on Biden's weakness indicating that he expected Vladimir Putin to take advance into Ukraine. Trump also mentioned that there was no vaccine hesitancy during his Administration, surmising that the American people simply don't trust Biden because of his initial anti-vaccine rhetoric. Then, Trump said Biden's reckless withdrawal from Afghanistan is the lowest moment in the history of our country. Trump criticized the 2020 election as a third world election adding that Democrats must be stopped from conducting a federal takeover of US elections. Nancy Pelosi's son Paul Jr. is connected to several companies investigated by the FBI and the media is barely reporting on it. One of the biofuel companies even defrauded investors. Paul Jr is frugal but nowhere near being strapped for cash. A special counsel's criminal investigation into all of the Pelosi's dealings is definitely warranted. Then, CAIR (Council on American Islamic Relations) attacks the talk radio industry but defended and advocated for the release of Aafia Siddiqui. CAIR has enormous influence with members of Congress, the FBI, and the DOJ. The Supreme Court of the United States (SCOTUS) got it right when they struck down President Biden's unconstitutional federal vaccine mandate enforced by OSHA, and got it totally wrong on the healthcare case where SCOTUS ruled that healthcare workers in facilities receiving federal funds may keep their mandates in place. Then, the Democrat party is the party of the KKK, racism, and segregation. They were that way during the civil war, and they are that way today. Chuck Schumer and his razor-thin majority will peddle every lie they can to convince people that the Democrats' voting bill does something more than weaken a citizen's right to vote.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
