Today’s discussion gives us an introduction to George Eliot and covers the first three chapters of the book. Thomas shares a little historical context for the setting of <em>Silas Marner</em> and how that affects the interpretation of this book. Angelina points out the ways in which Eliot uses some fairy tale and otherworldly elements to explore moral ideas.</p> <p>Don’t forget to check out Angelina and Thomas’ upcoming classes at <a href= \"https://houseofhumaneletters.com/\">HouseofHumaneLetters.com</a> and <a href= \"https://www.patreon.com/cindyrollins?fbclid=IwAR3acx7P6FGt1Us_buk7cIzIaK31FxMaNlK53pKfV5vr8SYphKVywNIAqZ8\"> Cindy’s Discipleship for Moms on Patreon</a>.</p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>A poem can be like two hands that lift you up and put you down in a new place.
