With zero politicians in Congress calling out Biden for escalating tensions with Russia or doing little more for progressive causes than sending hopeful tweets, she believes that US politicians who call themselves left are finally revealing their true colors.\nThis loss of true progressives worsened under President Obama: “I think Obama’s presidency is one of the worst things to happen to Black people politically.”\n“No one talks about what he did to Libya. What he tried to do to Syria. When you see a story about migrants drowning at sea, that’s Barack Obama.” And yet, in the halls of Democratic Congress, he remains infallible.\nTo Kimberley, if you’re silent on war mongering and profiteering, you shouldn’t be considered left.\nPlus, Margaret shares her thoughts on Joe Rogan, Biden’s terrible Covid response, and the fall of progressive news:\n“Would the Pentagon Papers be published today? I don’t think so. I think if there was some bombshell revelation about Ukraine, the New York Times and Washington Post wouldn’t touch it. We need people with more courage.”\nIt’s all this, and more, on this week’s episode of Useful Idiots. Check it out.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
