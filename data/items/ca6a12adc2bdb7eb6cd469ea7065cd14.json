  "description": "<p><b>It’s the first week in our Esther series! Raechel and Amanda sit down with speaker, author, and Bible teacher, Vivian Mabuni. Calling in from the West coast, Vivian wakes up extra early to dive into one of her favorite books of the Bible: Esther, a book about the young Jewish queen who fights for her people. The three women discuss royal banquets and beauty pageants, fasting and lamenting, and what it looks like to serve without seeing a reward or outcome. This week’s reading ends with a cliffhanger, challenging us to follow God while remembering what’s true—even when we can’t see the end of the story.  </b></p><p><b>Read with Us: </b></p><p><b>This episode corresponds to Week 1 of the She Reads Truth Esther reading plan found on the </b><a href='http://t.ly/1JyqM'><b>She Reads Truth app</b></a><b> and </b><a href='https://shereadstruth.com/plans/'><b>SheReadsTruth.com</b></a><b>. </b></p><p><b>Shop the Esther collection at </b><a href='https://www.shopshereadstruth.com/collections/esther'><b>ShopSheReadsTruth.com</b></a><b>. </b></p><p><b>Show notes can be found at </b><a href='https://shereadstruth.com/podcast/esther-week-1-with-vivian-mabuni/'><b>shereadstruth.com/podcast/esther-week-1-with-vivian-mabuni/</b></a></p>",
