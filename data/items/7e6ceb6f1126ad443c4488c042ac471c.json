The response to such life altering events has varied drastically from person to person and country to country. Some people found opportunities where none existed before, while others sat in disbelief not sure how to move forward or what to do. Dave Hollis has gone through his own sudden changes over the last couple of years, not related to the pandemic, and they’ve been the kind of changes that challenge your identity and the core of who you say you are and who you think of yourself to be. On the other side of these unexpected life events, he’s emerged with an experience to share about what standing in fear looked like while turning what was utterly terrifying into an exhilarating experience worth sharing. Dave shares his journey of losing everything to find everything else he was capable of creating and more once he learned how to construct a new identity, a purpose, and fulfillment through courage. He reminds us in his latest book, Built Through Courage, “the antidote to fear is a plan.” Do you have a plan in place to help you deal with the unexpected changes life is throwing your way?   “It is not until we've lost everything that we can do anything” -Tyler Durden (Fight Club)   Order Dave Hollis new book, Built Through Courage:  <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Built-Through-Courage-Fears-Meant/dp/B09129JGT6\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.amazon.com/Built-Through-Courage-Fears-Meant/dp/B09129JGT6</a>   SHOW NOTES:   0:00 | Introduction Dave Hollis 1:38 | Unexpected Life Changes 8:18 | Adjusting to New Reality 16:33 | Who You Want To Be 23:34 | Inner Voice Guidance 32:32 | Fulfillment and Purpose 34:56 | Leaving the Known 38:28 | Built Through Courage 45:38 | Stuck in Your Story 50:29 | Toxic Positivity 56:34 | Tested to New Depths 1:02:51 | Becoming Is A Decision   QUOTES:   “There is no control. There's only the way that we respond to the circumstances that life presents” [3:22]   “The place I had to start, to be honest, was really getting intimate with my fear. Because most of why my imagination had been lost was because there was so much fear around trying to figure out something that I'd never contemplated.” [6:50]   “I got to at least build the sail, I gotta put it up so that when the wind starts to come, I'm actually prepared to move forward.” [11:36]   “You think good things are going to come out of this, you will become something because of the post traumatic growth that can come out of the hardest thing that you've ever experienced.” [22:02]   “We're willing to stay inside of suffering that we know, rather than facing the possibility of something new, because the knowns of that existing suffering feel predictable [...] The challenge in pushing away though, is that that safe harbor is surrounded on all sides by fear.” [39:58]   “People get stuck because they let the circumstances of what's happening in real time, cast a probability future, a likely to happen next future, that is clouded by the subjectivity of what they're currently experiencing.” [49:30]   “The way that I feel about my faith is fundamentally different because of having to have my faith tested. I was forced to my knees.” [57:24]   “In the moment, when it feels like life is ending, you forget that there's so many firsts, and so many nexts and so many beautiful moments.” [1:01:17]   Follow Dave Hollis: Website: <a href=\"https://mrdavehollis.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://mrdavehollis.com/</a> Instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/mrdavehollis/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/mrdavehollis/</a> Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MrDaveHollis\" rel=\"noopener\">https://twitter.com/MrDaveHollis</a> LinkedIn: <a href=\"https://www.linkedin.com/in/dave-hollis-b5a48671/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.linkedin.com/in/dave-hollis-b5a48671/</a> Facebook: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/mrdavehollis\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/mrdavehollis</a> YouTube:  <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnB48Dc40d9vLvkyUfUcMlA\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCnB48Dc40d9vLvkyUfUcMlA</a>",
