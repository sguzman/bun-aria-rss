They also welcome ESPN MLB Insider Jeff (Jett) Passan to get more info on how the Marlins outbreak started, what the implications are league wide, how he thinks Rob Manfred dealt with the situation, and whether or not this type of wake up call will prove to be effective for the rest of the MLB (22:52-35:21). Later, Pat and AJ welcome NFL Insider for FOX Sports, Jay Glazer. They chat about what things will be like for Jay's training camp tour now that he'll have to do it all virtually, what he's hearing from NFL teams in response to the Marlins covid19 outbreak, he walks them through the breaking news situation from earlier this summer that had a lot of people upset with him, and how he would have done it differently looking back at it (1:07:12-1:22:44). To close out the show, Pat welcomes on College Football Hall of Famer, National Champion, Bear Bryant Coach of the Year recipient, and current Head Coach of the North Carolina Tar Heels, Mack Brown. Pat and Mack discuss what it's been like getting players ready for a season, his thoughts on what this season will look like, his philosophy towards changing the culture at UNC, when he knew it was time to leave Texas, and what he might do after coaching (1:40:21-2:01:55).
