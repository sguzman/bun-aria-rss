  "description": "<p>\"IT’S ALL ABOUT SHOWING PEOPLE A GENUINELY GOOD TIME.\"<br />\nBeing an entrepreneur is one of the most difficult tasks you can take on. In fact, some people find it soul crushing if not done right. When done properly, though, it can be the greatest thing you can do in your life.<br />\nStarting as an entrepreneur means knowing what you really want to do, what your passion is and how to deliver that to consumers. It’s not about pushing it on them but listening to them and seeing how you can serve them.<br />\nMost entrepreneurs stop as soon as they hit success and sell off their company, but not all of them. On this episode, we are joined by Michael Mente, who has been successful since 2003 when he helped create the incredibly popular clothing company: REVOLVE.<br />\n“All we are doing is listening to the consumer and giving them what they want.”<br />\nMichael Mente dropped out of an Entrepreneur program at the University of Southern California to become an entrepreneur by profession. He’s Currently the CEO and Co-Founder of Revolve and is set to bring in $400 million in sales this year. His company is considered the one-stop shop for clothing items designed by some of the hottest emerging designers.<br />\nOver the years, Michael began developing organic relationships with bloggers to represent the brand on a more realistic level. To do so, Revolve regularly holds trips for influencers to gather, relax, and recreate the lifestyle of an ideal Revolve customer.<br />\nMichael saw a gap between affordable and high end items, which provided grounds for him to create an online shopping experience that falls in the middle. Supporting up-and-coming designers and digital influencers has become the core of Revolve’s growth and they decided to expand their digital offerings by launching a sister company, FORWARD, in 2008. Since then FORWARD has grown to become a powerhouse in fashion and has become the go-to place for premier luxury fashion.<br />\nI loved Michael's humble wisdom about what it has taken to create this kind of success in such a competitive industry.<br />\nDiscover all of that and much more, on Episode 583.<br />\n\"If it’s not enjoyable, what’s the point?”<br />\nSome Questions I Ask:<br />\nWould you say a lot of your sales come from Instagram? (10:46)<br />\nIn the beginning were you buying clothes wholesale? (13:41)<br />\nWhat were you doing before REVOLVE? (15:40)<br />\nWhat would you say is your biggest inspiration right now?
