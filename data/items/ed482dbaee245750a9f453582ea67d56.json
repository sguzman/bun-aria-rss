  "description": "<p>You're in your 30s, single, and you have a problem with prostitutes. You don't even really enjoy the experience and you know it's not worth your time, money, or the legal or health risks, but you still have an irresistible compulsion to continue meeting with them. Even more troubling is that you've noticed it's slowly changing how you see money and women. You know you'd like to settle down with the right woman some day, but you worry that the temptation to cheat on her with a prostitute could ruin everything. It's out of control. So what can you do?
