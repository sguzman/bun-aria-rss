  "description": "Today I talked with D. G. Hart, an historian at Hillsdale College, MI, and the author of many books, including Calvinism: A History (Yale University Press, 2013). Listed on the front cover of Time (2009) as one of the ten “ideas changing the world right now,” Calvinism has a formidable history as a global theological movement. Hart’s book offers an expansive account of how one set of protestant ideas evolved from Geneva, Zurich and Basle to become one of the most important intellectual traditions in western Christianity.\n\n\n\nCrawford Gribben is a professor of history at Queen’s University Belfast. His research interests focus on the history of puritanism and evangelicalism, and he is the author most recently of John Owen and English Puritanism (Oxford University Press, 2016).\nLearn more about your ad choices.
