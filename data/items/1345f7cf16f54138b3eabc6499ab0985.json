  "description": "Today's show is anchored by a couple of great guests. First, on another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk, Pat and AJ welcome 8x Pro Bowler, San Diego Chargers 50th Anniversary Team Member, a man currently ranked 6th all-time in passing yards and touchdowns, the Quarterback of the Indianapolis Colts, Philip Rivers. Pat, AJ, and Phil discuss his time in San Diego/LA, when he thought it might be time to move on, if there was ever serious consideration to him retiring, why the Colts seemed like the perfect fit, how hard it is to adjust to a new locker room after being in San Diego/LA for 16 years, his plans for after football, and how excited he is to get the season started (:20-25:00). Plus Pat and AJ break down Leonard Fournette signing with the Bucs, their thoughts on the Alvin Kamara situation, Kirk Cousins saying if he dies he dies (from the coronavirus), and everything else in the NFL as we close in on the start of the 2020 season (:20-55:56). Next, former Head Coach of the Oakland Raiders, Tennessee Volunteers, USC Trojans, Florida Atlantic Panthers, and current HC of Ole Miss, Lane Kiffin joins the program. Pat and Lane chat about what he's been doing to prepare his time during covid, if there was ever a thought the the SEC wouldn't play games, why he likens his time at Alabama like going to rehab, if he ever considered going back to the NFL, and how much he has to give up in terms of calling plays and trying to control things being a Head Coach as opposed to a coordinator (56:00-1:18:16). To close out the show, 2x Super Bowl Champion, Super Bowl MVP, NFL MVP, 3x Pro Bowler, 3x All-Pro, member of the 1990's All-Decade Team and Denver Broncos Ring of Fame, friend of the program, Terrell Davis stops by. Pat and Terrell chat about the Leonard Fournette situation, the current running back market and why it's a tough time to be wanting a contract extension as a RB in the NFL, his thoughts on the season as we get closer to kickoff, his thoughts on the Broncos and why he thinks Drew Lock is going to take them to the next level, and what his plans are for the upcoming NFL season (1:18:18-1:41:40). We can't thank you enough for listening and letting us penetrate your eyes every week. Have the greatest weekend ever. Come and laugh with us, cheers.\n",
