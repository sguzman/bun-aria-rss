George became known as The Father of Railways and yet arguably Robert's contribution was even greater, with his engineering work going far beyond their collaboration. \n\nRobert is credited with the main role in the design of their locomotives. George had worked on stationary colliery steam engines and, with Robert, developed the moving steam engine Locomotion No1 for the Stockton and Darlington Railway in 1825. They produced the Rocket for the Rainhill Trials on the Liverpool and Manchester Railway in 1829. From there, the success of their designs and engineering led to the expansion of railways across Britain and around the world. \n\nwith \n\nDr Michael Bailey\nRailway historian and editor of the most recent biography of Robert Stephenson\n\nJulia Elton\nPast President of the Newcomen Society for the History of Engineering and Technology\n\nand\n\nColin Divall\nProfessor Emeritus of Railway Studies at the University of York\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson.\nThis programme is a repeat",
