  "description": "Bringing a fresh contemporary Freudian view to a number of current issues in psychoanalysis, this book is about a psychoanalytic method that has been evolved by Fred Busch over the past 40 years called Creating a Psychoanalytic Mind: A Psychoanalytic Method and Theory (Routledge, 2013). It is based on the essential curative process basic to most psychoanalytic theories—the need for a shift in the patient’s relationship with their own mind. Busch shows that with the development of a psychoanalytic mind, the patient can acquire the capacity to shift the inevitability of action to the possibility of reflection.\nCreating a Psychoanalytic Mind is derived from an increasing clarification of how the mind works that has led to certain paradigm changes in the psychoanalytic method. While the methods of understanding the human condition have evolved since Freud, the means of bringing this understanding to patients in a way that is meaningful have not always followed. Throughout, Fred Busch illustrates that while the analyst’s expertise is crucial to the process, the analyst’s stance, rather than mainly being an expert in the content of the patient’s mind, is primarily one of helping the patient to find his own mind.\nFred Busch is a Training and Supervising Analyst, Boston Psychoanalytic Institute and Society. He has published 5 books and over 70 papers. His work has been translated into multiple languages.\nPhilip Lance, Ph.D. is a psychoanalyst in private practice in Los Angeles. He can be reached at PhilipJLance@gmail.com and his website is here. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
