Called <i>Modern Comfort Food</i>, Ina timed its release a month before the election because she knew we would need some decadence and deliciousness right about now.

The result is updated, elegant takes on beef stew, chocolate cake, nachos, pizza, potato puree, plus fun cookies, cocktails, and much more. Ina joins host Kerry Diamond to talk about her book, her life under quarantine, her time working at the White House (not on state dinners—on nuclear policy and budgeting!), and her Thanksgiving turkey tips.
