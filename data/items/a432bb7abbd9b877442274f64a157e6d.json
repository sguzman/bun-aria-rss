  "description": "<p>This week on Let’s Eat In, our host Cathy Erway is talking fermented foods with Sandor Katz. Sandor is the author of two books- Wild Fermentation and The Art of Fermentation- that are essential tomes on the health benefits and preparation of fermented foods. Wine, coffee, beer, and bread are all the result of microbial activity- so why are so many people afraid of bacteria? Tune in to listen to Sandor and Cathy talk about the importance of the so-called “food revival”, the difference between pickling and fermenting, and some of the food safety stigmas associated with at-home food fermentation. Sandor and Cathy also talk about how small amounts of fermented foods can really add flavor to otherwise bland staples like bread or rice. What is Sandor’s perfect date meal? I’ll give you a hint: it involves a delicious take on fermented classic!
