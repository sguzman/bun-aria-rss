  "description": "Yes, we went in-depth with the All Too Well: The Short Film and ATWTMVTVFTV but we haven't stopped to appreciate the original lyrics and since we are always hungry for more Taylor Swift, here it is! <br />Ana, Nick, Amy and Lacey do a deep dive into this lyrical masterpiece of a song that weaves in and out of a relationship that seemed very important and promising to one, and dismissive to another. What all is Taylor Swift saying in this song? And how much research did we put into this classic song once again? A LOT.. so sit back and enjoy!<br />What did we miss? What would you like to hear from us? And what thoughts and theories would you like to share? There's lots of ways to reach us and we love hearing from you!<br /><br />CONTACT THE PODCAST!<br />Email – <a href=\"mailto:the13podcast@gmail.com\">the13podcast@gmail.com</a><br />IG: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/the13podcast\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/the13podcast</a><br />TikTok: <a href=\"https://www.tiktok.com/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.tiktok.com/</a>@the13podcast<br /> <br />FOLLOW US!<br />Ana - <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/anacas31\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/anacas31</a><br />Lacey – <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/laceygee13\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/laceygee13</a><br />Amy – <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/amysnichols\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/amysnichols</a><br />Nick – <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/nickadamspics\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/nickadamspics</a><br /> <br />CHECK OUT OUR OTHER PODCASTS!<br />Lacey & Amy – \"Loose Lips & Child-Bearing Hips\"<br />Ana - \"On Cloud Wine\"<br />Nick – \"Shut Up!\" & \"The Chatty Daddies\"<br /> <br />This podcast is in no way related to or endorsed by Taylor Swift, her companies, or record labels.
