  "description": "<p>One possible interpretation of two narrow $\\Omega^0_c$ states reported by the\nLHCb Collaboration at CERN in 2017 is that they are pentaquarks belonging to a\n$\\overline{\\boldsymbol{15}}$ exotic SU(3) representation, as predicted by the\nChiral Quark--Soliton Model. If so, there must exist a number of other exotic\nstates since the model predicts three different $\\overline{\\boldsymbol{15}}$\nmultiplets of heavy baryons. We show, that depending on the soliton spin $J$,\nthese states are either very narrow or very broad. This explains why they might\nhave escaped experimental observation. Furthermore, we show that the lightest\nmembers of these multiplets are stable against two body strong decays.\n</p>",
