  "description": "Our audiobook this week is PALPITATION by Ofelia Martinez\n\nThe kiss I stole from Leonardo Moreno on my eighteenth birthday must have been the worst kiss of his life because, within months, he enlisted in the army, and I never saw him again.\n\nTalk about ghosting.\n\nI did everything I could to forget the tall, dark, and handsome soldier with soulful, brown eyes. Instead, I focused on getting my medical degree and starting my emergency medicine residency.\n\nWhen a family emergency leads me back home, the last person I think I’ll see as a civilian is Leo.\n\nSparks fly when we reconnect, and this time, instead of pushing me away, he holds on tight.\n\nNow all we have to do is keep us a secret from his best friend—my over-protective older brother.\n\nGET THE eBOOK NOW: https://bit.ly/3RtzJsG\nOfelia Martinez: https://bit.ly/3yx8O6W\nGiveaway: https://bit.ly/3awV9oc\nFREE eBook: https://bit.ly/3nWKc2A\nHeartland Metro Hospital: https://bit.ly/3IvIRsQ\nIndustrial November Series: https://bit.ly/3NZDzHj\nDiagnosis Amor: https://bit.ly/3O3j5NI\n\nOther Mentions\nHOT GIRL SUMMER BOOK BOX - RMR Newsletter: https://bit.ly/2PlYuL7\nCaptive in the Dark\nUndertow by Alessandra Torre\nKresley Cole\n\n♥ ♥ ♥\n\nRMR Website: https://bit.ly/3ifFIyw\nRead Me Romance Merch: https://bit.ly/39JB8XG\nWeekly New Release: https://bit.ly/30iDete\nFollow Read Me Romance on Instagram: https://geni.us/uUVdVeY\nLatest Alexa Riley Releases: https://bit.ly/3qrQpVS\nJoin Read Me Romance Headquarters on FB: https://geni.us/IdL7B\nFind Alexa Riley on Instagram: https://bit.ly/2HGrxpQ\nAlexa Riley TikTok: https://vm.tiktok.com/TTPdUryXr9/\n\nRead Me Romance Theme Song by L.B.
