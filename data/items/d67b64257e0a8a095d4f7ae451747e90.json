  "title": "PMS 2.0 147 - Chris Johnson, WILD Week In The Football, Punter Of The Decade? And A Rather Large Giveaway At The End",
  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys break down everything that happened in a very wild week 17 of the NFL as the AFC and NFC playoff fields are now set. They discuss whether or not the Patriots loss to the Dolphins spells the eventual demise of their dynasty, and why this Patriots team feels so much different heading into the playoffs than teams of the past. They also cover the Packers being a half yard shy of earning the #1 seed in the NFC, and whether or not they're a team to be reckoned with. Pat also goes down the list of coaching vacancies and gives his thoughts on where certain guys will end up, including his thoughts on Lincoln Riley to the Cowboys, Mike McCarthy to the Browns, Ron Rivera to the Redskins, and why he thinks now might be the time for Matt Rhule to make the jump to the NFL. Later, 3x Pro Bowler, All-Pro, NFL record holder for most scrimmage yards in a season (2,509), friend of the show and former Titans and Cardinals running back, CJ2K, Chris Johnson joins Pat and the guys to preview this weekend's Titans/Patriots matchup. Chris gives his thoughts on Derrick Henry, and why he thinks this Titans team has been so successful this year. Chris also breaks down the importance of running back's getting touches early in a game in order to get into a flow before the start of the 4th quarter, why he thinks this Titans team is long overdue to beat the Patriots, whether he thinks their dynasty is done, and why you can never count out Tom Brady (39:10-52:07). Also included is Pat's reaction to being named PFF's punter of the decade, and the guys all react to the College Football Playoff semifinal games, and look ahead to Trevor Lawrence vs. Joe Burrow in the National Championship. Today's show is a good one. Come and laugh with us. Cheers.</p>\n",
