  "description": "While some argue Georgia Senate candidate Raphael Warnock can’t support abortion and Christianity, Glenn takes another angle: Can he believe black liberation theology and still be a Christian? Dr. Steven LaTulippe and his attorney, Mariah Gondeiro, join after he lost his medical license over his opinion on masks. President Trump tweeted what some claim is a concession, but Bill O’Reilly thinks otherwise and calls for Attorney General Barr to open an investigation into the election. The teacher who revealed the disgusting sex-ed topics she refuses to teach gives an uplifting update. The media is conveniently no longer dismissing Hunter Biden’s laptop controversy. Attorney Alan Dershowitz discusses the election lawsuit filed in Texas. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
