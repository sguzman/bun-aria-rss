  "description": "<p>On this episode of the Bear Grease [Render], the crew starts out with a discussion on Clay's recent brush with the intoxicating power of a D6 Caterpillar bulldozer. They'll jump into a wild story of the Newcomb's near immortal rooster, which comes with a song. Finally, they discuss the \"Snake Bit\" episode and all the wild stories on the podcast. The crew learned a lot from Dr. Chris Jenkins of the Snake Talk Podcast, were shocked by Fred Lally's life, and were deeply impacted by Lisa Damron's story. You're not going to want to miss this laugh-filled, yet meaningful episode. </p><p><br></p><p>Connect with <a href=\"https://www.themeateater.com/authors/claynewcomb\">Clay</a> and <a href=\"https://www.themeateater.com/\">MeatEater</a></p><p>Clay on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/clay_newcomb\">Instagram</a></p><p>MeatEater on <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/meateater\">Instagram</a>, <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/StevenRinellaMeatEater/\">Facebook</a>, <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MeatEaterTV?ref_src=twsrc%5Egoogle%7Ctwcamp%5Eserp%7Ctwgr%5Eauthor\">Twitter</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCAaa0mleeU128Ad5iM1RFIg\">Youtube</a></p><p>Shop <a href=\"https://store.themeateater.com/products/bear-grease-hat\">Bear Grease Merch</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
