  "description": "<p>We finally made it! The first week of the NFL season is here and Chad Millman and Simon Hunter of the Action Network return for a deep dive into all 16 games on the NFL slate, from Thursday to Monday Night Football, and everything in between. Chad is the head of content here at the Action Network, and Simon is a seasoned handicapper and professional sports bettor, who frequently shows Chad the proper ways to avoid traps and read the market from a professional gambler's perspective. Together they talk spreads, totals and moneylines, and give their early leans for the NFL Best Bets they'll settle on later this week on our Thursday show. We play a round of Simon Says, where we hold our nose and tail Simon's ugliest pick, and so much more.</p><p>TB/DAL (7 MIN)</p><p>TEN/AZ (12 MIN)</p><p>SEA/IND (15 MIN)</p><p>WAS/LAC (19 MIN)</p><p>JAX/HOU (21 MIN)</p><p>NYJ/CAR (26 MIN)</p><p>BUF/PIT (29 MIN)</p><p>CIN/MIN (34 MIN)</p><p>PHL/ATL (36 MIN)</p><p>SF/DET (38 MIN)</p><p>CLE/KC (42 MIN)</p><p>DEN/NYG (44 MIN)</p><p>NO/GB (46 MIN)</p><p>NE/MIA (49 MIN)</p><p>CHI/LAR (51 MIN)</p><p>LV/BAL (52 MIN)</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
