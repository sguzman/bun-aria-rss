  "description": "Whether it's a goldfish or Grandma, every child will experience a death at some point — and their parents will likely struggle to explain it. <br/><br/>Here's what to remember:<br/>- Be honest and concrete. The cat wasn't put to sleep, and Grandma didn't go on a long journey.<br/>- Don't overwhelm kids with too much information. They need time to process.<br/>- Make sure kids know they're still surrounded by people who will love and support them.<br/>- Don't be afraid to show emotion.<br/>- When it comes to deathbed visits or funerals, tell kids what they might see and give them a choice.<br/>- Keep the hope alive!
