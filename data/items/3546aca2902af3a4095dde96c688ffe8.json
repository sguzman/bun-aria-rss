  "description": "<p>Music, a language that everyone understands, has been used in rituals across cultures throughout time. This podcast reviews how music and sound affect the brain to bring feelings of reward, analgesic (painkilling) effects and more. This bonus episode includes an introduction to and a sample of the sounds of Quartz Crystal Singing Bowls which are used for healing in complementary medicine. My guest for this episode is T Love who is only one of a handful of Vibrational Sound Therapists in the world certified to both teach and play Quartz Crystal Singing Bowls specifically for healing purposes. T, the host of the award winning Energy Awareness Radio, is the founder and CEO of the Sojihuggles Children’s Foundation, a nonprofit whose mission is to provide basic necessities for underprivileged children and is only run only by volunteers.
