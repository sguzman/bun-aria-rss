  "description": "<p>As authorities continue to unravel the enigmatic, at-times disturbing life of Jeffrey Alan Lash, they dig into what little is known about his past, seeking to uncover answers. How did he get all those weapons? What about all that hard currency? In the course of their investigation, they begin to notice a pattern: Lash seemed to be targeting people, turning them into supporters of his vague mission -- and, at times, threatening them if they refused to give him funding and lodging. His claims had begun to evolve into a sort of self-perpetuated mythology, wherein he was a sort of superhuman antihero, fighting the forces of darkness in an ongoing war of which the public was unaware. Some of his followers thought he would marry them, some thought he would help them become aliens. No one was sure exactly what was going to happen next.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p><a href=\"https://static.macmillan.com/static/fib/stuff-you-should-read/\" rel=\"payment\">They don't want you to read our book.: https://static.macmillan.com/static/fib/stuff-you-should-read/</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
