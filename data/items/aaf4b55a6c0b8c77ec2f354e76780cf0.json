  "description": "When it comes to the marriage of food and fashion, there’s no one like Rachel Antonoff. Prawns, pasta, bagels, and ice cream sundaes are just some of the deliciousness that’s made its way onto Rachel’s skirts, sweaters, dresses, and pajamas. The Brooklyn-based indie fashion designer joins host Kerry Diamond to talk about her family, business, and creative process. Learn why she loves a conversation print and what she calls “the internal giggle,” and how she’s responding to changes in the fashion industry. \n\nThank you to Free People for supporting this episode. Radio Cherry Bombe is recorded at Newsstand Studios at Rockefeller Center in New York City. Our theme song is by the band Tra La La. \n",
