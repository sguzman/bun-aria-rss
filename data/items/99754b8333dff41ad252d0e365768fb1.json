  "description": "The path of inflation over the past two years looks strikingly similar to the path observed during the 1970s,\nwhen the Federal Open Market Committee shifted its focus away from fighting inflation before price\npressures were fully under control. Although policymakers in both the 1970s and today have faced\nextraordinary challenges, future perceptions of current policy will likely be defined primarily by the\noutcome of the Committeeâ€™s attempts to curb inflation, rather than the circumstances surrounding it.",
