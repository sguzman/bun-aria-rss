  "description": "In August of 2009, a 15-year-old girl left home to hang out with friends in a neighboring Wisconsin town, and never returned. Her brother's 24-year-old friend had actually been the last person to see her, claiming to have dropped her off at the home of her ex-boyfriend. But her ex-boyfriend claims they didn’t even have plans to see each other. So which of these men is lying? Or was it someone else entirely?
