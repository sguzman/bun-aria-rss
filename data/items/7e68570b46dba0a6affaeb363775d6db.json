  "description": "<p>For our final podcast of 2020, we thought it would be nice to speak with the most positive entrepreneur we know, Emshika Alberini. Driven by her sense of adventure and curiosity, Emshika left her family in Bangkok and struck out on her own in the U.S., journeying from au pair to celebrated restaurateur. She’s faced heartbreak and unspeakable loss, yet she has never lost her belief in the power of love and kindness. Today, Emshika is the owner of Chang Thai Cafe in Littleton, New Hampshire, and the creative force behind the By Emshika beverage line. She was named to the Cherry Bombe 100 in 2018, and has won numerous accolades for her work on behalf of the New Hampshire business and restaurant community. Emshika joins us to talk about her family, her 2021 resolutions, and the power of positivity. </p><p>Thank you to Kerrygold for supporting Radio Cherry Bombe.</p>\n",
