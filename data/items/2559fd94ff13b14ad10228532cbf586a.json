  "description": "<p>Is the pandemic changing how you lead your organization? That’s the question we asked C-Suite executives at five different companies in this mini episode of the Being Human is Good for Business podcast. </p><p>Over the past several months we’ve interviewed dozens of executive leaders from a broad range of businesses and social impact organizations. Yet, we seldom had a discussion that didn’t touch upon how the pandemic has changed how we lead and work.</p><p>For Bret Furio, CEO of Canidae, the pet food company, learning to see the positive in constantly changing circumstances helped him as a leader.  He says, “I’m learning to be more generous in terms of work life balance and being flexible about work arrangements. It lets people do what works best for them, and allows them to still contribute greatly.” </p><p>Carnegie Mellon University CFO Angela Blanton told us how the pandemic had taught her the importance of building trusting relationships, of taking more time to make decisions, and to be a lot more flexible.  She says, “I am learning to back up and let my leaders lead. I’m trying to not make any decisions too quickly so that we can be flexible when we need to shift direction.” </p><p>The former president of International Brake Industries (IBI), Paul Johnson, told us how his team has been able to innovate under difficult circumstances.  He says that learning to work through the pandemic has raised their level of innovation. </p><p>EA’s Vice President of Worldwide Customer Experience Joel Knutson told us his organization has been able to pivot, thanks to increased investment in the health and wellbeing of the team.  He explains, “We’re flexing up our empathy, significantly. We’re flexing to focus on employee needs and are rolling out additional benefits to all our employees.” </p><p>When we spoke to Misan Rewane, the former CEO of the Nigerian social enterprise Wave Academies, she told us how the pandemic is teaching her to hold space for her people while they are work as virtual team. She says, “It’s the simple things like starting a call by genuinely listening as people tell you how they really are.” </p><p>Watch for future mini episodes where we’ll bring you highlights from all our past shows.  To hear the full interview with the leaders featured in today’s show download these episodes: </p><p>Episode 6:  <a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/blog/accelerate-business-growth?rq=bret%20furio\">Interview with Bret Furio:How Leaders Can Accelerate Business Growth</a></p><p>Episode 7: <a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/blog/podcast-lessons-from-the-c-suite-my-first-year?rq=angela\">Lessons from the C-Suite: My First Year</a></p><p>Episode 10: <a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/blog/podcast-creating-connections?rq=paul%20\">Creating Connections Beyond the Org Chart</a></p><p>Episode 11: <a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/blog/podcast-ea\">Electronic Arts’ People-Centered Approach to Business</a></p><p>Episode 21: <a href=\"https://www.trilogyeffect.com/blog/podcast-creating-a-wave-of-positive-impact-for-nigerian-youths?rq=misan\">Creating a WAVE of Positive Impact for Nigerian Youth</a></p><p>We invite you to subscribe to the Being Human Is Good for Business Podcast on iTunes, Amazon, Google Podcasts, iHeart Radio, and Spotify (links below) or wherever you get your podcasts.
