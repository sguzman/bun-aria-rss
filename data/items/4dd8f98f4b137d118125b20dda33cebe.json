We're re-releasing one of our favorite past episodes - Gods Salvation Church about a Dallas-based doomsday cult and it's rise and fall in one of our local suburbs.\nAfter checking out this throwback episode, you can head over to our Patreon for some bonus content like our minisodes, mixed bags, and Wheel segments where we spin an actual game show wheel to determine what we're going to talk about!\nThanks so much and keep it creepy!\nOn the brink of the new millennium, one man claims to know the day God will return to Earth...and He's doing it on a spaceship. When he and the rest of the UFOlogy cult take up residence in a Texas suburb, decked out in all white and cowboy hats, officials fear they may have a Heaven's Gate situation on their hands. Will it end as badly as everyone thinks, or will Hon-Ming Chen turn out to be just another false prophet?\nSupport Sinisterhood\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
