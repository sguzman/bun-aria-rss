  "description": "Dave Dameshek is joined by \"Handsome\" Hank who fills in for Adam Rank, who is on assignment, with guest producer \"Neck-tie\" Milner. The trio open a can of worms on the best two-topping pizzas. Dave, as always, shows his age-ism by downplaying pineapple as well as the \"scam\" of hair conditioner. And by the way, half of the ATL debate club, Marc Sessler, joins the cast to share his list of the top quarterbacks in the league, much to the chagrin of Dave and Hank. Finally, Shek and Hank share their excitement for Super Bowl L in San Francisco as they prepare their restaurant checklist years in advance. \n      <p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
