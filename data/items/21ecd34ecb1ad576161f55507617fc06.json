  "description": "<p>Ever wonder why the exact same touch by one person will give you the creeps, but by another will make you yearn for more?</p><p>On this episode of <em>The Good Life,</em> I am excited to bring you David Linden, a Johns Hopkins Neuroscientist and <em>New York Times</em> best-selling author of&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.amazon.com/Touch-Science-Hand-Heart-Mind/dp/0670014877\" target=\"_blank\"><em>Touch: The Science of Hand, Heart, and Mind</em></a>.</p><p>The research that David has been conducting on the effects of touch on the human mind is a powerful reminder of the role touch plays in nearly every aspect of human development. Everything from love to intelligence, sex to attachment, orgasm or itch and beyond... basically, anything we touch or get touched by profoundly influences our personality, perception of people and the world.</p><p>Whether touch is given or withheld at any age can shape the entirety of our beings. Our neurology, psychology and our ability to live functional, good lives is dependent on touch.</p><p>If you have ever wondered why touch is so important to the development of infants, or why we find touch so vital to our own mental well-being, you are going to want to turn up the volume and listen in.
