  "description": "When the behaviors we thought would make us happy don’t, we’re forced to bridge the gap between where we are and where we want to be. But our happiness goals are often stifled by the disease of addiction—and its complex neurochemical influence on our desires. \nA conversation with psychiatrist Anna Lembke helps us understand the gap between the cravings that drive us and the happiness we seek. \nThis episode was produced by Rebecca Rashid and is hosted by Arthur Brooks. Editing by A.C. Valdez and Claudine Ebeid. Fact-check by Ena Alvarado. Engineering by Matthew Simonson. \nBe a part of How to Build a Happy Life. Write to us at howtopodcast@theatlantic.com.
