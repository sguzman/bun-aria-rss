Then, interstate commerce has been affected but there are questions over who has the authority to re-open states. Federal authority does not supersede state authority unless it’s an issue of federal legislation to regulate interstate commerce. Later, politicians like Barack Obama and Joe Biden have made lots of money in the private sector, yet they take FDR-styled policy positions, to the contrary. Afterward, our debt crisis has been ignored and must stop.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
