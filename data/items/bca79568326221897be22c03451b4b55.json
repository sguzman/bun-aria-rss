My main problem I had was that I kept giving it breaks because it's older, which is fine to a degree. But I do wish I would have expanded more on the idea that the towns in this game were a little more self contained than I hoped they would be. They were good additions in and of themselves, but the interactions between most of them were non-existent. Additionally, I do think I called out \"modern games\" a bit too much, and wish I had provided some examples of what I was talking about. Unfortunately, I stumbled a bit there, and I'll try to do better in the future.\n\nThanks for watching!",
