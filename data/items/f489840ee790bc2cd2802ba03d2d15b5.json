  "title": "Ep 111 | Refugee: 'American Wokeism Worse Than North Korea' | Yeonmi Park | The Glenn Beck Podcast",
  "description": "Yeonmi Park experienced freedom for the first time at 13, when she watched \"Titanic.\" She didn’t see it in a plush movie theater seat; she watched it over the course of several days because electricity is sporadic in North Korea, where she grew up. \"We don’t have a word for oppression,\" Yeonmi tells Glenn. “There is no hope. There is no moving forward. You are doomed.” Against unbelievable odds, Yeonmi escaped and eventually made it to New York City. Then, she went to Columbia University, where she couldn't believe how American students defined \"oppression.\" She and Glenn discuss the ridiculousness of pronoun checks, the consequences of White House-led censorship, the importance of the Second Amendment, the authoritarianism of Big Tech, and the insanity of corporations’ love affair with China. But even more shockingly, she explains her fear that where her new country is heading could be worse than what she escaped: “Even North Korea wasn’t as crazy as American wokeism.”\n\t\nSponsor:\n\nBuilt Bar - Staying healthy is tough, especially if you have a sweet tooth.
