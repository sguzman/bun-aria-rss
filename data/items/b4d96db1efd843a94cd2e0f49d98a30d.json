  "description": "<p>Brendan just released his stand up special on Show Time and has a new podcast with Theo Von. He's always a great guest on Rogan's show and this conversation is another example of that. He's done so much great work since his time in the UFC and it's very motivating to hear what he's achieved.</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Enjoy my review folks!</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Please email me with any suggestions and questions for future shows :</p>\n <p> </p>\n <p>Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com</p>\n <p> </p>\n",
