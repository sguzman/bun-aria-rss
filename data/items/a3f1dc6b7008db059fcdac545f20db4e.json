  "description": "Speaker of the House Nancy Pelosi’s trip to Taiwan was unexpected. Accused of recklessness, dissuaded by Biden, cheered by McConnell, it was risky. What’s the possible reward? We are joined by Asia experts Neil Thomas from The Eurasia Group and Professor David Kang from USC, for an extended discussion on what the heck Nancy was doing. And while Madame Speaker is in the crosshairs of one of the world’s scariest military forces, her husband Paul is in the crosshairs of Fox News. Plus, Alex Jones under oath, and out of control.\nProduced by Joel Patterson and Corey Wara\nEmail us at thegist@mikepesca.com\nTo advertise on the show, visit: https://advertisecast.com/TheGist\nLearn more about your ad choices.
