  "description": "We never wanted a hall pass for Zack Morris but our thirst for Mark-Paul Gosselaar grew from a tiny acorn into a mighty oak — JUST LIKE HE DID. From Pitch to the Passage, we explore what makes MPG the MVP: is it the well-groomed beard? The thick thighs? Or maybe the fact that he’s starred opposite so many black women and girls that’s got our foofs a-tingle…\nThis week on Fanfic Wars, MPG saves Nichole, relaxes with Bim after a fan convention. Plus [REDACTED] as usual.\nFollow us on Twitter @ThirstAidKit. Nichole is @tnwhiskeywoman and Bim is @bimadew. Find show notes, gifs, and links on our Tumblr at thirstaidkitpodcast.tumblr.com.
