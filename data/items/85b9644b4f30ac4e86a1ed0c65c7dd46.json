  "description": "<p>There were a lot of new cigars and line extensions for national distribution at the 2018 IPCPR show in Las Vegas and we had hoped to get to them last week and discuss what Dave bought that will be coming to his stores soon. We never got to them, but it makes for another show so here we go and we will let you know what to expect in the coming weeks and months.</p>\n<p>We will also discuss food and what Dave enjoyed while in Las Vegas and he will tell us about the new project he just started that ties into food. So much for the diet, but the show must go on or in this case the shows must go on.</p>\n<p>In the first hour we will light up the Aganorsa Connecticut which is one of the new products we will have on our shelves in the near future and we will share our thoughts with you and let you know why it made the cut.</p>\n<p>In the second hour we will light up a cigar from the care package that might of had you scratching your head. I thought Dave was crazy until I lit one up and we hope you feel the same way as we light up the Villager Kiel Brazil.</p>\n<p>We also have the usual suspects such as Versus, Offer Of The Day, Asylum, Classic 3-Way and Cigar News on the number one downloaded cigar podcast in the world.</p>\n<p>The Cigar Authority is a member of the United Podcast Network and is recorded live in front of a studio audience at Studio 21 Podcast Cafe upstairs at Two Guys Smoke Shop in Salem, NH and as always you can find many of the cigars we discuss at http://www.2GuysCigars.com/.</p>\n",
