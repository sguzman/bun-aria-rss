  "title": "PMS 2.0 173 - 17 Year NFL QB Josh McCown & 3 Time, 3 Time Super Bowl Champion Mark Schlereth Stop By. NIT Podcast Bracket Is Out, Let's GO!",
  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys chat about Charlie Weis going on record and stating that he and \"Tommy\" Brady have been texting one another and that Tom doesn't know where he's going and neither does anyone else, so he wants everyone to slow down. Pat discusses Charlie Weis being Tom Brady's mouthpiece and what that means, as well as the implications league wide if Brady signs with the San Francisco 49ers. Also joining the show is 3x Super Bowl Champ, 2x Pro Bowler, chili mogul, and friend of the show, Mark \"Stink\" Schlereth. Pat and Mark chat about his thoughts on Tom Brady and how he sees a very real possibility&nbsp;that Brady doesn't end up back in New England, what he thinks about Charlie Weis being Tom Brady's new spokesman, his take on the CBA negotiations and what he thinks will happen there, and details why health insurance is so important to retired players as he has had 20+ surgeries, and whether or not he is still punking kids in the weight room (17:08-34:43). Pat also gives his thoughts on last weekend's Lakers/Clippers game and the guys chat about why LeBron is so great, whether or not the Lakers are the team to beat this year, and why that brand of basketball is so fun to watch, and Pat reacts to the Podcast NIT bracket being released and what he thinks about PMI's chances. Also included is a Youtube question to Pat about what his greater achievement was, the hit on Trindon Holliday, or recovering his own onside kick in Houston. Later, 17 year NFL veteran, a man who has played Quarterback for 11 teams most recently with the Eagles, and incredible basketball player, Josh McCown joins the program. Josh and Pat chat about him tearing the hamstring off the bone in the Eagles playoff loss to the Seahawks and what that rehab process is like, how he finished the game, and how badly it hurt. Josh also gives his take on the CBA negotiations as he went through it last time around, chats about his basketball game, being a high school football coach during the season, how he keeps his hair looking so good, and what's in store for his future (50:36-1:07:21). Today's a good one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
