  "title": "BONUS 11 - The Amityville Horror",
  "description": "<p>At roughly 3:00 AM, Nov. 13, 1974, twenty three year old Ronald Joseph \"Butch\" DeFeo Jr took a thirty-five caliber Marlin rifle and executed all six members of entire immediate family in their sleep at the family home on 112 Ocean Avenue in Amityville, Long Island. Strangely, all were found lying in their beds with no signs of a struggle. How did the rifle not wake five of them up after the first victim was shot? A little over a year later the Lutz family moved into the same home and 28 days later left their belongings inside and fled what they believed was physical and psychological torment at the hands of evil, paranormal entities. What really happened at Amityville? 100% truth? 100% hoax? Or somewhere in the middle?
