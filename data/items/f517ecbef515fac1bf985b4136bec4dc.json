  "description": "<div style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> <p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Today we are so excited to introduce an impactful, two-part series. As you may know, this coming Monday, we get to celebrate the great life and legacy of Dr. Martin Luther King. Jr. So, our team decided we would celebrate Dr. King on the podcast by sharing this lesson that John Maxwell gave at Ebenezer Baptist Church, where Dr. King pastored and influenced so many people to create positive change in our country. John was especially honored to have Coretta Scott King and Bernice King present for this talk, along with many other influential world changers. During this talk, John uses Dr. King’s life as an example of how great leaders can create positive change. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p> </div> <div style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> <p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">During the application portion of this episode, Mark Cole and Traci Morrow reflect on John’s lesson and the legacy of Martin Luther King Jr. They discuss how MLK was the shining example of a leader who listens and inspires others to create positive change. More than ever before, the world needs leaders like Martin Luther King Jr., and we hope this episode will inspire you to create positive change in your own world. </span><span data-ccp-props=\"{}\"> </span></p> </div> <div style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> <p><span data-contrast=\"auto\">Our BONUS resource for this series is the Creating Positive Change Worksheet, which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching.
