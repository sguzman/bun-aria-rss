That’s why we’re always working to make your device more helpful, including giving you easier ways to find what you need — and keep your day running smoothly.</p><p data-block-key=\"eabvd\">Widgets for Google apps are a big part of how we do that. Our<a href=\"https://blog.google/products/google-on-ios/customize-your-lock-screen-with-google-apps-in-ios-16/\">Lock Screen widgets for iOS 16</a> are officially available, so you can access features from your favorite Google apps with a quick tap or even just a glance at your iPhone Lock Screen. Between these and our <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/google-on-ios/bring-best-google-your-iphone-13/\">Home Screen widgets</a>, we’ve got you covered across all your favorite Google apps.</p><p data-block-key=\"b5b3i\">Let’s take a closer look at ways you can use all these new widgets.</p><h2 data-block-key=\"2vjs6\">Customize your Lock Screen for work and play</h2><p data-block-key=\"e0e7q\">Set up a separate Lock Screen to stay focused during the workday. The Gmail widget can automatically show you the number of new messages since you last opened your inbox and which categories they're in, helping you stay on top of emails even if you’re heads down on a project. And with our Drive widgets, you can open a suggested or starred file in just one tap.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"h-c-page\"><div class=\"article-image h-c-grid__col--10 h-c-grid__col--offset-1 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-l--8\"><a class=\"article-image--link\"><img alt=\"An iPhone Lock Screen with a photo of a bridge and the Gmail and Drive Lock Screen widgets.
