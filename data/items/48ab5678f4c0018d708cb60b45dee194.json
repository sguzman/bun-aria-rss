  "description": "**Bruegel fellow Georg Zachmann joins Richard Tol, professor in the Department of Economics at the University of Sussex, and Pieter-Willem Lemmens, head of analysis at the climate policy think-tank Sandbag, for this episode of 'The Sound of Economics', to discuss the impact of Brexit on climate and energy policy in the European Union**\n\nBritain's departure from the European Union poses questions not only for the EU energy market, but the bloc-wide climate-change targets and emissions trading system.\n\nPresented by Sean Gibson, edited by Giuseppe Porcaro\n\nIn the energy context, Brexit not only marks the separation of Britain from the EU but also places Ireland in a uniquely difficult position, having previously utilised infrastructure in Britain to connect to the rest of the EU.\n\nOn the matter of climate change, the loss of Britain might make it more difficult for Europe to meet current targets, and set further ambitious goals for the future.\n\nIn this episode of 'The Sound of Economics', senior Bruegel fellow Georg Zachmann joins the conversation with Richard Tol, professor in the Department of Economics at the University of Sussex, and Pieter-Willem Lemmens, head of analysis at the climate policy think-tank Sandbag.\n\nGeorg Zachmann co-authored a research paper in November 2017 for the European Parliament’s Committee on Industry, Research and Energy, about the impact of Brexit on the Irish energy system - also writing a Bruegel blog post on the same topic. More recently Georg has written an opinion piece on how climate-change policies risk increasing social inequality.",
