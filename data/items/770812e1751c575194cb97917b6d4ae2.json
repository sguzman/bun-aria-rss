  "description": "<p><p>On this week's episode, the guys are joined by King Clancy Memorial Trophy Nominee Jason Zucker for an NHL Awards themed episode. Jason talks about the past year in Minnesota, playing with the team his whole career, who the funny guys are in the locker room and more. The boys then give their NHL awards predictions. From the Hart Trophy to the Jack Adams, the guys break down all the awards and give their predictions as to who will win each one. Ryan is also convinced that Pavel Bure wears number 94 while Grinnelli's landlord comes barging in mid episode. A great episode to kick of NHL awards week and the offseason.</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
