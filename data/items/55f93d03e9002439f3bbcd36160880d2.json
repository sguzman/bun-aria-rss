  "description": "<p>Recently, Rattan and the first author (Ann. Comb. 25 (2021) 697-728) proved a\nconjectured inequality of Berkovich and Uncu (Ann. Comb. 23 (2019) 263-284)\nconcerning partitions with an impermissible part. In this article, we\ngeneralize this inequality upon considering t impermissible parts. We compare\nthese with partitions whose certain parts appear with a frequency which is a\nperfect t^{th} power. Our inequalities hold after a certain bound, which for\ngiven t is a polynomial in s, a major improvement over the previously known\nbound in the case t=1. To prove these inequalities, our methods involve\nconstructing injective maps between the relevant sets of partitions. The\nconstruction of these maps crucially involves concepts from analysis and\ncalculus, such as explicit maps used to prove countability of N^t, and Jensen's\ninequality for convex functions, and then merge them with techniques from\nnumber theory such as Frobenius numbers, congruence classes, binary numbers and\nquadratic residues. We also show a connection of our results to colored\npartitions. Finally, we pose an open problem which seems to be related to power\nresidues and the almost universality of diagonal ternary quadratic forms.\n</p>",
