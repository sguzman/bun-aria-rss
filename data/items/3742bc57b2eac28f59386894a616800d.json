  "description": "<p>Cameron Crowe's teenage years are familiar to anyone who's seen his autobiographical <em>Almost Famous</em>: 16-year-old writing prodigy convinces Jan Wenner and <em>Rolling Stone</em> to let him tour with and profile the greatest rock musicians of his generation. But what came after is just as interesting: going undercover as a high-school student to write <em>Fast Times at Ridgemont High</em>; falling into the <em>Say Anything </em>director's chair after the two first choices turned it down; hanging out with Led Zeppelin to get their blessing of the songs in <em>Almost Famous</em>. Crowe and Alec are friends, and it comes through in their affectionate back-and-forth about movies, writing, family, and the bands they love. And throughout this extended interview are interspersed some great tunes that demonstrate how Crowe is a master of the \"needle-drop,\" using music to further the story, character development, and dramatic tension of his films.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
