  "description": "Former NBA star Dwyane Wade wants us to admire his good parenting because he's allowing his son to become his daughter. But this is precisely the opposite of good parenting, to put it mildly. Also, are Dems really on the verge of nominating an 80 year old communist? And should we teach our kids to fight fire with fire against bullies, or \"be the bigger person\"?\n\nCheck out The Cold War: What We Saw, a new podcast written and presented by Bill Whittle at https://www.dailywire.com/coldwar. In Part 1 we peel back the layers of mystery cloaking the Terror state run by the Kremlin, and watch as America takes its first small steps onto the stage of world leadership.\n\nIf you like The Matt Walsh Show, become a member TODAY with promo code: WALSH and enjoy the exclusive benefits for 10% off at https://www.dailywire.com/Walsh\nLearn more about your ad choices.
