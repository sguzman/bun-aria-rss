  "description": "Daniel and I start today’s show by discussing the biggest risk to the market: inflation. While some data shows inflation is peaking, we break down why consumers will see elevated prices for a while. Next, we highlight the government’s blame-shifting narrative around inflation and soaring costs… what’s really driving higher food and energy prices (hint: it’s not Putin)... and the best way to bring prices back down. And we explain why you don’t need to wait for a market bottom to start picking away at the best stocks. We also discuss the Securities & Exchange Commission’s (SEC) proposed changes to “payment for order flow”... and whether this game-changing proposal is good or bad for individual investors. Finally, I share why I believe Bitcoin will go over $100k. In this episode:  It’s time to start picking away at great stocks [1:05] Government leaders are shifting the blame for higher prices [3:45] The real cause of—and solution for—soaring food and energy costs [11:00]  Big market changes could be coming from the SEC [17:05] Why I’m bullish on Bitcoin [25:35]  Enjoyed this episode?
