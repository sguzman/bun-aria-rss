  "description": "It's not news that some of the top government agencies and companies in the world were victims of the SolarWinds attack. At this point, I can say it's the reason I didn't have a smoother transition back into work-life following a long vacation. As I understand it, the breaches happened after malicious code was inserted into a software patch that was downloaded by the companies and agencies. The installation of the patch executed malicious code, called SUNBURST, which created an entry point for other malicious codes (TEARDROP/RAINDROP). These additional codes were used to allow attackers to move laterally within the network and exfiltrate sensitive customer information to a public command and control server.",
