The team hears why an anomaly concerning a quark could hint at a crack in our understanding of physics. They also find out whether the age-defying, rejuvenating properties of human embryos can help us reset the ageing process in adults. As the <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/2271907-perseverances-first-month-on-mars-has-yielded-new-sights-and-sounds/'>Perseverance rover has been on Mars for a month now</a>, there is of course more news from our neighbouring planet, namely new recordings from the surface to listen to, and the upcoming launch of the Ingenuity helicopter. Also on the pod is the worrying story of <a href='https://www.newscientist.com/article/2272162-europeans-get-cold-feet-over-covid-19-vaccines-as-third-wave-hits/'>vaccine hesitancy in the EU</a>, and the team celebrates a microbe unlike anything seen before.
