  "description": "To celebrate Thanksgiving on this podcast, our staff is talking about what we're thankful for -- including the quilting communities we're all connected to and appreciate! If you're planning on making your Christmas list or Black Friday shopping, we're also sharing a few products that we’re loving right now including fork pins, which we've actually received a lot of questions about from our readers! And we're also sharing some tips for zippers, which may come in handy if you eat a little too much on Thanksgiving. And on Getting Sewcial, we chat with Latifah Saafir, who talks about her new Quilt Cadets program, which is a line of products and patterns for kids who sew. If you have children or grandkids in your life, you'll definitely want to check this out!\n\nFor more resources from today's show, visit the show notes here.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
