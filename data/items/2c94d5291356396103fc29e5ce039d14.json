  "description": "<p>On today's show, the guys all chat about what they did on their vacations and try not to get too distracted as they sit through a shoot out in the Euros and the beginning of \"The Match\" between Aaron Rodgers/Bryson Dechambeau and Tom Brady/Phil Mickelson. They also dive into a loaded Pod FOD that includes them tip-toeing around what happens in Fast 9 as not everyone has seen it yet, Adam Driver's new movie where he will make film history, robots starting to feel pain in an attempt to teach them empathy, all the different movies and TV shows that they've been watching and keep their eyes on, the appearance of goth Tony, Ben Affleck and JLo continuing their PDA run, homeless guys pooping in mop buckets on the subway, and much much more. Don't forget to subscribe to the Youtube page to watch clips and full episodes of the show, and keep sending your submissions to the Pod FOD to @ThePodPMI on Twitter and Instagram. We appreciate you all for listening, we'll see you Friday.</p>\n",
