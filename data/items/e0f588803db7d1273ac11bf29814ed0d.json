Fittingly, the two songs discussed that day formed their own kind of syzygy. Kesha's \"Praying\" and Imagine Dragon's \"Believer\" are inverse anthems of resilience. Both tracks seek catharsis - one through prayer, the other through pain.\nFeaturingKesha - Tik TokKesha - PrayingMozart - The Queen of the Night AriaWhitney Houston - I Will Always Love YouMariah Carey - EmotionsLalah Hathaway - SomethingImagine Dragons - RadioactiveImagine Dragons - Believer\nLearn more about your ad choices.
