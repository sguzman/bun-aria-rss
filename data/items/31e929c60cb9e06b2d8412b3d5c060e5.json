  "description": "<p>We spend this entire episode covering what you should do with your tax refund! First of all, you shouldn't be receiving a big refund when April 15th rolls around- if you are, talk to HR and have your tax withholding decreased so the IRS is taking a smaller bite out of your paycheck. We would rather see you proactively do something with that money on a regular basis as opposed to waiting on that 'windfall' once a year. So do that first. Next, here are the top 5 things you need to be doing with your tax refund:</p><p>Pay off high interest debt - any debt with an interest rate approaching double digits, or higher, wipe it out.Emergency fund - at least have $1000 for an emergency fund, preferably 3-6 months of living expenses.Invest it - put that money to work whether it be in a 401k, real estate, or small business!Give it to charity - be generous. Check out Give.org and become a better giver.Treat yo self - but avoid those pony expenses.And at the beginning of this episode we popped open a barrel aged saison- Joie by Westbrook Brewing which you can find and learn all about on Untappd.
