The most common answer is ln|x|+C. This is a more satisfying answer than just ln(x)+C without absolute values because the domain of ln|x| and 1/x match (all real numbers except zero).  However, this still isn't quite right as the indefinite integral is defined as ALL anti-derivatives. The slightly pedantic full answer is all piecewise defined functions that look like ln(x)+C for x bigger than 0 and ln(-x)+D for x smaller than 0, that is having different constants on both sides of the hole in the domain. This still satisfies a corollary of the Mean Value Theorem that asserts any two anti-derivatives differ by at most a constant provided we are on an open interval, which is what happens on each side of x=0.
