  "description": "Today we’re thrilled to announce that I’ve created an audio course for those looking to explore the world of Renaissance Europe through the eyes of the women artists who thrived there. This course is called “Breaking Barriers: Women Artists of Renaissance Europe,” a 21-day course, broken up into daily episodes that are no longer than 10 minutes. And naturally, there are no pesky term papers or final exams to worry about-- just cool art history content that you won’t find anywhere else. \nIn this course, you'll get the satisfaction of learning about the Renaissance in-depth and with a greater capacity for understanding the limits and barriers to women seeking to work professionally in one of the most colorful eras of Western history. You'll become familiar with artists you've probably never heard of, all of whom made an incredible mark on art, but unlike traditional ArtCurious episodes, you'll be getting more content on a more frequent basis. In fact, you'll be getting an episode every day for three weeks. But just because you're getting a daily influx of information doesn't mean that it will be overwhelming because each episode will only be up to 10 minutes in length. You'll get to enjoy fun, information-packed audio that won't take a big bite out of your day. \nWe need to confirm there’s enough interest before production of this fantastic course starts, so if you’re a fan of ArtCurious and want to do something to support, sign up right now for “Breaking Barriers: Women Artists of Renaissance Europe” at avid.fm/jennifer. Register by June 7 for a special early buy-in price of just $21.99– and if we get enough interest the course will be available soon. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
