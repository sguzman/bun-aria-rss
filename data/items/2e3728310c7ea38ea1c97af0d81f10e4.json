  "description": "Everyone talks about the “terrible twos,” but we rarely acknowledge the tricky twelve- to twenty-four-month stage. At one year, kids are rapidly developing: They’re exploring the world, figuring out how to express their needs, and testing limits. It’s messy, but here’s the thing: The more prepared you are for this stage, the more grounded you can be in those messy moments. In this week’s episode, Dr. Becky talks with three parents about the challenges of raising a one-year-old—from throwing food to throwing a tantrum. She emphasizes that our kids are not trying to irritate us, they’re trying to learn, and shares practical strategies for helping them learn in a safe environment.\n\nJoin Good Inside Membership: https://bit.ly/3cqgG2A  \nFollow Dr. Becky on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drbeckyatgoodinside \nSign up for our weekly email, Good Insider: https://www.goodinside.com/newsletter\nPre-order Dr. Becky's upcoming book, Good Inside: A Guide to Becoming the Parent You Want to Be: www.goodinside.com/book or wherever you order your books.",
