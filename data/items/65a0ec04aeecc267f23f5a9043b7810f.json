  "description": "<p>Tonight I will be welcoming Jeremey to the show. He describes activity around his property and finding tracks. A little bit later, Jeremey and his friend decided to go camping not far from his property and something roared at them. They left all of their camping supplies behind and left as fast as they could. They decided to go back and get all of the camping gear the next day and found tracks of something very large, Jeremey said “It looked like a human track but just on a large scale.”</p> <p>They decided the next day they would follow where the tracks were going. They came up into an area in the woods when all hell broke loose. Jeremey said “as we came around the corner we could hear talking but it sounded like gibberish than everything went silent….something screamed at us and it came from three different directions and whatever these things were they started knocking trees over.</p> <p>We ran and I have never ran this fast in my life as we came down the trail this thing stood up on the side of the trail and I could see it from the chest up and it was huge. It wasn’t a monkey or human I wasn’t sure what it was but it was about 10 feet from me and it screamed at me. I really thought I was dead….”</p> <p>The incident took place in Maine.</p>",
