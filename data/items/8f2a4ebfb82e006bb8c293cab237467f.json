  "description": "<p>PLAY MORE CHESS AND LESS CHECKERS. We always make fun of dogs chasing their tails. It’s funny to watch- they spin and spin and spin trying to catch the impossible. They eventually flop onto the ground exhausted. What’s the “tail” you are chasing? You probably think something will change when you finally catch that thing that is just out of reach, but the reality is that it probably won’t. I’ve accomplished so many goals that ultimately left me feeling empty. Stop spinning around reaching for things that won’t ultimately bring you happiness. Instead, focus on the process and the impact you have on others.  On today’s episode of The School of Greatness, I talk about figuring out what really matters with a King of New York hospitality: Eugene Remm. Eugene Remm is an entrepreneur and wellness expert whose companies include Catch Hospitality Group (Catch Restaurants, Lexington Brass) and the boxing-inspired group fitness concept Rumble. Forbes Magazine dubbed him one of the “New Kings of New York Hospitality.”  Eugene has been able to leverage social media in truly innovative ways by staying ahead of trends and being authentic. He had to learn through failure to be a team player. He now teaches that looking out for the benefit of all benefits you as well.
