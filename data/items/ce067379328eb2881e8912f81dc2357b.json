  "description": "<div>In warm weather, Bournemouth on the south coast of England is a nice place to spend some time.Â  On the summer evening when we join the story, 26 year old Jong-Ok Shin was walking home from a Bournemouth nightclub, and just metres from the door of her home when she was attacked and she tragically died from her injuries. There were no witnesses to this crime.<br>\n<br>\nShortly afterwards, local drug addict Omar Benguit was arrested and convicted of murder and over 20 years later he is still in prison. But was he guilty of this dreadful crime?<br>\n<br>\n<br>\n<strong>Sources:</strong>\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2014/690.html\">http://www.bailii.org/ew/cases/EWCA/Crim/2014/690.html</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.homepage-link.to/justice/judgements/benguit/Scan%2018.pdf\">http://www.homepage-link.to/justice/judgements/benguit/Scan%2018.pdf</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.thejusticegap.com/omar-benguit-all-i-ever-wanted-was-the-truth-to-come-out-i-am-innocent/\">https://www.thejusticegap.com/omar-benguit-all-i-ever-wanted-was-the-truth-to-come-out-i-am-innocent/</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280658448_A_Briefing_Paper_on_Issues_and_Events_Surrounding_the_Omar_Benguit_Case_Charminster_and_the_Murder_of_Jong_Oki_Shin_12th_July_2002\">https://www.researchgate.net/publication/280658448_A_Briefing_Paper_on_Issues_and_Events_Surrounding_the_Omar_Benguit_Case_Charminster_and_the_Murder_of_Jong_Oki_Shin_12th_July_2002</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"https://thetab.com/uk/2021/05/05/unsolved-an-alibi-for-omar-benguit-true-crime-jong-ok-shin-case-204043\">https://thetab.com/uk/2021/05/05/unsolved-an-alibi-for-omar-benguit-true-crime-jong-ok-shin-case-204043</a></li>\n<li><a href=\"http://www.omarbenguit.co.uk/\">http://www.omarbenguit.co.uk/</a></li>\n</ul>\n",
