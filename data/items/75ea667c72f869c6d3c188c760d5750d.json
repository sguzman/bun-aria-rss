  "description": "<p>On November 22, 1963, John F. Kennedy, President of the United States, was assassinated in broad daylight in front of hundreds of people--at least 55 of whom were filming or taking pictures. And yet we still don't know what happened. Lee Harvey Oswald was the prime suspect. But then he too was killed in the middle of the day in front of almost 100 people.Â </p>\n\n\n<p>Was it a lone gunman? The CIA? Fidel Castro? And will we every know the truth? We have some thoughts.....</p>\n\n\n<p>This week's Palate Cleanser is from the 2004 Broadway Cast Recording of \"Assassins\" and features Neil Patrick Harris and Dennis O'Hare.</p>\n",
