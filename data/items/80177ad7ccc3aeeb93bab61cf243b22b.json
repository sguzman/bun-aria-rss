  "description": "<p>Jonah is called by God to go to Nineveh, the greatest city in the world, to warn the city about impending disaster and preach there. Jonah refuses, heads in the other direction, and gets on a boat. God sends a storm to hunt him down, endangering the lives of everyone on the ship. Jonah, recognizing this, offers to be thrown into the ocean so the lives of the other sailors will not be forfeit.</p>\n<p>We’re going to pause and look at the sub-plot here: Jonah’s impact on the sailors and their impact on him. God uses the sailors to teach Jonah something about himself and the world. In doing so, let’s take a look and see how God will teach us something about ourselves and how we are supposed to regard the world.</p>\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on August 5, 1990. Series: Jonah. Scripture: Jonah 1:4-16.</p>\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.
