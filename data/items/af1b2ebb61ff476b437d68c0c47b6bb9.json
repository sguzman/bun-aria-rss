  "description": "This week, we’re going behind the scenes of It’s Alive, our video series that chronicles Brad Leone's fermentation experiments (and adventures) and is edited by Matt Hunziker. It was a big leap from videos we used to make—less hands in pans, more humor—so Brad and Hunzi sit with Adam to talk about the series' evolution. After that, we're reading letters and comments we receive. A lot of them are nice, a few are mean, and some are constructive—the kind that we like to engage with. Finally, we're airing the first of a new recurring segment called Cook, Marry, Kill with senior staff writer Alex Beggs.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
