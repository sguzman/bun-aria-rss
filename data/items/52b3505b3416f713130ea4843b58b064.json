  "description": "<p>11-year-old Roman Lopez is not in bed when his stepmother goes to wake him for breakfast. At first, the stepmother thought the shy 4 feet-8 inch boy was just hiding. He liked to do that. When he couldn’t be found, a frantic search began. For two hours, Jordan and Lindsay Piper searched for Roman. After the boy is reported missing to police, more than 40 people from Jordan Piper’s place of work joined in the search. Police searched the home in case the boy was hiding. Neighbors helped police search properties and outbuilding. More than 250 fliers were printed and handed out in restaurants, bars, parks and businesses all over town. The search continued for more than 15 hours, and come nightfall Roman has still not been found. Police search the family home again. Lopez's body is found inside a storage bin in the basement. There is no obvious trauma but found he was severely malnourished and dehydrated. His father, Jordan Piper, and his stepmother, Lindsay Piper, have been arrested on charges that initially included murder, child abuse, poisoning and torture.</p><p>Joining Nancy Grace Today:</p><ul>\n<li>Darryl Cohen - Former Assistant District Attorney, Fulton County, Georgia, Defense Attorney, Cohen, Cooper, Estep, & Allen, LLC, www.ccealaw.com</li>\n<li>Dr. Shari Schwartz - Forensic Psychologist (specializing in Capital Mitigation and Victim Advocacy), www.panthermitigation.com, Twitter: https://twitter.com/TrialDoc, Author: \"Criminal Behavior\" and \"Where Law and Psychology Intersect: Issues in Legal Psychology\"</li>\n<li>Justin Boardman - Former Special Victim's Unit Detective, West Valley City (Utah), Author: \"I Was Wrong: An Investigator's Battle-cry for Change Within the Special Victims Unit\", JustinBoardman.com, Twitter: @boardman_train</li>\n<li>Dr. Michelle DuPre - Forensic Pathologist and former Medical Examiner, Author: \"Homicide Investigation Field Guide? & \"Investigating Child Abuse Field Guide\", Former Police Detective Lexington County Sheriff's Department</li>\n<li>Dave Minsky - Public Safety and Military Reporter, Santa Maria Times, Lompoc Record and Santa Ynez Valley News, Twitter: @daveminsky</li>\n</ul><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
