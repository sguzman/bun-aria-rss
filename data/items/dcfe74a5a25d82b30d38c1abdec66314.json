  "description": "<p><a href=\"https://footlooseforays.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Michael Ellis</a> has been around. His goal in life has been to excite and educate people about the rhythms of the natural world and biological processes, thereby stimulating an active participation in the protection of the valuable resources of the planet. By acting as a communication bridge between academicians and interested but untrained individuals he hopes to make the world of science less threatening but still wondrous.
