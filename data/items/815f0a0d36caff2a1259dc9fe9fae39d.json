  "description": "Rhett Lewis and Bucky are back with a new episode. First, the guys talk about the Chiefs' Monday Night Football win against the Chargers and specifically discuss when the Chargers should look for their next QB, while giving a few names of college quarterbacks who could fit on the team from this upcoming draft class (:31). Next, the pair react to Alabama QB Tua Tagovailoa's injury and analyze if he should stay in college for another season or enter the draft, as the injury could hurt his draft stock (11:05). Then, the duo talk about a player who also had a bad injury and was projected to be a very high pick (21:49). After, Rhett and Bucky look at which college quarterbacks will rise in the draft if Tua potentially slides (24:37). The guys also highlight Oklahoma QB Jalen Hurts' impressive comeback win over Baylor and project how high he could be drafted (28:43). To wrap up the episode, Seattle Seahawks' offensive coordinator Brian Schottenheimer joins the podcast to discuss what makes Seahawks' QB Russell Wilson special and his philosophy on offense (32:40).<p>Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
