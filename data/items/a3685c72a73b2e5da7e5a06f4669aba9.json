  "description": "<p>Happy May, boozers and shakers! Get ready to white knuckle and buckle because it's the last month before Gemini season starts and we're already trying to figure out how to send gift-giving drones to each other. These last few months might have looked an awful lot like our own homes but that doesn't mean we can't spike our dopamine levels with some spooky stories! We've got a \"date from Nopesville\", a Scientology encounter and some haunted elevators and dorm rooms. And be sure to stay til the very end for a bonus story that just might involve a haunting and our favorite citrus... and that's why we drink!<br />Please consider supporting the companies that support us! <br />Visit Audible.com/DRINK or text drink to 500-500</p>\n",
