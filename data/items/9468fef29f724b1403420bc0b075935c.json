  "description": "<p>Sourdough starters! Ancient yeasts! Why we need/knead dough! And why you don't need to buy a starter to start. Polymath, particle physicist, inventor of the Xbox, and truly delightful fermentation nerd Seamus Blackley joins to chat about his kitchen adventures resurrecting dormant yeasts from 4,000 Egyptian baking vessels, plus wild yeasts, the infuriating myth of “yeast scarcity,” the beauty of everyday objects, the debt we owe our ancestors, the joy of getting to know your dough plus tons of tips for newbie and experienced bakers. The first half is all about the history of baking and yeasts and some hot Egyptian gossip, then we roll up our sleeves in the second half for how-tos. Forward this episode to anyone who bakes, who wants to bake, who lovingly feeds their jar of yeasts, who is intimidated by it or who just needs a lesson on how to slow down and enjoy the dormancy period we’re in right now. This episode’s got it all. Including some truly shameless bread puns. </p>\n<p>Follow Seamus <a href=\"http://twitter.com/SeamusBlackley\">@SeamusBlackley</a> and here’s one recipe tutorial megathread: https://twitter.com/SeamusBlackley/status/1135328857660305408 </p>\n<p>Follow: Egyptologist <a href=\"https://twitter.com/drserenalove\">Dr. Serena Love</a>, microbiologist Richard Bowman <a href=\"https://twitter.com/rbowman1234\">@RBowman1234</a> </p>\n<p>and the coiner of “Gastroegyptology,” <a href=\"https://twitter.com/KieranDonnachie\">Kieran Donnachie</a> </p>\n<p>A donation went to Boys and Girls Clubs of America: <a href=\"https://www.bgca.org\">https://www.bgca.org</a></p>\n<p>Sponsor links: <a href=\"http://sakara.com/ologies\">Sakara.com/ologies</a>; <a href=\"http://kiwico.com/ologies\">Kiwico.com/ologies</a></p>\n<p>More links at <a href=\"http://alieward.com/ologies/gastroegyptology\">alieward.com/ologies/gastroegyptology</a></p>\n<p>Transcripts & bleeped episodes at: <a href=\"https://www.alieward.com/ologies-extras\">alieward.com/ologies-extras</a></p>\n<p>Become a patron of Ologies for as little as a buck a month: <a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/ologies\">www.Patreon.com/ologies</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ologiesmerch.com/\">OlogiesMerch.com</a> has hats, shirts, pins, totes and STIIIICKERS!</p>\n<p>Follow <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ologies?lang=en\">twitter.com/ologies</a> or instagram.com/ologies</p>\n<p>Follow <a href=\"http://twitter.com/AlieWard\">twitter.com/AlieWard</a> or <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/alieward/?hl=en\">instagram.com/AlieWard</a></p>\n<p>Sound editing by <a href=\"http://jarrettsleeper.com/\">Jarrett Sleeper</a> of MindJam Media & <a href=\"http://www.stevenraymorris.com/\">Steven Ray Morris</a></p>\n<p>Theme song by Nick Thorburn</p><p><a href=\"http://Patreon.com/ologies\">Support the show: http://Patreon.com/ologies</a></p>\n",
