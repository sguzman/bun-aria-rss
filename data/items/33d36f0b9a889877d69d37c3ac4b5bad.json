  "description": "<p>Since the beginning of humanity, I’m sure there’s been a fascination with the accumulation of a lot of “stuff”. There were probably a bunch of cave-people who had way too many animal skins and rocks hanging around just for the sake of showing off to the cave-folks in their neighborhood (this is basically the premise of every episode of The Flintstones by the way).</p> <p>It’s probably a hard-wired psychological game that if you have the most stuff, you win. But the sad reality is that this accumulation gene is still alive and well within us today. As a result, there’s been a tidal wave of folks jumping to the complete other of the spectrum to become minimalist (in revolt of our typical hoarding nature). But, as with most things, there’s actually a much more balanced middle ground that you can find happiness. But, it starts with you finding out just how much the clutter in your life matters.</p> <p>Seriously, this information blew me away! I had no idea how much organization in our lives could affect our food choices, our motivation in life, and our overall success. Today’s guest helps break this stuff down in a way that makes sense, and I promise that you’re going to experience ah-ha moments left and right!</p> <p>Our guest in this powerhouse episode is New York Times bestselling author Chalene Johnson. She’s an icon in the fitness industry (she literally revolutionized at-home fitness with her record-breaking workout DVDs), a dedicated wife and mother, and an absolute in the world of business, personal development, and entrepreneurship. If anyone had permission to clutter-up their life, it was her. But she found that the clutter was controlling her and holding her back. Now she’s on a mission to show you just how much the clutter is affecting you, and how to efficiently and effectively de-clutter your life.</p> <h2>In this episode you'll discover:</h2> <ul> <li>The truth about vitamin C (it doesn’t work like you think it does!).</li> <li>Why spending time NOT working is a big part of our health.</li> <li>How dieting can get associated to being unhappy.</li> <li>Why it’s critical to decide what’s most important to you.</li> <li>Why you shouldn’t start a new diet until you get your environment de-cluttered.</li> <li>How clutter is a psychological obstacle in our lives.</li> <li>The shocking way that clutter can affect your food choices.</li> <li>How tidiness in your home impacts your levels of motivation.</li> <li>Why everything you’re exposed to requires you to make a decision (this is huge!).</li> <li>Why hiding your clutter (aka getting clutter out of your sight) is actually a great temporary solution.</li> <li>The belief we have about time that causes us to create clutter.</li> <li>Powerful tips to effectively de-clutter your life.</li> <li>Why everything needs a home.</li> <li>The secret of do it NOW.</li> <li>How simply paying attention to how you feel can help you to de-clutter your life.</li> <li>Why you should never leave a room empty-handed.</li> <li>Why it’s actually ok to be messy (you just need a good pre- and post-game routine).</li> <li>The interesting connection between tidiness and success.</li> <li>How clutter is linked to a scarcity mindset.</li> <li>How to deal with sentimental objects that are cluttering your space (this is important!).</li> <li>Why de-cluttering makes room in your life for new and better things.</li> <li>Why guilt might be the reason that you hang on to things.</li> <li>How to use The Four Bin Method to transform your home.</li> <li>A great gift you can give your kids by simply tidying up one thing in their room each day.</li> <li>How to recruit your family to keep your home safe, clean, and organized.</li> </ul> <h2>Items mentioned in this episode include:</h2> <ul> <li><a href=\"https://themodelhealthshow.com/organifi\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Organifi.com</a> ⇐ Use the coupon code model for 20% off</li> <li><a href=\"https://themodelhealthshow.com/onnit\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Onnit.com/Model</a> <== Get your optimal health & performance supplements at 10% off!</li> <li>The Chalene Show <a href= \"https://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-chalene-show-diet-fitness-life-balance/id911042029?mt=2&ign-mpt=uo=4\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Apple Podcasts</a> / <a href= \"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/chalene-johnson-2/turbo-charged-life-with-chalene-johnson\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Stitcher</a> / <a href= \"http://www.chalenejohnson.com/podcast/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Website</a></li> <li><a href= \"http://www.chalenejohnson.com/podcasts/the-declutter-project-part-1/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Declutter Episode One</a></li> <li><a href= \"https://www.amazon.com/Life-Changing-Magic-Tidying-Decluttering-Organizing/dp/1607747308\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Life-Changing Magic of Tidying Up</a></li> <li><a href= \"https://www.hsn.com/shop/huggable-hangers-closet-organizers/ho0300-2868\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Huggable Hangers</a></li> <li><a href=\"http://131method.com/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">131method.com</a></li> </ul> <p>* <a href= \"https://s3.us-east-2.amazonaws.com/themodelhealthshow/Episode+287.pdf\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Download The Transcript</a></p> <p>Thank you so much for checking out this episode of The Model Health Show.
