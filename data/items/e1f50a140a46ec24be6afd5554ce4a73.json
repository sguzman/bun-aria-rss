  "description": "In his new book, The Man in the Middle: An Inside Account of Faith and Politics in the George W. Bush Era (B&H Books, 2011), Timothy S. Goeglein, former deputy director of the White House Office of Public Liaison under President George W. Bush, describes his nearly eight years working for the White House. He describes President Bush’s reaction to the 2000 election recount, his response to the tragedy of September 11, and the behind-the-scene deliberations leading up to Bush’s stem cell policy. (Goeglein also, ahem, puts in a plug for the host of this podcast, saying on page 114 that he “relied heavily on my colleague in Public Liaison, Tevi Troy, whose outreach to the American Jewish community was singularly well done.”)\n\nIn our interview, we talked about Tim’s experiences serving in the White House, why Gary Bauer endorsed John McCain in 2000, and how Tim got Karl Rove to write the foreword to his book. Read all about it, and more, in Goeglein’s story-filled new book.\n\nPlease become a fan of “New Books in Public Policy” on Facebook, if you haven’t already.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
