    "media:description": "A major earthquake has hit TC39, the JavaScript standards committee. A proposal for adding type annotations to JavaScript has just landed on the committee and has been approved for Stage 1. What is this proposal all about? How did it come to be? What is the motivation behind it? What are its pros and cons? Why are some people excited about it, some wary, some angry, and some afraid? \nAs one of the writers of this proposal, I will delve into the details of the proposal, and try to answer all the questions above.\n\nPUBLICATION PERMISSIONS:\nNearForm Organizers provided Coding Tech with the permission to republish NearForm tech talks.\n\nCREDITS:\nNearForm YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/c/nearForm",
