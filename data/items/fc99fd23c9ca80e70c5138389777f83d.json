  "description": "Joe Pantoliano is widely known for playing bad guys, lowlifes and disreputable characters. He even has his own pseudo-Mafioso nickname: Joey Pants. But Joe tells Marc the reason he got so good at playing bad guys is because he was always bullied when he was younger. Tapping into that helped him with his acting, but he had to wait until later in life to tap into the cause of his depression, which was tied up in his complicated parentage and inescapable genetics. They also talk about some of his best known roles from The Sopranos, The Fugitive, Midnight Run and more. This episode is sponsored by Tournament of Laughs on TBS, <a href=\"http://hbomax.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">HBO Max</a>, and <a href=\"http://benjerry.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Ben & Jerry's</a>. <p>Sign up here for WTF+ to get the full show archives and weekly bonus material!  <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast\">https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast</a>.</p>\n\n<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
