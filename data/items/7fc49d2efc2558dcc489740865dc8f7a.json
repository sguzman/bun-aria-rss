  "description": "<p>Talking about money with your partner can be extremely hard! We’ve all heard funny stories and countless anecdotes of money fights within relationships, but the fact remains that these disagreements often end in broken relationships. This week we have an honest and revealing conversation with our wives about how we talk about and handle our finances as couples. We also had some great questions that were posted in our Facebook group- some specific ones we get to are:</p><p>Any advice for newlyweds in handling finances together? (from Chelsea)What was our biggest financial disagreement? (from Katy)Do we agree on the goal of financial Independence? (from Connor)(plus a bunch of other embarrassing and funny stories!)</p><p>And since we recorded while at the beach down in Jacksonville, it was fitting that we stumbled upon a fantastic new local brewery! At the beginning of this episode we each cracked open and enjoyed a Bulletproof Denali by Southern Swells Brewing Co. which you can learn all about on Untappd.
