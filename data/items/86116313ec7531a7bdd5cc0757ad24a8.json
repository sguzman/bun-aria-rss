  "description": "On Wednesday’s Mark Levin Show, whether it’s COVID, Afghanistan, or the economy, President Biden’s speeches have become predictable – he points the finger, says he will fix it with government programs, and then leaves without taking questions. We've had situations in the past but we’ve never had supply chain issues. The problem with the Biden administration is that there are no pro-growth policies and no economic expansion policies. Biden’s aim is to massively spend your taxpayer money and fundamentally alter the economy. Democrats are set on their own American Marxist model, so they attack capitalism and use class warfare to turn one person against another. Later, the Loudoun County school board put out a statement claiming they didn’t know that Scott Smith’s daughter was raped in a school bathroom. If there was a violent attack in school, it would have definitely been brought to the attention of the board. The Loudoun county superintendent and school board should resign. Also, Janet Yellen doesn’t know why you are concerned with the IRS peeking into your bank account. They want every transaction of $600 to be monitored. They’re not going to catch tax cheats with a $600 transaction. This is their way to get a foot in the door so they can spy on you. Finally, Bret Baier calls in to discuss his new book, To Rescue the Republic: Ulysses S. Grant, the Fragile Union, and the Crisis of 1876.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
