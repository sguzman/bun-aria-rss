  "description": "On Mondays Mark Levin Show, so-called constitutionalistson the Right are pouncing on the president for suggesting the use of the National Emergencies Act. Unconstitutional, illegal and improper are not to be conflated with a difference of opinion. Commentators who suggest otherwise don't understand constitutional conservatism and have never criticized previous presidents who have used the same law. So why the misunderstanding? Congress can still \"check\" the president by reversing such action with a simple majority. This is not autocratic, unlike DACA which had no statutory basis in law, the president is fully within his rights to do so. In fact, any such action would pale in comparison to President Trump's predecessors' usage of the same Act. Many of these so-called \"conservative\" commentators are \"never-Trumpers\" that are doing America a disservice by omitting history and context from their analysis. Then, the New York Times spent the weekend joining the demagoguery and Russian propaganda theorizing on whether President Trump was a Russian spy, knowingly or unknowingly. Yet the only evidence that we've seen shows that the Obama Administration, DOJ, FBI abused the FISA Court to spy on Trump. They tried to go after Trump's team using the Logan Act as a pretext to start a criminal operation. They used political opposition research for these misdeeds, and they're still not done. The Democrats and the media have been in bed together in this unrelenting attack to reverse the outcome of the 2016 election by advancing their narrative of Trump-Russian collusion. Later, Sen. Diane Feinstein should be investigated for \"political espionage\" per a Federalist article in August of 2018.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
