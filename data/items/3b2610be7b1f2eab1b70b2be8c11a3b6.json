The lawsuit is ongoing, and just this January, new allegations in the states’ complaint were freshly unsealed: the states have <a href=\"https://www.wsj.com/articles/google-misled-publishers-and-advertisers-unredacted-lawsuit-alleges-11642176036\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">accused</a> Google of tinkering with its ad auctions to mislead publishers and advertisers and expand its own power in the marketplace.

This week on Arbiters of Truth, our series on the online information ecosystem, Evelyn Douek and Quinta Jurecic spoke with Tim Hwang, Substack’s general counsel and the author of the book “<a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/Subprime-Attention-Crisis-Advertising-Originals/dp/0374538654\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Subprime Attention Crisis: Advertising and the Time Bomb at the Heart of the Internet</a>.” Tim argues that online advertising, which underpins the structure of the internet as we know it today, is a house of cards—that advertisers aren’t nearly as good as they claim at monetizing our attention, even as they keep marketing it anyway. So how worried should we be about this structure collapsing? If ads can’t convince us to buy things, what does that mean about our understanding of the internet?
