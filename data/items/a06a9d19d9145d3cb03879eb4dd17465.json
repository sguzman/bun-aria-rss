  "description": "<p>On today’s show, Pat and the guys record pieces of the episode on the plane on their way back from Waco, Texas. The show is highlighted by three incredible interviews from this past week. First, Minnesota Head Football Coach PJ Fleck joins the program to talk about his undefeated Golden Gophers team, his relationship with holder Casey O’Brien and how his story has inspired him and the rest of the team. Coach Fleck also addresses the people who think his coaching style is phony or fake, all while giving one of the most incredible inspirational speeches you will ever hear and will have you eager to run through a brick wall. He also clears up the rumors that Minnesota didn’t agree to play a night game in next week’s tilt against Penn State, and talks about what it means to be ELITE in the Minnesota Gophers program (3:22-19:19). Next, 2x Super Bowl Champion and former Pittsburgh Steelers legend, Ike Taylor joins the show. Ike and Pat chat about everything currently going on in the NFL, who Ike likes moving forward as we get closer to the playoffs, why he doesn’t think Tom Brady is going anywhere this offseason, the mentality it takes to be a great football player, and why that sometimes doesn’t mesh with other people’s expectations, and what he makes of the Baker Mayfield/beat writer drama and whether or not he or his teammates had any situations like that while he was in Pittsburgh (22:29-33:34). Lastly, 2x Super Bowl Champion, and current linebacker for the New England Patriots, Kyle Van Noy joins the show for an incredible interview. He and Pat discuss what it’s like playing for the Patriots, how many people will never understand Bill Belichick’s sense of humor, the controversy surrounding Sam Darnold saying he was seeing ghosts against the Patriots, what makes their defense so special, and what Bill Belichick’s message is when they huddle together on the sidelines during games (35:23-51:45). It’s a fun one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
