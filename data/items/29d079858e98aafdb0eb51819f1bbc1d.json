  "description": "<p>On today's show, the guys finally get their hands on a couple bottles of Teremana tequila and do a tasting event to give their honest opinions, on arguably the hardest booze to get your hands on, on the face of the earth. They also chat about some of their favorite Christmas movies that they've been watching, and go through a bunch of listener questions that find their way into a LOADED Pod FOD for this week. Plus, all the boys send in their most played song of the year for a special year-end edition of Friday Bangerz. Today is a fun one. Don't forget to send your questions to @ThePodPMI on Twitter and Instagram, and be sure to subscribe to youtube.com/thepatmcafeeshow to watch full episodes of the show after you become a member of the McAfee Mafia. Be safe this weekend, we'll see you on Wednesday.</p>\n",
