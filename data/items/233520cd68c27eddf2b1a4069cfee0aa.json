  "description": "<p>Even prior to our current situation, there has been an explosion of interest in local food production.  While we’ve always produced food for our own use, it wasn’t until this year that we chose to start producing for our community.  For our family, grassfed beef was an obvious place to start.  On today’s episode, I begin from the ground up with everything about grassfed beef.  Learn why every calf is typically grass fed but not always grass finished.  Discover the health benefits of grassfed beef, why the government can effect the taste of your food, and why your gut will appreciate grassfed animals.  If you're unsure of what exactly constitutes something as grassfed and what the true benefits are, this episode is sure to open your eyes.</p><p><br/>>> A BIG shout-out to our podcast sponsor this month— Lehman’s Hardware! <a href='https://bit.ly/PH-lehmans'>https://bit.ly/PH-lehmans</a></p><p>They are your one-stop homesteading shop for EVERYTHING you need for an old-fashioned lifestyle.
