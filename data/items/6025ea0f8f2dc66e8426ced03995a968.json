  "description": "In today's podcast, we hear that Turla's back, with a depressingly nifty man-in-the-middle campaign. The US thinks it sees Russia trying to influence Mexico's national elections. Russian banks are hit with a new mobile Trojan. Iran continues its Internet crackdown, and conducts more domestic surveillance and hacking. Winter Olympics-themed cyberattacks rely on well-crafted social engineering. Patch Tuesday addressed Spectre, Meltdown, Flash, and an Office zero-day. Yossi Oren from BGU on vulnerabilities in mobile device replacement touchscreens. Stay away from flashlight apps. (And take a look at your dog-walker's app, too, while you're at it.)",
