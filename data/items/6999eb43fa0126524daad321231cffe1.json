Investigators say two masked suspects can be seen on security cameras outside the rural home. Minutes later the electricity is cut, and the door to the home forced open.

Investigators say Titus had previously made threats to kill the family. What is surprising is Titus' accomplice, his attorney, Keegan Harroz, now caught up in a twisted love triangle.</p><p><br></p><p>Joining Nancy Grace Today:</p><ul>\n<li>Dale Carson - High Profile Attorney (Jacksonville), Former FBI Agent, Former Police Officer, Author: \"Arrest-Proof Yourself, DaleCarsonLaw.com</li>\n<li>Dr. Jorey Krawczyn - Psychologist, Faculty Saint Leo University; Consultant Blue Wall Institute, Author: Operation S.O.S. </li>\n<li>Joe Scott Morgan - Professor of Forensics: Jacksonville State University, Author, \"Blood Beneath My Feet\", Host: \"Body Bags with Joseph Scott Morgan\"</li>\n<li>Levi Page - Crime Online Investigative Reporter, Host, \"Crime and Scandal\" True Crime Podcast, YouTube.com/LeviPageTV </li>\n</ul><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
