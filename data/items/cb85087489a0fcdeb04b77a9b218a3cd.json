  "description": "<p>British Actor Malcolm McDowell trained at the London Academy of Music and Dramatic Art. While he’s had many notable stage roles, audiences likely know him best for a single, iconic character, Alex DeLarge, the anti-heroic criminal turned victim in Stanley Kubrick’s 1971, <em>A Clockwork Orange</em>. McDowell tells Alec how he developed Alex DeLarge’s signature look with the cricket codpiece, bowler hat, and single disorienting lower eyelash. McDowell also talks about his life-long friendship with mentor Lindsay Anderson, who directed McDowell in his debut film, <em>if,</em> in 1968. In his mid-70s, McDowell is still going strong, acting in film and television and enjoying roles such as a talent agent in HBO’s <em>Entourage</em> and a retired orchestra conductor in Amazon’s <em>Mozart in the Jungle</em>.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
