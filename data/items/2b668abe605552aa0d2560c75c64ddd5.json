  "description": "<p>Stories connected to the McDowell Medical College cover all the bases for a good ghost tale. There was the unusual construction of the building, medical experiments, grave robbing, mental illness, Spiritualism, a Civil War prison and lots of death. The only thing missing in this story is the actual building. The former Ralston-Purina Company owns the land today, but tales of supernatural happenings persist. Join us as we share the history and hauntings of the McDowell Medical College! The Moment in Oddity was suggested by John Michaels and features the Talking Stove of Spain and This Month in History was suggested by Chelsea Flowers and features Frank Hayes dying of a heart attack during the Belmont Stakes.</p> <p>Check out the website: http://historygoesbump.com<br /> <br /> Show notes can be found here: http://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2020/06/hgb-ep-342-mad-doctor-mcdowell-and-his.html</p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</p> <p>The following music is from https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/:</p> <p>\"Vanishing\" by Kevin MacLeod (Moment in Oddity)<br /> \"In Your Arms\" by Kevin MacLeod (This Month in History)</p> <p>License: CC BY (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)</p> <p>All other music licensing: PODCASTMUSIC.COM License Synchronization, Mechanical, Master Use and Performance Direct License for a Single Podcast Series under current monthly subscription.</p> <p>Gothic Palace by ALIBI Music</p>",
