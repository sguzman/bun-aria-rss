  "description": "<p>Brandi Love, former friend of the Kirk Minihane Show, has snapped on social media, attacking the Minifans, smearing Kirk, and even invoking her Second Amendment rights in tweets about Kirk; Kirk responds. George Ford, the Scorsese of Fire, joins the show to talk about the business and artistic aspects of filming pleasant fire place scenes for Netflix (0:28:30). Stephen Colbert's alleged comedy show has somehow gotten so unfunny that even elderly columnists for the Boston Globe are rightfully ridiculing him. Gary Tanguay is the new holiday fill-in hots for WEEI. Intern Justin finally cracks a smile on the wrap-up show... and it's some creepy shit. Jared Carrabis joins the show for a little update, and someone is jealous of Ryan Whitney. One more day in SC left.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
