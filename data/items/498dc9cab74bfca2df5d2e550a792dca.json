  "title": "Episode 255: True Crime Songs with Ronnie & Ben from Watch What Crappens!",
  "description": "This episode we are joined by Ronnie Karam and Ben Mandelker of the Watch What Crappens podcast, for something a bit different! Throughout the years recording Morbid we’ve come across an abundance of songs that were inspired by true crime events. We figured it would be pretty interesting to break down some of the crimes and songs with these fellas. We revisit the Moors murders to talk about The Smith’s ballad “Suffer Little Children,” reminisce on hearing Fastball’s “The Way” while having no idea that it was inspired by something dark and last but not least we dive into Neko Case’s “Deep Red Bells,” which was inspired by the Green River Killer’s victims. <br>\n<br>\nAs always, thank you to our sponsors:<br>\n<br>\nHelloFresh: Get up to fourteen free meals—including free shipping! —when you use code morbid14 at <a href=\"http://HelloFresh.com/morbid14\" target=\"_blank\">HelloFresh.com/morbid14</a><br>\n<br>\nPurple: Right now, you’ll get 10% off any order of $200 or more!
