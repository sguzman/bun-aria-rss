  "description": "<p>THERE IS JUST CONSCIOUSNESS AND ITS CONTENTS. When you’re dreaming, you don’t know that you’re asleep. You’re caught up in the dream. That’s how most of us go through life. We’re unaware that we’re not actually experiencing the things we are feeling. But you can break the spell in a moment with meditation. When you become present, you’re no longer asleep. It’s time to wake up. On today’s episode of The School of Greatness, I continue my conversation on meditation and mindfulness with one of the greatest thinkers of our time: Sam Harris. Sam Harris is a New York Times best-selling author, podcast host, and creator of the Waking Up Course. His books include The End of Faith, Letter to a Christian Nation, The Moral Landscape, Free Will, Lying, Waking Up, and Islam and the Future of Tolerance (with Maajid Nawaz). The End of Faith won the 2005 PEN Award for Nonfiction. His writing and public lectures cover a wide range of topics—neuroscience, moral philosophy, religion, meditation practice, human violence, rationality—but generally focus on how a growing understanding of ourselves and the world is changing our sense of how we should live. Sam shares that when he experiences emotions like anger to sadness, he becomes interested in the emotion. He observes his body’s reaction and tries to distance himself from the feelings. So get ready to learn how mindfulness can end suffering on Episode 824.<br />\nSome Questions I Ask:<br />\nHow do you eliminate worry?
