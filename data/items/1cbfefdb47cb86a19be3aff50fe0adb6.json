I have mine.\n\nOver the last year in particular, I've received a lot of pushback on my comments re: Michel Thomas. People seem religiously devoted to this method. It may just be because I'm wrong and the method's amazing but I think there's another reason:\n\nLearning a lot *about* a language can leave you feeling as if you've *learned* the language.\n\nThere's a big difference.\n\nWhat are your thoughts?",
