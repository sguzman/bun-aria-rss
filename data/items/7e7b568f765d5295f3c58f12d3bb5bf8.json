  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, WJNO Host Brian Mudd fills in for Mark.  Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu has banned Congresswomen Ilhan Omar and Rashida Tlaib from entering Israel for their support of the boycott Israel movement known as BDS. This effort is very real but what makes this more astounding is that there are sitting Members of the U.S Congress who are actually advocating for this. Then, the ineptitude of the Philadelphia District Attorney led to six cops getting shot when a gunman, with an illegally obtained gun, fired hundreds of rounds at the officers.   What's worse is that the suspect had multiple prior gun charges that downgraded and dismissed by a liberal District Attorney that chose not to prosecute him more aggressively.  Later, the Dayton shooter's autopsy revealed that he was on cocaine and other drugs when he was killed by police after his mass shooting. Looking at the tragedies in El Paso, Dayton and even in Parkland shed light on what the will of the people is regarding gun control. Laws like the Red Flag laws will not stop the mentally ill or murderous from causing the harm they intend to cause.  \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
