  "description": "<p>This week, your Literary Life podcast hosts, Angelina Stanford, Cindy Rollins and Thomas Banks are happy to be joined by Kelly Cumbee to talk about Edmund Spenser. They begin the conversation with Kelly giving a little biographical information on Spenser. Kelly shares how she came to read <em>The Faerie Queene</em> with her own children and for her education, then fell in love with it herself. Angelina talks about Spenser's style of writing and his vision for creating a medieval feel in his work. Kelly gives us a brief synopsis of the general outline of <em>The Faerie Queene</em> and the virtues that are the focus of each book. Some other topics they discuss are the courtly love tradition, the harmony between the court and the country, the journey of the soul pictured in the quest stories, and the levels of reading that may be applied to <em>The Faerie Queene.</em></p> <p>Cindy is hosting a new summer discipleship course for moms this year, so head over to <a href= \"https://morningtimeformoms.com/product/morning-time-for-moms-summer-discipleship-2021/\"> morningtimeformoms.com</a> for more info and to sign up!
