  "description": "<p>Too many people complain that their friends and family aren't supporting their business. Here's the reality: you're going to need way more than the support of your friends and family to be successful. Plus, your friends and family aren't obligated to support you. When it comes to the real world of business, they owe you nothing. It's your job to provide a quality product or service that everyone would want to support. And it's your job to sell them on that quality product or service. But above all, you have to think of support in terms of a bank account. Don't constantly ask other people to make withdraws on your behalf. You want to be the guy who make more deposits in other people's accounts.</p>",
