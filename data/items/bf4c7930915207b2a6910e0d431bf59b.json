[1:16:15]</p><p>Michael once joked that he would love How to Be Perfect to do for moral philosophy what A Brief History of Time did for astrophysics. If that’s a tall order, what would he consider an acceptable takeaway for its readers? [1:27:58]</p><p>What qualifies the legitimacy of a philosopher? Is it when they can get people to actually read (and understand) their work? [1:32:58]</p><p>If Michael could have a drink or dinner with any philosopher, living or dead, who would he choose? [1:39:53]</p><p>What two philosophers would Michael choose to have on speed dial for his own personal instruction? [1:43:36]</p><p>What comics in my own collection do I most treasure? What kind of D&D characters did I tend to play in my youth? [1:49:11]</p><p>Michael’s most worthwhile failures (and one recurring failure that still gives him nightmares).

[2:06:00]</p><p>Why Michael encourages us all to get educated about ethics by any means comfortable (and if that includes reading How to Be Perfect, so be it) where the proceeds of book sales will be directed, and other parting thoughts.
