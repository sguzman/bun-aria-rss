  "description": "\"I have people that are not Latino arguing with me about what we’re like,\" Justina Machado says about two-thirds of the way through her chat with Todd. The actress, who joins ITYI to talk about the latest season of her Netflix sitcom One Day at a Time, has been giving superlative performances for two decades now, with a career that encompasses everything from the live episode of ER to an Arsenio Hall sitcom to the classic HBO drama Six Feet Under.\n\n\n\n\nBut it's One Day at a Time that has given Machado a part that lets her show off all she's capable of. In any given episode, she might play the highs of being a hugely accomplished working mom, or the crippling lows of depression and PTSD. She gets to deliver wisecracks that bring instant laughter and long monologues that will wring tears. She gets to do anything and everything and a little bit of what's in between.\n\n\n\n\nThat's why Todd wanted to have her on, but their conversation very quickly ranged from talking about One Day at a Time to talking about women of color finding work in Hollywood, while trying to avoid taking roles that are simple stereotypes, as well as what Machado has learned from getting to work with Rita Moreno (a pioneer when it comes to Latina actresses) on One Day at a Time. And lest you think that sounds too heavy, know that every answer Machado gives is punctuated by her amazing laugh — one of the best in show business.\n      \n      \n      \nLearn more about your ad choices.
