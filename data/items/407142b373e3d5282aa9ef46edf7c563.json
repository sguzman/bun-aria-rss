  "description": "Lindsay Peoples Wagner got her first taste of the fashion industry interning at <em>Teen Vouge</em>, where she cleaned massive closets filled with the season's latest trends. She eventually went on to serve as the publication's editor-in-chief for nearly three years. During this pandemic, she left her job at <em>Teen Vouge</em> and took on two new roles: the editor-in-chief of <em>The Cut</em>, a digital publication, and the co-founder of the Black in Fashion Council. Lindsay shares how the Black in Fashion Council is addressing inequalities within the fashion industry, and offers advice for young journalists trying to break into publishing. These conversations are excerpts from our <em>How I Built Resilience</em> series, where Guy talks online with founders and entrepreneurs about how they're navigating turbulent times.<p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
