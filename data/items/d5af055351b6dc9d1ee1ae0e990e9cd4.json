  "description": "President Trump is knocking down the media’s house of fear. The media went nuts when Trump took off his mask on the White House balcony and told Americans not to let the coronavirus dominate their lives. But Glenn shows that Trump is not the first leader to echo the words of FDR: “We have nothing to fear but fear itself.” New York Gov. Andrew Cuomo is threatening to close synagogues that don’t comply with his COVID-19 restrictions. All eyes may soon be on the Temple Mount thanks to the Israel/UAE deal. Washington Examiner reporter Salena Zito discusses if Joe Biden really is dominating in the polls. Secret Trump voters do exist, and people are switching to Trump from 2016. Movie theaters are closing yet again.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
