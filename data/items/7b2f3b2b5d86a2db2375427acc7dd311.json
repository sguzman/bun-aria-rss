  "description": "<p><p>ROUND 1: Now that the UFO/Area 51 drama has subsided, we need to alert you to a much more pressing matter…. Torpedo Eating Sea Monsters. Yarghhh with eyes black… like a doll's eyes...</p><p>ROUND 2: We've got an unreal story of bravery, selflessness & resilience from a soldier who stepped up to save lives during horrible training accident. </p><p>ROUND 3: Holy micromanagement, Batman. This is a hot story about a coolin' problem as our forces in Europe are given new guidance on air conditioning units. </p><p>ROUND 4: An Airman smashed a world record by bench pressing 551 got-damn pounds at a powerlifting competition and we're not that impressed because we're all pretty fit here at ZBT and could, like probably do that too. </p><p>ROUND 5: The Marine Corps is getting SOFT as BABY SHIT because they want Marines to carry umbrellas. UMBRELLAS!</p><p>Round 6: A vigilante Marine tried to take down a cartel all by his lonesome. He didn't succeed but he did get taken into custody by NCIS! </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
