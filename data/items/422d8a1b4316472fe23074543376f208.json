  "description": "<p>Steve is a very old friend of Joe’s and was one of the headliners in Boston when Joe started out in his stand up career. These conversations for me are some of the best podcast as they give you a very unique insight into the world of stand up comedy. There is also a really good connection these two have knowing each other for so long. Make sure to check  it out.  </p>\n <p>Enjoy my review folks!</p>\n <p>Please email me with any suggestions and questions for future Reviews:</p>\n <p>Joeroganexperiencereview@gmail.com</p>\n",
