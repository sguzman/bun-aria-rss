  "description": "In this episode, I discuss the biological mechanisms of the state changes that occur during different types of meditation and describe how to develop the meditation practice optimal for you. I explain key meditation principles, such as using specific breathwork patterns and adjusting your perception to specific locations along the continuum between interoception, exteroception and dissociation. I discuss how meditation practices lead to long-term trait changes and neuroplasticity, including changing your default mood, reducing baseline anxiety/depression, increasing your ability to focus, enhancing relaxation, improving sleep, and increasing your overall happiness level. I also explain the concept behind the “third-eye center,” what mindfulness is from a biological standpoint, the power of ultra-brief meditations and how to select the best meditation and time and duration to meditate to meet your need. I also explain a novel open-eyed perception-based meditation that may enhance focus, relaxation and task-switching ability. Whether you are a novice or an experienced meditator or simply interested in how our brain controls different aspects of conscious awareness and self-regulation, this episode should interest you.\nThank you to our sponsors\nAG1 (Athletic Greens): https://athleticgreens.com/huberman\nInsideTracker: https://www.insidetracker.com/huberman\nThesis: https://takethesis.com/huberman\nROKA: https://www.roka.com/huberman\nSupplements from Momentous\nhttps://www.livemomentous.com/huberman\nHuberman Lab Premium\nhttps://hubermanlab.com/premium\nFor the full show notes, visit hubermanlab.com\nTimestamps\n(00:00:00) Meditation\n(00:04:13) InsideTracker, Thesis, ROKA, Momentous Supplements\n(00:08:25) Brief History of Meditation: Consciousness, Psychedelics, fMRI\n(00:16:19) How the Brain Interprets the Body & Surrounding Environment; Mindfulness\n(00:26:07) Neuroscience of Meditation; Perceptual Spotlights\n(00:32:27) AG1 (Athletic Greens)\n(00:33:41) Interoception vs. Exteroception\n(00:42:20) Default Mode Network, Continuum of Interoception & Exteroception\n(00:53:30) Tools: Interoceptive or Exteroceptive Bias, Meditation Challenge\n(01:01:48) State & Trait Changes, Interoceptive & Exteroceptive Meditations, Refocusing\n(01:07:35) Tool: Brief Meditations, Waking Up App\n(01:10:30) “Third Eye Center” & Wandering Thoughts\n(01:20:46) Meditation: Practice Types, Focal Points & Consistency\n(01:24:10) Breathwork: Cyclic Hyperventilation, Box Breathing & Interoception\n(01:30:41) Tool: Meditation Breathwork, Cyclic vs. Complex Breathwork\n(01:39:22) Interoception vs. Dissociation, Trauma\n(01:47:43) Model of Interoception & Dissociation Continuum\n(01:53:39) Meditation & Dissociation: Mood, Bias & Corresponding Challenge\n(02:00:18) Meditation & Sleep: Yoga Nidra, Non-Sleep Deep Rest (NSDR)\n(02:11:33) Choosing a Meditative Practice; Hypnosis\n(02:14:53) Tool: Space-Time Bridging (STB)\n(02:25:00) Zero-Cost Support, YouTube Feedback, Spotify & Apple Reviews, Sponsors, Social Media\nTitle Card Photo Credit: Mike Blabac\nDisclaimer",
