  "description": "<p>We start the year with a show full of information. First we welcome Jim Price from CLE/Asylum to the show as we look back on his 2019. How many miles did he put on his car? Did he hit his numbers? Then we look into the future and see what 2020 has in store for Christian Eiroa and Tom Lazuka. We will do this while smoking the first cigar from the Care Package for the new year, Asylum Medulla Oblongata Maduro.</p>\n<p>In the second hour we will discuss Dave’s trip to Miami where he was a guest at the Perdomo National Sales Meeting. What information did he find out? We will have the inside scoop that only The Cigar Authority can bring you.</p>\n<p>Additionally, David Garofalo pulls back the curtain. What was the top selling cigar? What cigar sold the most in dollars and what cigar sold the most units along with what price point has the top selling cigars?</p>\n<p>We will have this all the usual suspects including Versus, Offer of the Day, Cigar News and a peek into the Asylum. The Cigar Authority is a member of the United Podcast Network and is recorded live in front of a studio audience at Studio 21 Podcast Cafe upstairs at Two Guys Smoke Shop in Salem, NH and as always you can find many of the cigars we discuss at <a href='https://www.2guyscigars.com/'>http://www.2GuysCigars.com/</a>.</p>\n<p>Never miss an episode by subscribing to the show via <a href='http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-cigar-authority/id413869893?mt=2&ign-mpt=uo%3D4'>Apple Podcasts</a> and <a href='http://thecigarauthority.podbean.com/'>Podbean</a>.</p>\n",
