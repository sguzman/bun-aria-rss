    "media:description": "In this video we look at the entire evolution of Lois Griffin from Family Guy. Voiced by Alex Borstein, we look at Lois' entire life story, her past and future. Taking a look at the Family Guy cutaways, as well as the Family Guy full episodes, I've put Lois's life in chronological order. From season 1 to newest Family Guy season. I go into Lois and Peter Griffins marriage and their children, Meg, Chris and Stewie Griffin.\n\nWe also look at the funniest and best of Family Guy moments from Peter, Lois, Chris, Meg and Brian. As well as other Family Guy characters from Quahog Rhode Island like Quagmire and Joe.\n\n#familyguy  #timeline  #Meg #FunnyFamilyguy\n\n\nCopyright Disclaimer Under Section 107 of the Copyright Act 1976, allowance is made for \"fair use\" for purposes such as criticism, comment, news reporting, teaching, scholarship, and research.
