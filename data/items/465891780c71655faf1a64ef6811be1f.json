  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, Dominion Voting System was recently profiled by PBS as part of their reporting on making elections more secure. However, Democrats filed multiple lawsuits prior to the election to weaken the safeguards protecting elections in all of the battleground states. Alex Halderman, a white-hat hacker checking for vulnerabilities, found that glitches in the programs caused candidate names to disappear. There were several systemic issues with the Dominion Voting System that affected the election and they were known at least three weeks prior to the election. Yet, federal judge Amy Totenberg allowed the State of Georgia to use this system anyway even after the vulnerabilities were known and a last-minute patch was issued to repair it. Then, Federal litigator Sidney Powell calls in to discuss an affidavit from a witness that has come forward to testify of their involvement in using this software to change vote counts in Venezuela and at least one other country. Powell re-iterated that there is plenty of opposition from all sides to end this litigation. Sen.'s Elizabeth Warren (D-MA) and Sen. Ron Wyden (D-KS) have issued letters in the past requesting information on the security of this software. Powell believes that Dominion Voting System has negatively affected several million votes in favor of Joe Biden. The people attacking the recount are undermining our constitutional system. Those trying to eliminate Trump's due process are showing their fascistic colors. Later, Paramilitary Democrats like BLM and ANTIFA must be brought to justice and investigated to the fullest extent. Afterward, Dinesh D’Souza calls in to discuss his new movie - Trump Card The Movie.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
