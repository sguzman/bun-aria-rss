Well, welcome to episode 220 in which we do our best to understand multiverses, black holes and spaghettification (which we promise is a real term) all because Em researched the wrong topic. But as space lovers we were enthralled with the Back Door Theory, because honestly the idea of being torn apart atom by atom is just as scary as any cryptid. Em promises to bring you the Back <em>Rooms</em> Theory (also not the Back Woods Theory) next week. Then Christine pays homage to early pandemic binge watching trends with the story of Joe Exotic, his escalating rivalry with fellow big cat lover Carole Baskin and a murder-for-hire ploy that's only the tip of this chaotic iceberg.
