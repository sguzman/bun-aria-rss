  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, the difference between socialism and capitalism is government coercion. It’s the iron fist of tyranny versus the invisible hand of the free market. The idea of living in a utopia run by the state is a rule for one to abandon their own liberty. Hence why an individual's contribution is downplayed and their race, gender, or other grouping is used to overshadow their individuality this emboldening and empowering the central government – just think of Venezuela. At times this may appeal to someone that feels disenfranchised or is disengaged. This is why the left's radical quest for egalitarianism is focused on erasing one's individual identity and advocates for groupthink and group identity. Liberty, however, is none of those things, it is free and allows us to truly be free as individuals. Then, the Russians and Cubans are supporting Nicolas Maduro in Venezuela, while Sec. Mike Pompeo has announced President Trump's intention to levy sanctions against Cuba if they interfere with the will of the people in Venezuela. Later, we must not forget who was the Vice President of the United States while the Obama Administration was spying on the Trump Administration. Finally, The Democrats are gearing up for the testimony of Attorney General Barr. Meanwhile, the media been nearly silent on the leaks that poured out of the Special Counsel Mueller's Office during his investigation, the focus remains on attacking Barr to discredit him.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
