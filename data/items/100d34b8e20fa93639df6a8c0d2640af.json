  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, how many more lies does President Biden have to tell until he’s impeached? Biden said no military advisor told him to leave troops in Afghanistan but his Generals are telling a different story. These Generals will go down in history as disasters for leaving American citizens behind Taliban lines. If Biden lied about this he will lie about the border, the spending, and everything else. These Generals, particularly Mark Milley, should be forcibly retired for leaking to Bob Woodward. This program expects that Rep. Liz Cheney and Sen. Ben Sasse would demand Biden's impeachment, instead of still chasing down Trump. The conversation of impeaching Biden must be had with the American people because Congress has a constitutional obligation to do so. Later, in \"The Return of the Primitive: The Anti-Industrial Revolution\" Ayn Rand exposed that the left's immediate goal was to destroy capitalism and to establish a global dictatorship. Americans are not as stupid as the Democrats think and Biden's lies on this spending bill is a war on your lifestyle, liberty, and private property. They use climate change as a ruse to control water and any other part of the environment to ultimately control the economy and the people. Why do we have to raise the debt ceiling if the Democrat's $5.5 trillion bill costs nothing? Afterward, Senator Marsha Blackburn joins the show to discuss her questioning in the Senate hearing on Afghanistan today. Blackburn grilled Milley on the exit from Afghanistan and his knowledge of Woodward's book and he responded he hadn't read it.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
