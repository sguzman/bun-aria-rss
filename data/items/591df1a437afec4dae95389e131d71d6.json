  "description": "On Friday's Mark Levin Show, As we broadcast tonight Brett Kavanaugh is an innocent man. His accuser had the opportunity to present her proof in front of the Senate and the nation.

We must remain concerned about our republic. Later, Israeli Prime Minister Benjamin Netanyahu calls in to discuss recent intelligence revealing that Iran has maintained a secret atomic warehouse.
