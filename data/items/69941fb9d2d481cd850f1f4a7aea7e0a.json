  "description": "The divide between the progressive wing of the Democratic Party and centrists has dogged the party for years and hurt Hillary Clinton's campaign in 2016. Thanks to equal parts good planning, good will and the urgency of the threat America faces, that divide has been minimized this year with Biden working closely with progressive leaders like Bernie Sanders, Elizabeth Warren and AOC. The question is: What will happen to progressive concerns should Biden become president? And how does the progressive agenda on defense, climate and other issues fit with the views of Americans of both parties. We discuss with former co-chair of the Bernie Sanders campaign, Representative Ro Khanna of California, Ed Luce of the Financial Times and Kori Schake of the American Enterprise Institute. Join us for this wide ranging, thought provoking discussion.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
