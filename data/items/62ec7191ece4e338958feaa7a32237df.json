You've tried to find resources to help you cope with this, but most of what's you've found feels gimmicky with little to no real information or exercises aimed at helping you overcome these feelings. In this Feedback Friday, we'll try to lend a helping hand.</p>\n<p>And in case you didn't already know it, <strong>Jordan Harbinger</strong> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JordanHarbinger\" target=\"_blank\">@JordanHarbinger</a>) and <strong>Jason DeFillippo</strong> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/jpdef\" target=\"_blank\">@jpdef</a>) banter and take your comments and questions for Feedback Friday right here every week!
