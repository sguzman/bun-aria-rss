  "itunes:summary": "Billy Bray, born in 1794, was a miner from Cornwall. He was an alcoholic. He was always getting involved with fights and arguments at home. At the age of twenty-nine he encountered Jesus. He went home and told his wife, ‘You will never see me drunk again, by the help of the Lord.’ She never did.\nHis words, his tone of voice and his looks all had magnetic power. It was as if he was charged with divine electricity. Crowds of miners would come and hear him preach. Many were converted and there were some remarkable healings. He loved the Bible and said, ‘The promises of God are just as good as ready money any day.’\nGod is the God of promise. Faith involves trusting the promises of God. God makes a promise; faith believes it, hope anticipates it, patience quietly waits for it.",
