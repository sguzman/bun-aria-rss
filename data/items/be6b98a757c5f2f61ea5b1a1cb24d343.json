  "description": "One of the things I always say is, \"I don't agree with you, but I respect your perspective\". When did we get to a place where that idea seems so radical? Yes, there are some things you should never accept, but for so many moments in life, there's a good chance that you and the person standing next to you might not see eye to eye.
