  "description": "<p>Gratitude: what’s the deal? Does it really make us happier? Even when the world seems terrible? Or is being appreciative a bunch of hokey flim-flam? Author Neil Pasricha started a blog of 1000 Awesome Things in 2008 and it led him down rabbit holes looking into the science of gratitude and how to better survive some really tough times. Learn about your new morning ritual, how much of happiness is genetically determined, why you should sniff a tree, honeymoon drama, simple appreciation, singing while making dinner, the gambles you take while scrolling, and how your brain means well -- but can make you miserable on purpose. Also, buy one more cactus. </p>\n<p>Follow Neil Pasricha at <a href=\"http://twitter.com/NeilPasricha\">Twitter.com/NeilPasricha</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/neilpasricha/\">Instagram.com/NeilPasricha</a></p>\n<p>Neil’s website: <a href=\"https://www.neil.blog/\">Neil.blog</a></p>\n<p>3 Books Podcast: <a href=\"https://www.3books.co/\">https://www.3books.co/</a></p>\n<p>A donation went to <a href=\"https://performancespacenewyork.org/\">https://performancespacenewyork.org/</a></p>\n<p>Sponsors of Ologies:<a href=\"http://alieward.com/ologies-sponsors\"> alieward.com/ologies-sponsors</a></p>\n<p>More links and info at<a href=\"http://alieward.com/ologies/awesomeology\"> alieward.com/ologies/awesomeology</a></p>\n<p>Transcripts & bleeped episodes at:<a href=\"https://www.alieward.com/ologies-extras\"> alieward.com/ologies-extras</a></p>\n<p>Become a patron of Ologies for as little as a buck a month:<a href=\"http://www.patreon.com/ologies\"> www.Patreon.com/ologies</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://ologiesmerch.com/\">OlogiesMerch.com</a> has hats, shirts, pins, totes and now… MASKS.
