  "description": "<p>“Because for every kid who makes it out, there are thousands more who are just as capable, who don't. And I think we need to shift the conversation away from what was it that helped that one kid make it out to why are all these other kids not?” Andrea Elliott’s <em>Invisible Child</em> belongs on the shelf next to <em>Evicted</em> by Matthew Desmond and Alex Kotlowitz’s books <em>There are No Children Here</em> and <em>An</em> <em>American Summer</em>. She joins us on the show to talk about eleven-year-old Dasani and her family, how systems feed the poverty cycle, why we need to challenge our love of success stories, and more. Featured book: <em>Invisible Child: Poverty, Survival and Hope in an American City.</em> Produced/hosted by Miwa Messer and engineered by Harry Liang.</p> <p>Follow us here for new episodes Tuesdays and Thursdays.</p>",
