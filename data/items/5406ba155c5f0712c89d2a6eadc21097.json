  "description": "<p>In 2015, Jonas Wood was in London for his show at Gagosian Gallery. He came to The River Cafe for lunch, leaving behind the gift of a beautiful drawing on River Cafe stationery—a spiky long cactus, its leaves reaching out over the logo.</p>\n<p>Jonas brought LA to London, and a cactus to The River Cafe. Ruthie and Jonas promised to meet one day to talk about food, family and art. Six years later, London came to LA to record a podcast.</p>\n<p>Listen here to their time together via the link in our bio.</p>\n<p>For more than 30 years The River Cafe in London, has been the home-from-home of artists, architects, designers, actors, collectors, writers, activists, and politicians. Michael Caine, Glenn Close, JJ Abrams, Steve McQueen, Victoria and David Beckham, and Lily Allen, are just some of the people who love to call The River Cafe home.</p>\n<p>On Ruthie’s Table 4, Rogers sits down with her customers—who have become friends—to talk about food memories. Table 4 explores how food impacts every aspect of our lives. “Foods is politics, food is cultural, food is how you express love, food is about your heritage, it defines who you and who you want to be,” says Rogers.</p>\n<p>Each week, Rogers invites her guest to reminisce about family suppers and first dates, what they cook, how they eat when performing, the restaurants they choose, and what food they seek when they need comfort. And to punctuate each episode of Table 4, guests such as Ralph Fiennes, Emily Blunt and Alfonso Cuarón, read their favourite recipe from one of the best-selling River Cafe cookbooks. </p>\n<p>Table 4 itself, is situated near The River Cafe’s open kitchen, close to the bright pink wood-fired oven and next to the glossy yellow pass, where Ruthie oversees the restaurant.
