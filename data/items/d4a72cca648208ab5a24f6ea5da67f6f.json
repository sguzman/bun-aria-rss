  "description": "<p>Gettysburg is a town in Pennsylvania that is well known for its haunts. The place is steeped in history from the bloody Battle of Gettysburg to one of the most well known Presidential speeches of all time, the Gettysburg Address given by President Abraham Lincoln. So it only makes sense that spirits would be alive and well here. One location that is overshadowed by the Gettysburg Battlefield, but which seems to be just as haunted, is Gettysburg College. The college was founded before the Civil War in 1832. Fighting forces would cross the campus and several buildings would become field hospitals during the Battle of Gettysburg. Listener and Executive Producer Kaydi Bigelow suggested this location and she shares with us her experience of growing up in Gettysburg and attending Gettysburg College, along with the stories of the many spirits that still seem to be hanging around the campus in the afterlife. The Moment in Oddity features the Brazilian Treehopper and This Month in History features the collapse of the Silver Bridge.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here: <a href= \"https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2017/12/hgb-ep-237-gettysburg-college.html\"> https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2017/12/hgb-ep-237-gettysburg-college.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer and join the HGB Losers Club: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p>Music:</p> <p>Vanishing from http://purple-planet.com (Moment in Oddity)<br /> In Your Arms by Kevin MacLeod http://incompetech.com (This Month in History)</p> <p>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br /> http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p> <p> </p> <p> </p>",
