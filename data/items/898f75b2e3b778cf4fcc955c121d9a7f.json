  "description": "<p class=\"\" data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">Even when it seems like you've done everything right as a mom, inevitably, things still don't go as planned. Someone disobeys, comes down with a fever, talks back or leaves their toy on the ground for you to step on, and in no time...you blow it. Your hopes for a near-perfect day are dashed, leaving you wondering if there's even any point in trying. On today's episode, Emily and Laura talk about those bad moments and how we’re tempted to let them dominate our whole day. But we don't have to get stuck there, because our identity in Christ means we can keep pursuing holiness, even when we sin or our circumstances aren’t ideal. When we have faith that the Spirit of Christ works in us and we want to live in light of our redemption, we can press on in faithfulness. Momma, will you join us?</p> <p class=\"\" data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">We’re grateful to World Vision for making this week’s show possible.
