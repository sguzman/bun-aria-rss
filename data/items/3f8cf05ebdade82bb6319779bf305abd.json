  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys chat about the few things going on in the sports world, including The Open Championship, the Richard Sherman situation, the franchise tag deadline in the NFL, and game 4 of the NBA Finals. Joining the program fresh off an incredible performance against Suga Sean O'Malley and potentially possessing the strongest chin on the face of the earth, Kris Moutinho joins the show to chat about the last few weeks, his fighting style, how he took so many punches from Suga Sean, if he thinks Herb Dean should've stopped the fight, what's next, if he signed a UFC contract, and much more (21:24-38:50). Later, joining Pat and AJ Hawk is Ian Rapoport to chat about everything going on around the NFL including the deadline for the franchise tag and which guys Rap Sheet thinks will be signed, if he's hearing anything more about Aaron Rodgers, and what key points we should be looking at over the course of the next few weeks (1:02:21-1:15:02).
