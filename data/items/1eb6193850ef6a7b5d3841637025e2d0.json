  "description": "<p>In a quiet neighborhood, just a few blocks away from Villisca's downtown, stands a very ordinary looking white frame house. The crime that took place here was anything, but ordinary. Six children and two adults would go to sleep on the evening of June 9th in 1912 and never wake up. A neighbor and family member would find the six members of the J.B. Moore family dead, along with Lena and Ina Stillinger. The crime scene was horrific and bloody since all the victims were killed with an axe. The murders were never solved and justice never came. We featured the house back when the podcast first launched in October of 2014 on episode 7. I never imagined that I would eventually visit and tour the house, much less spend an evening sleeping inside. Join myself, Kelly and three listeners on this investigation of the Villisca Axe Murder House. The Moment in Oddity was suggested by Nicole Capps Dixon and features the Boojum of North Carolina and This Month in History features the Veil of Our Lady appearing.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here: <a href= \"https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2019/10/hgb-ep-310-investigation-of-villisca.html\"> https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2019/10/hgb-ep-310-investigation-of-villisca.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p>The following music is from <a href= \"https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/\">https://incompetech.filmmusic.io/</a>:</p> <p>\"Vanishing\" by Kevin MacLeod (Moment in Oddity)<br /> \"In Your Arms\" by Kevin MacLeod (This Month in History)<br /> License: CC BY (http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/4.0/)</p> <p><br /> All other music licensing: PODCASTMUSIC.COM License Synchronization, Mechanical, Master Use and Performance Direct License for a Single Podcast Series under current monthly subscription.</p> <p>March of the Tiny Ghosts by Elias Music Library</p>",
