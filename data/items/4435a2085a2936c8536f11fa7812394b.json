On this episode of The Science of Happiness, the host of Sleep With Me podcast Drew Ackerman joins us to try science-backed tips for finding your natural sleep rhythm. Drew, also known as “Dearest Scooter,” talks about his history with insomnia and sleep anxiety, sleep hygiene, and his philosophy on bringing more self-compassion into his approach to trying to fall asleep. Then we hear from sleep scientist Eti Ben Simon about how sleep affects your social life.</p>\n\n<p><strong>Practice:</strong></p>\n\n<p>Here are four tips to help you sleep from Dr. Eti Ben Simon.</p>\n\n<ol>\n<li><p>Avoid alcohol and caffeine after 2 p.m. to unmask your true biological sleep needs.</p></li>\n<li><p>Keep lights dim in the evening and limit access to LED lights after 9 p.m.</p></li>\n<li><p>Go to sleep as soon as you feel tired (even if you're in the middle of something). This will help you figure out the earliest window it is physiologically possible for you to fall asleep.</p></li>\n<li><p>Do not use an alarm clock to wake up.</p></li>\n</ol>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Try a version of this practice with the sleep tips in this article by expert Eti Ben Simon:</strong></p>\n\n<p><a href=\"https://tinyurl.com/2nesff8t\" rel=\"nofollow\" target=\"_blank\">https://tinyurl.com/2nesff8t</a></p>\n\n<hr>\n\n<p><strong>Today’s guests:</strong></p>\n\n<p><em>Drew Ackerman</em> You might know Drew as his alias, “Dearest Scooter*,”* the host of Sleep with Me podcast.
