  "description": "Our guest this week is founder and chairman of Brazil Resources, Amir Adnani. As we enter the early stages of a likely precious-metal bull market, few are more prepared than Amir. His company, Brazil Resources, has grown over 400% just this past year. On today's episode, Amir gives us some reassuring factors for this upcoming quarter and explains why investors have yet to miss the boat. Amir shares with us how Brazil Resources has something that 99% of other developmental-gold companies don't have. He then breaks down Brazil Resources recent 'under-the-radar' acquisition which expects to bring a massive 40% asset-base increase. After this, you'll see why Brazil Resources is in a very unique place. We then touch up on two of the most important factors a successful junior mining company can have. In addition, Amir breaks down a possible added benefit for shareholders covering a \"hidden\" sector at its 10-year-low. Amir then ends the episode telling us his goals for Brazil Resources and how their disciplined, committed approach can pay off investors in a long-term perspective.",
