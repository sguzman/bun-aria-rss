  "description": "<p>In America, real estate investment has been the primary way for people to build wealth that they can sustain and pass down to their children. But the vast majority of those who get a piece of the real estate pie are white men. Real estate investment has a long history of systemic inequity due in part to racist lending practices and exclusionary urban planning Despite the challenges, there are BIPOC entrepreneurs working to change the exclusivity of this industry. On this episode, we hear from two individuals working to make real estate investing more accessible. First, we hear from real estate consultant Lisa Phillips about how she turned her initial failure in real estate investing into a successful consulting business helping other Black professionals navigate an industry that kept them out. Then host Carla Harris sits down with Ryan Williams, Founder and Executive Chairman of Cadre. Ryan discusses what inspired him to create the fintech platform and how it aims to democratize real estate investment.</p><p><br></p><p><a href=\"https://www.morganstanley.com/what-we-do/inclusive-innovation-and-opportunity\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://www.morganstanley.com/what-we-do/inclusive-innovation-and-opportunity</a></p><p>&nbsp;</p><p><em>Disclaimer text</em></p><p><em>The guest speakers are neither employees nor affiliated with Morgan Stanley & Co.
