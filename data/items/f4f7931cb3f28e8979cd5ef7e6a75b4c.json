    "media:description": "In this video we elaborate on the central importance of the 12 tone chromatic scale -- transcending the usual preoccupation in western music with \"major\" and \"minor\" scales -- and also the natural naming system for tones that we introduced last time.  \n\nWe want to connect with the natural and familiar geometry of the clock and associated mod 12 arithmetic, and tabulate the various common intervals and our new names for them.\n\nWhile this is all somewhat elementary, this does have the potential for a serious re-evaluation of not just standard music theory but also the relationship between mathematics and music. In particular we see possibilities to engage many students with mathematicss through their prior interest in music.\n\nWe also look briefly at the history of mathematicians contributing to the theory of music. Quite a few famous mathematicians, including Descartes, d'Alembert, Euler and others engaged with the theoretical aspects of arithmetic. So there is a lot of precedence for this attempt to rethink some of the basic structure of music.  \n\nThe basics of \"mod 12 arithmetic\" are also reviewed for an audience without necessarily a mathematics background. So some of my regular viewers will find some of the discussion here rather simple and obvious. However we are setting the stage here for some really major new insights into mathematical notation as well which we will meet more extensively in future lectures.\n  \nFinally: a big thank you to all my Patreon supporters -- your help is so much appreciated!\n\n***********************\nHere are all the Insights into Mathematics Playlists:\n\nElementary Mathematics (K-6) Explained: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?\nlist=PL8403C2F0C89B1333\nYear 9 Maths:   https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85CcGpZpO542YLPeDIf1jqXK\nAncient Mathematics: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85Aqe2b4FBWUGJdYROT6-o4e\nWild West Banking: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85DB7CzoFWvA920NES3g8tJH\nSociology and Pure Mathematics: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85A-qCypcmZqRvaS1pGXpTua\nOld Babylonian Mathematics (with Daniel Mansfield): https://www.youtube.com/playlist?\nlist=PLIljB45xT85CdeBmQZ2QiCEnPQn5KQ6ov\nMath History: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL55C7C83781CF4316\nWild Trig: Intro to Rational Trigonometry: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL3C58498718451C47\nMathFoundations: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL5A714C94D40392AB\nWild Linear Algebra: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85BhzJ-oWNug1YtUjfWp1qAp\nFamous Math Problems: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85Bfc-S4WHvTIM7E-ir3nAOf\nProbability and Statistics: An Introduction: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85AMigTyprOuf__daeklnLse\nBoole's Logic and Circuit Analysis: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85CnIGIWb7tH1F_S2PyOC8rb\nUniversal Hyperbolic Geometry: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85CN9oJ4gYkuSQQhAtpIucuI\nDifferential Geometry: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLIljB45xT85DWUiFYYGqJVtfnkUFWkKtP\nAlgebraic Topology: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PL6763F57A61FE6FE8\nMath Seminars: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLBF39AFBBC3FB30AF\n************************\n\nAnd here are some of the other Wild Egg Maths Playlists (some available only to Members!)\n\nSolving Polynomial Equations: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdiPTrEWyz7hk_Kzj4zDF_kUXBCtiGn6\nExceptional Structures in Maths and Physics via Dynamics on Graphs\" https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdiPTrEWyz5HBT_Yo1G4DfeqUfI9zkKM\nTriangle Centres: https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=iLBGXDSUohM&list=PLzdiPTrEWyz6VcJQ5xcuqY6g4DWjvpmjM\nSix: An elementary course in pure mathematics: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdiPTrEWyz4KD007Ge10dfrDVc4YwlYS\nAlgebraic Calculus One: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdiPTrEWyz4rKFN541wFKvKPSg5Ea6XB\nAlgebraic Calculus Two: https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLzdiPTrEWyz5VLVr-0LPPgm4T1mtU_DG-",
