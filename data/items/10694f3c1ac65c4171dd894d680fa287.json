  "description": "It’s easy to trust God when things are going our way, but what about when things aren’t going our way? Are you frustrated or unhappy because something is not working out like you think it should? That’s conditional trust.Let Joel teach you how to have unconditional trust in what God is doing in your life. Psalm 138:8 promises us that  “God will work out His plan for your life.” You don’t have to work it out. You don’t have to make it all happen in your own strength and fight all of your battles. God knows what’s best for you. Instead of living life frustrated, you can live contented and restful, trusting in God’s timing.<p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
