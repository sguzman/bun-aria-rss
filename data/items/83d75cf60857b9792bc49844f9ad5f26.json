    "media:description": "In this bar race we'll take a look at gaming imports per 1000 people, which lets you compare the interest in gaming between countries. These imports includes console and computer games, arcade machines and all sorts of gaming consoles.\n\n\nNote that some of the major gaming countries, such as China and Japan don't appear on this list since they mostly buy local games and consoles. \n\n\nI attribute the dip in imports around 2008 to the proliferation of the modern smartphone which seems to have had a huge impact on console and video game sales throughout the world.",
