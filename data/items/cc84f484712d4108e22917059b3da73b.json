  "description": "With Passover upon us, we sit down with Rabbi Nahum Ward-Lev who is also an author and Spiritual Guide to discuss the Passover and its impact on our spirituality.  Rabbi Nahum sheds light on three Jewish holidays in light of liberation and wilderness.  Together, we explore what it means to be a liberated people, and what to do when we find ourselves in the wilderness.  Rabbi Nahum brings an interesting perspective in light of the plague of the Corona Virus and the global wilderness we find ourselves in.  \n\nMike, Bonnie and Tim do an Outro to the episode and discuss how an understanding of the Jewish background of the text and Jewish spirituality impacts the Christian faith.  Together, we wade through an understanding of wilderness and how the point of the wild is to learn how to be free.  \n\nTo find out more about Rabbi Nahum please visit his website: https://rabbinahum.com\n\nIf you’d like to order his book, The Liberating Path of the Hebrew Prophets Then and Now, visit: https://www.amazon.com/Liberating-Path-Hebrew-Prophets-Then/dp/1626983291/ref=sr_1_1?keywords=nahum+ward+lev&qid=1580387652&sr=8-1\n\nLearn more about the VOX Podcast:\nwww.voxpodcast.com\n\nSubscribe on iTunes - apple.co/1Lla1Nj\nSupport the VOX Podcast on Patreon:\n\nwww.patreon.com/voxpodcast\n\nFollow us on Instagram: @voxpodcast\nLike us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/voxpodcast\nFollow Mike on Twitter: www.twitter.com/mikeerre\n\nMusic in this episode by Timothy John Stafford\nwww.timothyjohnstafford.com\nInstagram & Twitter: @GoneTimothy\n",
