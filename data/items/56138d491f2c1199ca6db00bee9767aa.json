  "description": "<p>Your life is always speaking to you in whispers, guiding you to your next right step. And in many situations, the whisper is also the first warning. It’s a quiet nudge from deep within saying, <em>Hmmm, something feels off. </em>A small voice that tells you, <em>This is no longer your place of belonging. </em>It’s the pit in your stomach, or the pause before you speak. It’s the shiver, the goosebumps that raise the hairs on the back of your neck. Whatever form the whisper takes, it’s not a coincidence. Your life is trying to tell you something. Heeding these signs can open the doors to your personal evolution, pushing you toward your life’s purpose. Ignoring them or sleepwalking through your life, is an invitation to chaos. In this Super Soul podcast, Oprah sits down with such gifted writers and thought leaders as Shauna Niequist, Dani Shapiro, Caroline Myss, Adyashanti, Jon Kabat Zinn, Cheryl Strayed, Pema Chödrön, Amy Purdy, John Lewis, Wes Moore, Kerry Washington and Thomas Moore. Interviews with these talented writers, speakers and thought leaders are excerpted from Oprah’s Emmy Award-winning show Super Soul Sunday. You can also find this compilation and other insightful conversations, in Oprah’s best-selling book, The Path Made Clear.</p>\n<p> </p>\n",
