  "description": "<p>Dave Smith came over to my apartment to catch me up on the state of America over the last year or so. We've gone through a lot of change as a country. Gay marriage was legalized, racial tension with the police came to a head, government spending reached new heights and much more. Dave broke down all the important American stories and we analyzed them together. Ahir Shah, Alex Kealy, and Alex Smith are my roommates for the Edinburgh Fringe Festival and they weighed in on the intro as outside observers of what's going on in the good old US of A.</p>",
