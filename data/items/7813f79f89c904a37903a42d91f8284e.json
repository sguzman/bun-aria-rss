  "description": "Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged. This week I’m joined by John Petrides – Managing Director and Portfolio Manager at Point View Wealth Management. On today’s episode, John and I look back at the major headlines from 2016. So much has happened… and as a result, we’ve witnessed one of the most volatile years in stock market history. John provides listeners with a step-by-step market review – leading us all the way to today’s rally. Oil prices hit 10-year lows… gold had its best 1st quarter in 30 years… “macro” events like Brexit, and the Election – all have had their place in this years economic roller-coaster. As investors, there are many lessons we must carry-over into the new year. Tune in to hear why John and I are approaching 2017 much differently than last year. Also, It’s about time… The Fed finally raised interest rates – squeezing in one hike in a year that was supposed to have four. What now? As John says, the biggest question lies behind the “language” of the Fed going forward. He explains why investors need to be cautious if interest rates rise faster than expected. Switching gears, John shares with us the biggest post-election headwind for several S&P 500 companies. A tax reform is on it’s way… but that does not mean these stocks are off the hook. This is why I love bringing John on the show. He can give listeners insight on just about any topic. To end the episode, John gets on a roll – giving his outlook on a wealth of sectors. This includes one sector that has been completely overblown… And another that hasn’t traded this cheap since 2009.",
