  "description": "<p>The ketogenic diet has gained a lot of popularity in the past couple of years. If you’re not quite sure what it is, why it could be beneficial, or you’re well-acquainted with it and just want to learn more, this episode is for you. The ketogenic diet, or keto as it’s called, is a high-fat low carbohydrate diet. While some people take this to mean loads of conventionally raised meat and dairy, the true (and beneficial version) means lots of beneficial fats from things like avocados, nuts and seeds, and coconut; high-quality protein from clean sources like grass-fed meat and pasture-raised eggs; and plenty of non-starchy vegetables.&nbsp;</p><br><p>To hash out more of the details about keto and how it can support good health, I was excited to talk with my friend and one of the leading voices in the Paleo/Primal and keto movements, Mark Sisson. Mark is the founder of the popular daily health blog, Mark’s Daily Apple, godfather to the Primal food and lifestyle movement, and the <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of <em>The Keto Reset Diet</em>. His latest book is <em>Keto for Life</em>, where he discusses how he combines the keto diet with a Primal lifestyle for optimal health and longevity. Mark is the author of numerous other books as well, including <em>The Primal Blueprint</em>.</p><br><p>This episode is sponsored by Joovv, chili, and my Sleep Master Class.</p><br><p>I recently discovered Joovv, a red light therapy device. Red light therapy is a super gentle non-invasive treatment where a device with medical-grade LEDs delivers concentrated light to your skin. It actually helps your cells produce collagen so it improves skin tone and complexion, diminishes signs of aging like wrinkles, and speeds the healing of wounds and scars. Check out the Joovv products at <a href=\"https://joovv.com/farmacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">joovv.com/farmacy</a> and use the code FARMACY at checkout.</p><br><p>One of the easiest and most effective ways to get better sleep every single night is through temperature regulation, which is why I was so relieved to discover the transformative products from Chili. The chiliPAD and OOLER system are two really cool gadgets that fit over the top of your mattress and use water to control the temperature of your bed - which helps lower your internal temperature and trigger deep relaxing sleep. Right now chili is offering my audience a really great deal. Get 25% off the chiliPAD with code hyman25 or 15% off OOLER with code hyman15, just go to <a href=\"https://www.chilitechnology.com/pages/drhyman\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">chilitechnology.com/drhyman</a></p><br><p>In this modern world we place too much value on staying busy and deprioritizing sleep, which is why I have created my first ever Master Class.&nbsp;It guides you through the most important steps to getting better sleep, starting today.
