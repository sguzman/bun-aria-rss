You know the answer. This is an interesting question because this is the kind of future that is inevitable. Smart, wearable technologies is going to eat up the world. Everything in the world will be smart. All of it. ALL of it. Your shirt. Your pants. Your underwear. Your socks. It's all coming over the next ten to twenty to thirty years.</span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">It allows things that are physical to go so much further in the digital world. The layering and ammo that this gives Disney in that upfront investment is extraordinary. The recall, the content pushing out, the unlocking new virtual features - all of a sudden now, they have the ability to change the flow of the park. One of the things that I am most fascinated by right now as a retailer is efficiency. Efficiency everywhere. In an airport, an amusement park, or a retail store. Where do you know there are always going to be congested areas? Then, where are the places people just aren't going? Now imagine slapping some technology on a rock all the way in left field that requires people to go there. Now you're moving people there, making less lines. People are buying more food; even a fourth of a hot dog adds up to a lot. </span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">Those are the things you need to be thinking about.
