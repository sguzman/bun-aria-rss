  "description": "Patient Beth is standing by Ben, and trying to get him to talk. He tells her that the pregnancy will need to be induced.  Beth is upset for Chelsea.  Later she finds Ben slumped on the bed. She tries to talk to him, but he knows how distressed she is, what she’s hiding from him. He hears her crying in the living room at night. And it’s all his fault. Beth will always stick by him, because she’s a good person.  But he’s not.  Beth protests, but Ben starts to pack for her. He’s got to save her from herself. \nRuth reports back to Alice from Shula, who’s been in touch.  She’s very confident about Alice running the Stables while she’s away, and the work she’s doing is hard but rewarding. Ruth is about to take a meal over for Ben and Beth.  As they arrive in the Stables yard, Ben throws Beth out of the house. Ben and Beth are both deeply distressed and Beth is begging him not to do it.  Alice looks after Beth, while Ruth hammers on the door to make Ben let her in.  Ben breaks down completely and tells her everything. Ruth assumes Beth has left because he’s the child’s father, but Ben tells her he’s told Beth to leave.  Beth has been nothing but kind and tried to help him.  Chelsea has to go through hell, he’s put Beth through hell, and he gets off scot-free.  He doesn’t know who he is any more.  Ruth holds him in her arms.",
