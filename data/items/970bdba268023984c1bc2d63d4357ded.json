  "description": "On today's show, Pat and the guys break down everything that happened in week 2 of the NFL including an abysmal performance from The Brand, Josh Gordon being traded to New England, the drama surrounding the Steelers and Antonio Brown, and Todd dives into Urban Meyer's body language. Also joining the show is former running back for Ohio State and the Denver Broncos, Maurice Clarett, for an incredible conversation. They chat about his side of the story in relation to how things went down during his time at Ohio State and where it all went wrong, as well as what he is doing now to try and make a positive change (45:15-1:06:54). Later, former LSU running back and Pat's teammate with the Colts, Joseph Addai, calls into the show. They cover what he's been doing since he retired, how Houston is hotter than Ghana, his favorite memory as a Colt, and his relationship with Reggie Wayne (1:09:22-1:28:50). Don't forget to check out PatMcAfeeShow.com for all the new merch. Cheers.\n",
