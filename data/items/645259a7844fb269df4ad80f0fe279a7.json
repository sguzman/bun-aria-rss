Do you strive only for gallery owners and interior designers? This week, we're flipping this issue on it's head to highlight the positive aspects of a strong artist network. &nbsp;As we discuss this issue, we share our own experiences and the benefits we've gained from building relationships with our peers. These benefits include painting sales, business advice, collaborations, and surprising opportunities - not to mention the fun we've had! We also answer a listener question about framing, share the inspiring story of an American singer-songwriter, and touch on the cycle of expansion and contraction in our work.</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned:</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://youtu.be/s2ygLmzahTg?t=594\">Jason Isbell's Youtube concert</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/agasheshilpa/\">Shilpe Agash on Instagram</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/stories/highlights/17866599406742578/\">Tara Leaver's IG story highlights&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p>Find us and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\">bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</a></p>\n<p>Buy us a coffee at: <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\">https://ko-fi.com/artjuice</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p>Alice <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com@alicesheridanstudio/\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p>Louise <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p><em>Credits</em></p>\n<p><em>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</em></p>\n",
