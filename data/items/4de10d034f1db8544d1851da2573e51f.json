  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, this program goes beyond commentary, we are activists on a mission because America as we know it is under attack. The tide is turning, and people want their country back! This program helped launch this ideological counter-revolution to the American Revolution from parents attending school board meetings in Loudoun County, VA to the release of American Marxism. Everything that the book discussed from the use of Marxism to the usurpation of our liberty is on the line in this election. Democrats are damaging the country and the patriots of America must choose liberty, unite, and stop them at the ballot box. Then, if you want to destroy America, in addition to food shortages and diesel fuel shortages, then Vote Democrat. The republic is being destroyed by people who hate our founding and prosperity and that is what this election is really about. The movement to restore America is afoot and right it's now a matter of life and death for our republic. Later, Florida Governor Ron DeSantis joins the show with an update on his campaign for re-election. DeSantis says he is ready for the people of Florida to cast their votes and make their choice. DeSantis has been proactive in taking steps to counter the corporate press and the radical movement to sexualize children in the classroom, Afterward, Tudor Dixon, candidate for Governor of Michigan, calls in to discuss her race against Gretchen Whitmer. Dixon says that her opponent is beholden to the Teacher's Union and will watch the whole state suffer as a result. Dixon will reduce regulation for businesses and automakers. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
