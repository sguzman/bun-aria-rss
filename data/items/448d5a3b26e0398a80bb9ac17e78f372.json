These sick burns and criticisms come courtesy of the father of Communism himself, Karl Marx. Your hosts, Connor and Dan, break down the intrinsic flaws of capitalism, such as alienation, expendability, and instability, and offer the listener only the most poorly thought out solutions, such as \"what if everyone had money?\" Regardless, it's a good ep. Enjoy!</strong></p>",
