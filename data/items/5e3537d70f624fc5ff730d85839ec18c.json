  "description": "Event coordinator Gemma Davenport is in the business of love…literally. She loves her job, and she&#039;s good at it. Still, Gemma has never had the opportunity to try love out for herself. There&#039;s only one man who&#039;s tempted her enough to consider it, and he&#039;s a jerk. The sexiest jerk she&#039;s ever met. So, why does her body come alive when she walks into a blind date to find…him?\n\nFergus Digby hates incompetence. He is meticulous and runs his company with an iron fist. Fergus is used to getting what he wants. And he wants Gemma Davenport. Since she turned down his advances not once, but twice, he can&#039;t stop thinking about her. Fantasizing about having her in his bed.\n\nWhen Fergus finally gets Gemma alone, the sparks between them grow into fireworks. Can they look past the reasons they shouldn&#039;t be together and embrace the once-in-a-lifetime passion they&#039;ve ignited? Or will their relationship go up in flames before it&#039;s really begun?\n\neBook Blindsided now: https://amzn.to/3sHivw8\nGet her free ebooks here: https://bit.ly/3DaG6tT\nMore Matilda Martel eBooks: https://amzn.to/38622If\n\nSIGN UP FOR RMR NEWSLETTER - https://bit.ly/3Dgwmyy\n\nOther Mentioned Books\nEvil Twin by Kati Wilde\nLuna and the Lie by Mariana Zapata\n\nRMR Website: https://bit.ly/3ifFIyw\nWeekly New Release: https://bit.ly/30iDete\nFollow Read Me Romance on Instagram: https://geni.us/uUVdVeY\nJoin Read Me Romance Headquarters on FB: https://geni.us/IdL7B\nFind Alexa Riley on Instagram: https://bit.ly/2HGrxpQ\n\nRead Me Romance Theme Song by L.B.
