  "description": "Melvyn Bragg and guests discuss the work, ideas and life of the Russian poet whose work was celebrated in C20th both for its quality and for what it represented, written under censorship in the Stalin years. Her best known poem, Requiem, was written after her son was imprisoned partly as a threat to her and, to avoid punishment for creating it, she passed it on to her supporters to be memorised, line by line, rather than written down. She was a problem for the authorities and became significant internationally, as her work came to symbolise resistance to political tyranny and the preservation of pre-Revolutionary liberal values in the Soviet era.\n\nThe image above is based on 'Portrait of Anna Akhmatova' by N.I. Altman, 1914, Moscow\n\nWith\n\nKatharine Hodgson\nProfessor in Russian at the University of Exeter\n\nAlexandra Harrington\nReader in Russian Studies at Durham University\n\nAnd\n\nMichael Basker\nProfessor of Russian Literature and Dean of Arts at the University of Bristol\n\nProducer: Simon Tillotson.",
