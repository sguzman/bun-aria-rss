  "title": "304 - Super Predator Peter Nygard and an interview with Chris Hansen",
  "description": "<p>Rare interview on the Suck today! Chris Hansen from To Catch a Predator, and his new podcast Predators I've Caught with Chris Hansen. I ask him about today's subject, Peter Nygård, the disgraced Canadian fashion mogul who currently sits in a Winnipeg jail cell after roughly five decades of sexual abuse allegations. Nygård has been called the Canadian Jeffrey Epstein for good reason - he used his wealth and privilege to brutally prey on young women and girls he offered career opportunities too, flying many of them to his luxurious, private estate in the Caribbean, and recruiting women and girls to find him more victims. Chris adds additional insight to our research, and also offers extra insight into sexual predators in general. Hail Nimrod! And Hail Mimrod as well!<br /><br /><strong>Bad Magic Productions Monthly Patreon Donation</strong>:  The Bad Magic Charity for July is The National Compassion Fund.
