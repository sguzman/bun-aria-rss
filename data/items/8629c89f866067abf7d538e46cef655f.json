  "description": "Mike Posner has written hits for himself like \"I Took a Pill in Ibiza,\" and for stars from Justin Bieber (\"Boyfriend\") to Maroon 5 (\"Sugar\"), so he has insights for days on what makes a pop song work.\nWe dig into Mike's excellent new track \"Song About You,\" which leads to an exploration of songs that reuse the same melody for verse and chorus—from Prince to The Boss to Post Malone. Last, we consider \"beard phase\": a moment of artistic reinvention that every artist has in their career, whether you're Mike Posner, Ludwig van Beethoven, or Taylor Swift.\nFeaturing:\nMike Posner - Song About You\nJean Ritchie - Barbary Allen\nOriginal Sacred Harp Singers - New Britain (Amazing Grace)\nPrince - I Wanna Be Your Lover\nPrince - Let's Go Crazy\nBruce Springsteen - Born in the U.S.A.\nPost Malone - Rockstar\nBeethoven - String Quartet No 1 Op. 18/1\nBeethoven - String Quartet No 10 Op. 74/III\nBeethoven - String Quartet \"Grosse Fuge\"\nTaylor Swift - Teardrops on My Guitar\nTaylor Swift - We Are Never Ever Getting Back Together\nTaylor Swift - ...Ready For It?\nBeatles - Strawberry Fields Forever\nDennis Wilson - River Song\nPeaches ft.
