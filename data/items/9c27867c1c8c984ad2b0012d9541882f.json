  "description": "<p>Hold onto your bellybuttons, because it’s finally here! This week we had the pleasure of sitting down with the lovely gals of Wine & Crime to discuss “glow up” stories… Don’t worry, Christine had to google it too. Em takes “glowing up” quite seriously with their coverage of the Flying Dutchman and his glowing, skeleton-filled ship. Meanwhile, Christine takes somewhat of a left turn and covers the story of serial killer Jake Bird and his murderous hex that left six people dead. It was a glow up for him, but a glow down for the rest of the world. And that’s why we drink!
