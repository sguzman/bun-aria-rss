  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the outrage mob is coming after me because I mentioned the forbidden historical fact that white people were slaves too. But why is this fact forbidden? And why does it matter? We’ll discuss. Also, the Biden Administration gears up to “forgive” student loans. And by “forgive” we mean “transfer to loans to people who didn’t take them out.” Plus, a Democrat congresswoman flips off her Republican colleague and then cries sexism to excuse herself. In our Daily Cancellation, an artist goes viral with dozens of comics bitterly complaining about her husband. We’ll talk about all of that and much more today on the Matt Walsh Show. \n \nStop giving your money to woke corporations that hate you.
