  "description": "Go behind the scenes of Duck Dynasty, and find out what really went down. What's the truth about Uncle Si's basketball skills? Was Phillip McMillan (aka Phillip McVillain) really Willie's nemesis, and are the Robertsons really that competitive? Martin admits he split his pants on one episode and remembers a close call with a cannon. Phillip recalls Jase sharing Jesus with him. The boys offer a crash course on how to speak Si and reveal the three things they'd take to a deserted island. And Godwin remembers his first full-contact volleyball game with the Robertsons and rates his favorite Duck Dynasty episodes.  \n \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
