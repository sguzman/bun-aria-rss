For the vast majority of us, the simplest approach is often the best. So we’ll cover the importance of simplicity by highlighting the issues with complexity, and we’ll also discuss how to make your personal financial life a winning mix of straightforward yet thoughtful at the same time.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Scorpius Morchella by Toppling Goliath- thanks to Kelsey for donating this one to the show!
