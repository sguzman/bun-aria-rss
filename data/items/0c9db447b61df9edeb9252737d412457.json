    "media:description": "This 30-hour sculpting project by our Co-founder Morten Jaeger has been edited down to just 10 minutes to give you a look into what it takes to create Majora and Skull Kid from The Legend of Zelda Majora's Mask. \n\nWe wanted to take this iconic character from and re-create him in 3D based on the original drawings from the N64 game. Everything is sculpted in ZBrush and rendered using Blender. This could also be sculpted in Blender or any other sculpting software, but we chose ZBrush for this.\n\nGet the full 10-hour course here:\nhttps://flippednormals.com/downloads/stylized-character-sculpting-in-zbrush-majora-skull-kid/\n\nMusic by THEOPHANY - Used with Permission\nhttps://theophany-rmx.bandcamp.com/\n\n▶ SUBSCRIBE | https://www.youtube.com/c/FlippedNormals?sub_confirmation=1\n\n▶ MARKETPLACE | https://flippednormals.com/\n\n▶ FREE Tutorial Chapters | https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCvd6HxqYVWvfvfaF2Ereb9Q\n\n▷ Instagram | https://www.instagram.com/flippednormals/\n▷ Twitter | https://twitter.com/flippednormals\n▷ Facebook | https://www.facebook.com/flippednormals\n▷ Merch | https://teespring.com/stores/flippednormals\n\nOur episodes are also available on all major podcast services!",
