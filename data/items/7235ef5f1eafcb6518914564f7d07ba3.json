  "description": "<p>We have great comedians as guests every week, but this is the first great comedian AND sideline reporter of <em>Cannonball </em>on the USA network we’ve ever had. Welcome Simon Gibson! Hailing from Portland, Oregon, Simon is an LA based comedian who “dazzles, frazzles, sizzles, and sazzles every time he’s onstage! He’s a one person personification of hoolarity!” (<em>Owl Quarterly</em>). We have a great conversation about life, comedy, and being a sideline reporter on a show that is essentially <em>American Ninja Warrior </em>for people with type 2 diabetes. Here are five words to describe this episode: jump or be eaten alive?</p>",
