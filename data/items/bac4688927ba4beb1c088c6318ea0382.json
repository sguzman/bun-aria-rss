  "description": "I’m getting a lot of questions regarding , when I stated I’d gone bearish.  While data shows inflation is coming down—along with the price of oil (the sector with the largest impact on consumers)—the Fed seems hell-bent on more interest rate hikes. I share what I need to see to rejoin the bullish camp… and why I’m struggling to find a growth catalyst for markets.  But it’s not all negative…  There are two sectors you can scale into now… and reap the rewards once the Fed finally realizes its plan is working and eases rates.
