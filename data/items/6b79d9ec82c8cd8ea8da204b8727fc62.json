  "description": "<p>Joe List kept me awake on the drive back from Boston by telling me all about Boston. Meta as balls, huh? He grew up out there and we talked about all the casual violence, the racism, the women, the drinking, the sports. Everything we could think of. And while we were driving, we past by where Joe picked up herpes. So it's like a tour of his diseased shaft at the same time.</p> <p> </p> <p>Joe List is in this season of The Standups on Netflix. Definitely check it out. He's one of the best comedians in New York. Do yourself a favor and watch it. Add it right now to your watch list, and then watch it first chance you get. The Standups Season 2. Enjoy.</p>",
