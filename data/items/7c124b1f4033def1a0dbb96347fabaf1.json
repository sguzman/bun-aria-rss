  "description": "<p>“I'm always coming back to Chicasetta, in the same way that Ernest Gaines always comes back to Bayonne parish. And William Faulkner always comes back to that county that I cannot pronounce, your top or whatever it is, right. You know, in the same way that Louise Erdrich returns to the particular reservation, I'm always coming back to these characters.” Finalist for the National Book Award, poet Honorée Fanonne Jeffers has conjured an epic and indelible story of an American family with <em>The Love Songs of W.E.B. Du Bois</em>; beautifully written, it’s a story we never wanted to end (and you won’t either). Honorée joins us on the show to talk about love and home and family, the legacy of slavery, colorism, feminism, writing about Black joy, Lucille Clifton, and much more with Poured Over’s host, Miwa Messer. And we end this episode with TBR Topoff book recommendations from Marc and his bookseller guest, Becky.</p> <p>Featured Book:</p> <p><em>The Long Songs of W.E.B Du Bois</em> by <a href= \"https://www.barnesandnoble.com/s/%22Honor%C3%A9e%20Fanonne%20Jeffers%22?Ntk=P_key_Contributor_List&Ns=P_Sales_Rank&Ntx=mode+matchall\"> Honorée Fanonne Jeffers</a></p> <p>Poured Over is produced and hosted by Miwa Messer and mixed by Harry Liang.
