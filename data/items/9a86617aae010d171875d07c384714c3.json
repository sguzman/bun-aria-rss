  "description": "<p>Patent retrieval influences several applications within engineering design\nresearch, education, and practice as well as applications that concern\ninnovation, intellectual property, and knowledge management etc. In this\narticle, we propose a method to retrieve patents relevant to an initial set of\npatents, by synthesizing state-of-the-art techniques among natural language\nprocessing and knowledge graph embedding. Our method involves a patent\nembedding that captures text, citation, and inventor information, which\nindividually represent different facets of knowledge communicated through a\npatent document. We obtain text embeddings using Sentence-BERT applied to\ntitles and abstracts. We obtain citation and inventor embeddings through TransE\nthat is trained using the corresponding knowledge graphs. We identify using a\nclassification task that the concatenation of text, citation, and inventor\nembeddings offers a plausible representation of a patent. While the proposed\npatent embedding could be used to associate a pair of patents, we observe using\na recall task that multiple initial patents could be associated with a target\npatent using mean cosine similarity, which could then be utilized to rank all\ntarget patents and retrieve the most relevant ones. We apply the proposed\npatent retrieval method to a set of patents corresponding to a product family\nand an inventor's portfolio.\n</p>",
