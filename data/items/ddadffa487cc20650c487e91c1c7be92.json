  "description": "<p>One year ago this month, the last American troops withdrew from Afghanistan, marking the end of a 20-year war. To reflect on those two decades, <em>Lawfare </em>managing editor Tyler McBrien sat down with Elliot Ackerman, author of the new book, “<a href=\"https://www.penguinrandomhouse.com/books/709027/the-fifth-act-by-elliot-ackerman/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Fifth Act: America's End in Afghanistan</a>.” They discussed Elliot's personal involvement in the struggle to get Afghan allies out of Kabul a year ago, as well as his time in Afghanistan, first as a Marine and then as a CIA officer. Drawing on firsthand experience, Elliot spoke about what it means to win or lose a war and some of the reasons why this war was a debacle for Americans and a tragedy for Afghans.</p><p>Support this show <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"http://supporter.acast.com/lawfare\">http://supporter.acast.com/lawfare</a>.</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
