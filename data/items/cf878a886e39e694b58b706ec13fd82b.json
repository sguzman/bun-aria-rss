This is on top of the security breach that led to her resignation.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Since her reinstatement by Rishi Sunak, Suella Braverman’s reappointment has been embroiled in a row with opposition parties and even some Tory MPs.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>But Downing Street says Mr Sunak has &#8220;full confidence&#8221; in her &#8211; but she is likely to face questions from opposition MPs in the Commons at some point.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asked whether Prime Minister Rishi Sunak believed MI5 had confidence in Ms Braverman, his official spokesperson said: &#8220;Yes, the home secretary continues to have strong relationships with all the operational bodies that report into the Home Office and are focused very much on keeping the country safe.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Asked if Mr Sunak was concerned security analysts might be reluctant to share information with the Home Office, the official said: &#8220;No, and any suggestion of that would be entirely false.&#8221;</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Separately, opposition parties and some Tory MPs have also questioned Ms Braverman&#8217;s reappointment as home secretary after she admitted sending an official document to someone not authorised to receive it.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>She stepped down from her cabinet position on 19th October 2022, and after admitting two breaches of the ministerial code by sending confidential material via a private email account. She admitted committing a &#8220;technical infringement&#8221; of the rules.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;I have made a mistake; I accept responsibility; I resign,&#8221; she wrote in her resignation letter.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>However, just six days later Mr Sunak reappointed Ms Braverman as home secretary.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>It came two days after Ms Braverman had thrown her support behind him in the contest to replace Ms Truss, in what was widely seen as a significant endorsement by an influential figure on the right of the Conservative Party.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Labour leader Sir Keir Starmer accused the new prime minister of giving Ms Braverman a job in exchange for her support.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Both Labour and the Liberal Democrats have called for inquiries into Ms Braverman&#8217;s appointment.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>Jake Berry &#8211; who served as party chairman under Ms Truss but was fired by Mr Sunak &#8211; has also questioned Ms Braverman&#8217;s return to the cabinet, saying there had been &#8220;multiple breaches&#8221; of the rules.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>He told Talk TV that Ms Braverman had sent a document &#8220;from a private email address to another MP, she then sought to copy in that individual&#8217;s wife but accidentally sent it to a staffer in Parliament&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;To me, that seems to be a really serious breach &#8211; the cabinet secretary had his say at the time. I doubt he has changed his mind in the last six days,&#8221; he added.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>New party chairman Nadhim Zahawi defended Ms Braverman&#8217;s reappointment, saying he believed in &#8220;redemption&#8221;.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>&#8220;The prime minister looked at this case and he decided to give her a second chance,&#8221; he added.</p>\n<p>The post <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.asianexpress.co.uk/2022/10/suella-braverman-admits-using-private-emails-for-official-papers-six-times/\">Suella Braverman admits using private emails for official papers six times</a> appeared first on <a rel=\"nofollow\" href=\"https://www.asianexpress.co.uk\">Asian Express Newspaper</a>.</p>\n",
