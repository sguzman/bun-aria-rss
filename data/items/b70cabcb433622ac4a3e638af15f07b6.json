  "description": "<p>For this bonus episode, I&rsquo;m excited to share my conversation with New York Times journalist and The Daily co-host, Sabrina Tavernise. Sabrina recently spent three weeks in Ukraine and has delivered a series of dispatches offering a searing glimpse of what life is like there right now on the frontlines. Her time in the region actually extends all the way back to the 1990s when she first made her way to Russia as a freelance journalist and then as a foreign correspondent for the New York Times based in Moscow. So much of the coverage of the war in Ukraine concentrates on the day to day, but I really wanted to take advantage of Sabrina&rsquo;s rich perspective and sophisticated understanding of the region. So, for this conversation, we<em> dug deep</em> and covered everything from what life was like in Russia just after the wall came down and Putin&rsquo;s rise to power to how Russians today perceive this war and how things might play out in the months ahead. I hope you enjoy our talk as much as I did&hellip;.(oh, and if you hear barking, Sabrina&rsquo;s dog Clementine also made an appearance!)</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
