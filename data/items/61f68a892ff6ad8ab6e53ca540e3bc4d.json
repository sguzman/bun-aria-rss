  "description": "On today’s show, I welcome back Lenore Hawkins, chief macro strategist for Tematica Research. Lenore joins me from Italy to break down the problems surrounding the fourth-largest European nation…   She covers short and immediate-term issues, including super-high sovereign debt, slowing growth, and a new political regime that she refers to as “jokers.” Lenore also explains why a crash in this country would have a far greater impact on the global economy than Greece, Turkey, and Brexit. In my educational segment [53:07], I break down my trip to the Silver & Gold Summit in San Francisco. I’ll give you the scoop on my one-on-one meetings with industry legends… a huge catalyst that could push mining stocks up tremendously in the short term... and some of my favorite stock ideas in this beat-up space. I’ll also discuss the huge interest in security tokens following my presentation. We’ve given you a peek  behind the scenes of our operation here at Curzio… And now we can offer you the chance to become an insider.",
