  "description": "In Episode #219, I sit down with Layne Norton, PhD to answer one very topical question: does insulin make us fat?\nWelcome to the first bite-sized episode of The Proof. In these short conversations, I am joined by a guest to tackle a single topic in a brief, digestible time frame. In this episode, Layne Norton, PhD addresses recent online claims by Ben Bikman, PhD. Dr Bikman claims that if we keep insulin low and control seed oils, fat cells can stay smaller and healthier. But is there any truth to this claim, and would that necessarily be a good thing?\nIn this episode, Dr Norton takes a highly scientific approach to the topic at hand. We discuss adipocyte hypertrophy, the difference between and significance of hypertrophy versus hyperplasia, and the consequences of misinformation. We also examine the uses and drawbacks of mechanistic data.\n\nSpecifically, we cover:\n\nIntro (0:00)\n\nDr. Bikman’s Claims (2:24)\n\nHyperplasia and hypertrophy (7:19)\n\nGap of Research (12:17)\n\nWhy this is problematic (15:56)\n\nMotives (20:14)\n\nOutro (22:53)\n\n\nTo connect with Layne Norton, PhD, you can find him on Instagram and Twitter @biolayne, and on Facebook as Layne Norton.
