  "description": "<p>Recently author/professor Karen Swallow Prior was asked what she considered the biggest problem facing the church today, and answered, \"an impoverished imagination.\" So Phil sat down with Karen to talk through what she means by that, and her belief that a lack of imagination-forming reading results in, among other things, our propensity to believe conspiracy theories and our extreme discomfort with uncertainty. Karen also convinces Phil he really, really needs to read Mary Shelley's Frankenstein. PLUS, Kaitlyn Schiess joins Skye and Phil to talk through Beth Moore's departure from the SBC, and whether the death of evangelist Luis Palau represents the end of the era of large-scale evangelism. Oh... and if you're using the story of Jesus flipping tables to justify bad behavior on social media, you're probably misusing that story. This week on the podcast!</p> <p><a class=\"c-link\" href= \"https://religionnews.com/2021/03/09/bible-teacher-beth-moore-ends-partnership-with-lifeway-i-am-no-longer-a-southern-baptist/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link= \"https://religionnews.com/2021/03/09/bible-teacher-beth-moore-ends-partnership-with-lifeway-i-am-no-longer-a-southern-baptist/\" data-sk= \"tooltip_parent\">https://religionnews.com/2021/03/09/bible-teacher-beth-moore-ends-partnership-with-lifeway-i-am-no-longer-a-southern-baptist/</a></p> <p><a class=\"c-link\" href= \"https://frenchpress.thedispatch.com/p/cruelty-is-apostasy\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link= \"https://frenchpress.thedispatch.com/p/cruelty-is-apostasy\" data-sk=\"tooltip_parent\">https://frenchpress.thedispatch.com/p/cruelty-is-apostasy</a></p> <p><a class=\"c-link\" href= \"https://www.relevantmagazine.com/faith/jesus-flipping-tables-isnt-excuse-your-online-rants/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" data-stringify-link= \"https://www.relevantmagazine.com/faith/jesus-flipping-tables-isnt-excuse-your-online-rants/\" data-sk= \"tooltip_parent\">https://www.relevantmagazine.com/faith/jesus-flipping-tables-isnt-excuse-your-online-rants/</a></p>",
