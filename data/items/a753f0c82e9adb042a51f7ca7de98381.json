We walk through some strategies for dealing with off-putting comments and moving forward in a positive way. We also share details about Quilts of Honor, our fave tools for hand-embroidery, and a fun binding trend we're seeing.\nFor more resources from today's show, visit the show notes here: https://www.allpeoplequilt.com/magazines-more/quilting-podcast/episode-572-how-to-overcome-outer-judgement\nEmail us at APQPodcast@meredith.com.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
