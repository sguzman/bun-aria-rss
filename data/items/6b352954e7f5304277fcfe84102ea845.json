  "description": "<p>Sure you’ve heard the term- you know that capitalism is the primary economic system here in the United States, but is it the best option? And especially as of late, capitalism seems to be getting dragged through the mud. Depending on what you’re reading and who you’re listening to, you might be beginning to think that capitalism is the worst! However, we believe it’s actually a force for good and is an idea and concept that many fail to appreciate. Similar to the undervalued baseball players that Billy Beane scouted for the A’s to turn around their club, or something as simple as dental floss when it comes to taking care of your teeth- capitalism isn’t sexy, but it gets the job done. While we don’t think it’s the perfect solution, we’re going to spend this episode breaking down capitalism, why we think it works, and then what this means for us as individuals.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Bourbon Barrel Brick Kiln by Jackie O’s!
