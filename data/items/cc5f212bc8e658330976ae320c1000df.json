    "media:description": "Sentaces is disabled and homeless. Her rare skin condition causes open wounds on every part of her body. Sentaces receives $800 a month that mostly goes to live-saving medicine. She is anxious to share her story, but wants others to know the truth about being disabled in the USA.\n\nSentaces diagnosis is epidermolytic hyperkeratosis ichthyosis bullosa.\n\nWe created a PO Box for Sentaces. The address is:\n1345 N Jefferson St. # 389 \nMilwaukee, WI\n53202-2657\n\nConnect with Sentaces at https://www.instagram.com/Serena_beautty/\n\nSentaces told me she has never received mail and hopes people will take the time to write her. Some products that would be useful to her are Aquaphor, Eczema body wash , Baby oil (cocoa butter), Vaseline , Shea butter, cocoa butter gel, clothes preferably large or 1 x clothes, detergents or clothe strips.",
