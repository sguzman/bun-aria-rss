Biden&rsquo;s off-the-cuff remark at a Democrat fundraiser in California the evening before has already drawn condemnations from Tehran.</p>\n<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;Don&rsquo;t worry, we&rsquo;re going to free Iran. They&rsquo;re going to free themselves pretty soon,&rdquo;</em> Biden told those attending a party fundraiser at MiraCosta College near San Diego on Thursday.</p>\n<p><strong></strong>He was <em>&ldquo;expressing our solidarity with the protesters,&rdquo;</em> Kirby told the White House press corps the following day, adding that any change of government in Tehran <em>&ldquo;has to be up to the people of Iran.\"</em></p>\n<p><strong></strong>Asked if Biden&rsquo;s comments reflected Washington&rsquo;s assessment that the Iranian government is near collapse, Kirby said <em>&ldquo;We have no indication of that.&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p><strong></strong><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/565951-iran-revolution-free-biden/\"></a></p>\n\n            \n    <blockquote>\n        <span><strong>Read more</strong></span>\n        <figure>\n            <img src=\"https://mf.b37mrtl.ru/files/2022.11/thumbnail/636511a72030277c925e1700.jpg\" alt=\"Ebrahim Raisi addresses the crowd during an annual demonstration in front of the former US Embassy in Tehran, Iran, November 4, 2022\" />\n            <figcaption><a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/565951-iran-revolution-free-biden/\">Tehran responds to Biden’s ‘Iran will free itself’ comment</a></figcaption>\n        </figure>\n    </blockquote>\n\n    \n\n<p>Speaking on Friday, Iranian President Ebrahim Raisi addressed Biden&rsquo;s remarks by referring to the 1979 Islamic revolution in Tehran, which overthrew the pro-US monarchy&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong></strong><em>&ldquo;I&rsquo;m telling Biden that Iran was freed 43 years ago,&rdquo;</em> said Raisi.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong></strong>Tehran has accused the US and its allies of instigating a wave of anti-government protests that started in mid-September, ostensibly over the death of a young woman in police custody.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Iranian Foreign Minister Hossein Amir-Abdollahian said the White House <em>&ldquo;has increasingly promoted violence and terror in the recent riots,&rdquo;</em> calling on the US to <em>&ldquo;stop hypocritical behavior.&rdquo;</em></p>\n<p><strong></strong>This is not the first time Biden&rsquo;s aides have sought to <em>&ldquo;clarify&rdquo;</em> their boss&rsquo;s remarks. Speaking about Russian President Vladimir Putin in March, Biden said <em>&ldquo;For God&rsquo;s sake, this man cannot remain in power,&rdquo;</em> which was widely interpreted as calling for regime change in Moscow &ndash; only for this to be <a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/552810-us-denies-russia-regime-change-strategy/\">denied</a> by the State Department and White House aides.</p>\n<p><strong></strong>Within 48 hours, Biden <a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/552867-biden-putin-regime-change/\">himself said</a> he was &ldquo;<em>not walking anything back,&rdquo;</em> but was not <em>&ldquo;articulating a policy change,&rdquo;</em> only <em>&ldquo;expressing moral outrage that I feel,&rdquo;</em> and could not believe his words were taken seriously.</p>",
