So not only is she a CFP with her own business, not only has she won gold as an Olympic athlete, but Lauryn is also a Certified Student Loan Professional, a CSLP, so she also has a high level of expertise when it comes to all things student loans. We’re going to hear Lauryn’s Olympic story but we’re also going to dig into some important details that student loan borrowers need to keep in mind when it comes to things like forbearance, student loan forgiveness, and the different income-driven repayment plans.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed The Donkey and the Thistle by Mad Fritz- thanks to our friend Cal for donating this one to the show!
