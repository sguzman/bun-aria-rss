  "description": "<p><p>War has broken out in the Kirk Minihane World. Minifan Show Host MHB, following his poetic decapitation at the hands of Minihane's producer, is rattled but bent on revenge. The first week of The Greg Hill Show on WEEI has been a wild success -- for Minihane. Arch nemesis Shirley Leung, an activist who works for the Boston Globe, has returned with her second \"This is Racist\" column of the week. Now, the Boston Herald is in her crosshairs over a punny front-page splash. War of Roses returns. Minihane's ominous ending note will linger over the weekend. </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
