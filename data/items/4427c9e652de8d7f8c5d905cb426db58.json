  "description": "<p>Tig and Sheng Wang, comedian and writer on ABC’s “Fresh Off the Boat,” trade stories about their childhoods in Houston, post-apocalyptic hairstyles, and pickleball moves. Then Tig and Sheng advise a runner whose partner would rather go to a comedy show than watch her run her first marathon, and they counsel a single woman who has the unbelievable “problem” of finding too many good matches on a dating app. </p>\n<p>This episode is sponsored by BetterHelp (go to Betterhelp.com/TIG for 10% off the first month of online therapy), Shopify (go to Shopify.com/TIG for a free trial), Rocket Money (go to Rocket Money.com/tig and start canceling unwanted subscriptions today), Indeed (go to Indeed.com/TIG to start hiring now; terms and conditions apply), and WealthFront (go to WealthFront.com/TIG to get your first $5,000 managed for free).</p>\n<p>Need advice?
