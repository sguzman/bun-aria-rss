  "description": "<p>Tara is away this week. Enjoy a favorite talk from 12/9/2009. Spiritual practice reveals our belonging through bringing presence to three gateways: the aliveness of the present moment, loving relatedness, and the openness and lucidity of awareness itself. This talk includes guided meditations in exploring each gateway. <strong>Note:</strong> poem, <a href=\"http://writersalmanac.publicradio.org/index.php?date=2009/10/30\">\"She Dreamed of Cows\" is by Norah Pollard</a>.</p>",
