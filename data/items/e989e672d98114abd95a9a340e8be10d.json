    "media:description": "A few years ago, Netflix embarked on a journey to rethink continuous delivery from the ground up. We wanted to enable developers to focus more on their products and less on delivery and infrastructure management. Managed Delivery was introduced to address this problem. In this presentation, we share a brief review of Managed Delivery and cover plans for the future with Kubernetes at Netflix. Recorded at the AWS Open Source Symposium in San Francisco, March 2022.",
