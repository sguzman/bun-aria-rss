  "description": "<p>What a wild one we have today. I set out, fascinated by his two escapes from prison, to only explore cartel leader El Chapo. And then I got sucked into the history of the War on Drugs. And what a crazy history it is. Saying drugs are bad and that's why they're illegal is to vastly oversimplify US drug policy. Does the War on Drugs make any sense at all to fight? Can it actually be won? Does it actually make things much, much worse and create a lot of additional crime? Even if you don't agree with me, I hope you find today's episode interesting and thought-provoking. Sinaloa Cartel leader Joaquín \"El Chapo\" Guzmán Loera certainly led an interesting life. <br /><br />Thanks for helping Bad Magic Productions donate at least $12,500 this month to<strong> The Saint</strong> <strong>Bernard Project.</strong> The SBP will be helping those in Texas, Oklahoma and Louisiana as they continue to work on their recovery from winter storm Uri.
