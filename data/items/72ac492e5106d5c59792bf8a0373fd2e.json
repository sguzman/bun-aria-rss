  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">How do you become a more mindful leader? Whether you’re a student, parent or entrepreneur, how do you lead yourself and how do you lead others for a place of mindful connection and development?</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Representative Tim Ryan recently announced his run for president and has a long history representing working-class families in Ohio. What you might not know about Tim is that in addition to his service as a Congressman, Tim is an advocate for mindfulness, meditation, and health and is the author</span> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">of two books on mindfulness and healthy food.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Mindfulness and leadership are two of the most important words today. We’re living through fractured, disrupted times and calm thoughtful leaders will be essential in guiding communities back toward connectedness, imagination, and change. Unless we learn to reconnect with each other and work together, we will remain unable to solve the many problems facing us.  </span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">In this conversation, we discuss how mindfulness impacts our brains, and how adverse experiences impact the minds of younger generations coming up through our schools. We speak about how mindfulness has given the best leaders the strength to lead and maintain calm through challenging times and find the imagination to lead the country out of a challenge and towards change. Lastly, we talk about why social connectedness is so important in today’s fractured society and why the world needs you to take all the self-work you’ve been doing and start passing it on to your community.</span></p> <p class=\"p1\">** Do you want to stay up to date with every new episode and get my brand new Kwik Brain Accelerator Program?
