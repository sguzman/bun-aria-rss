  "description": "<p>Charlie reflects on the popular vote loss of Jair Bolsonaro's in Brazil to convicted criminal and communist Lula da Silva. But what actually led to Bolsonaro's loss when he won the vote in every single region except for one, and how has the structure of America's constitutional republic, for hundreds of years, helped save America from small but populous areas of the country controlling the rest? Next, columnist and commentator Chadwick Moore joins the show for the first time to talk about his journey to leaving the left as a civil libertarian gay man, and joining the center right. He also discusses his brand new book that many in the audience can most definitely relate to: \"So You've Been Sent to Diversity Training: Smiling Through the DEI Apocalypse\". Chadwick also chimes in on the Paul Pelosi saga from his unique vantage point. </p><p><a href=\"http://www.charliekirk.com/support\" rel=\"payment\">Support the show: http://www.charliekirk.com/support</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
