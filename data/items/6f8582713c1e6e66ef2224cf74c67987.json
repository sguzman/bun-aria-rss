  "title": "#51 - Murder Ruins A Garden Party - The Passionateness of Marc Cecillon",
  "description": "<p>This week, we look at a man who was a hero to his country, but devolved into a sad tale of alcohol, rage, depression, and finally violence. He seemed like a happy, party guy, who rode his Harley through the French Alps, but his demons couldn't be held down, finally culminating in a most violent, and even more public act. This story is a crazy ride, that will leave you wondering just how some people in his home country can still worship this guy. Come for the crime, stay for the boys mispronouncing at least a dozen French cities! Jump on a motorcycle, drink yourself into incoherency, and commit a public act of violence with Marc Cecillon!! Check us out, every Tuesday. We will continue to bring you the biggest idiots in sports history!</p><p>Hosted by James Pietragallo & Jimmie Whisman</p><p><br> </p><p>New episodes every Tuesday!!</p><p>Please subscribe, rate, and review!</p><p>Listen on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, or wherever you listen to podcasts!</p><p>Head to<a href=\"http://shutupandgivememurder.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> shutupandgivememurder.com</a> for all things Crime in Sports!</p><p>For merchandise:<a href=\"http://crimeinsports.threadless.com/\" target=\"_blank\"> crimeinsports.threadless.com</a></p><p>Check out James and Jimmie's other show: Small Town Murder</p><p> </p><p>Follow us on social media!</p><p>Facebook:<a href=\"http://facebook.com/crimeinsports\" target=\"_blank\"> facebook.com/crimeinsports</a></p><p>Instagram:<a href=\"http://instagram.com/smalltownmurder\" target=\"_blank\"> instagram.com/smalltownmurder</a></p><p>Twitter:<a href=\"http://twitter.com/CrimeInSports\" target=\"_blank\"> twitter.com/MurderSmall</a></p><p> </p><p>Contact the show: <a href=\"mailto:crimeinsports@gmail.com\" target=\"_blank\">crimeinsports@gmail.com</a></p><p>Donate on Patreon: patreon.com/crimeinsports</p><p>PayPal: paypal.me/crimeinsports</p>\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
