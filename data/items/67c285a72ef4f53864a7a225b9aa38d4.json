  "title": "Andy Dalton signs with Cowboys, Bears decline Mitchell Trubisky's 5th-year option (Football 5/4)",
  "description": "\"Andy Dalton makes a lot of sense for the Cowboys\" - John Breech on Thursday's episode. Well, Saturday night Dallas decided they agreed and signed the veteran quarterback to a one-year deal (4:35). The Pick Six Superfriends dissect Dalton's new home and how the move affects Dak Prescott, who is still without a long-term contract. The guys highlight the importance of backup QBs and toss out some mildly wild trade scenarios (20:30). Will Brinson, Ryan Wilson, John Breech and Sean Wagner-McGough briefly comment on the Patriots quarterback situation (28:30), before taking a look at the 5th-year option deadline. Mitch Trubisky (31:45) as well of 4 of the Top 5 picks from 2017 had their options declined. Why did that year have such a miss rate at the top? Can we really blame other teams for passing on Patrick Mahomes (44:45)?\n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox, Bullhorn and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nFollow the Pick Six team on Twitter: @picksixpod, @willbrinson, @ryanwilsonCBS, @JohnBreech, @seanjwagner\nCheck out the Pick Six Instagram page https://www.instagram.com/picksixpod/?hl=en\nJoin our Facebook group https://www.facebook.com/groups/758548147935545/\nFor more NFL coverage from CBS Sports, visit https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/\nTo hear more from the CBS Sports Podcast Network, visit https://www.cbssports.com/podcasts/\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
