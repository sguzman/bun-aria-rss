  "description": "With a new earnings season kicking off next week… the latest inflation data releasing on the 13th… and a Fed meeting later this month, the markets are in waiting mode. Daniel Creech joins me today to break it all down…  As Daniel explains, the Fed has painted itself into a corner with the U.S. debt load… and we may see an interest rate cut early next year. I share my prediction for when the Fed will stop its rate hikes… and why that’s bullish for the economy.  The Fed’s efforts to bring down inflation are working… as commodity prices (including oil) are coming down as interest rates rise. Daniel and I debate where prices are headed next. One of us is buying oil stocks right now… while the other expects more pain ahead.
