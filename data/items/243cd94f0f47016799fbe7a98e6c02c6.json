Along the way, I successfully helped raise two young boys. Sure, I made many mistakes. But I also did a few things right. Today they are both amazing young men.

That quest continuously referred me to one notable expert: Lisa Damour, PhD.</p><p>A teen whisperer par excellence, Lisa is a Yale educated psychotherapist with a doctorate in Clinical Psychology&nbsp;from the University of Michigan who specializes in education and child development.
