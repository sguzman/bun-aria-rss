  "description": "<p>The opioid crisis in the United States now rivals the Vietnam War in terms of how many Americans have been killed. After calling the opioid crisis a national emergency, President Trump has officially declared it a public health emergency — a distinction with a difference. We speak with a recovering addict who was 14 when he tried oxycodone for the first time.  “By everyone’s standards, I should be dead,” he said about his former drug dependency. Guests: Aaron Pope, who lives outside Lexington, Ky.; <a href=\"https://www.nytimes.com/by/julie-hirschfeld-davis\" target=\"_blank\">Julie Hirschfeld Davis</a>, a White House correspondent for The Times.
