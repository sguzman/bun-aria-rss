In fact, 81% of retailers and 75% of e-commerce companies plan to increase their investment in promoting their mobile apps over the next 12 months.<footnote id=\"770168b9-7c8a-4b03-9a68-4495eb3fcd10\">[770168]</footnote>That’s why we’re introducing new tools to help you more accurately measure cross-platform conversions, strengthen campaign performance with privacy-focused measurement and adapt to shifts in platform standards on iOS and Android.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><h3 data-block-key=\"dn7h2\">Set up cross-platform conversion measurement</h3></div></div><div class=\"block-image_full_width\"><div class=\"h-c-page\"><div class=\"article-image h-c-grid__col--10 h-c-grid__col--offset-1 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-l--8\"><a class=\"article-image--link\"><video alt=\"W2AC\" autoplay=\"\" class=\"article-image__media\" loop=\"\" muted=\"\" playsinline=\"\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/original_videos/W2AC_GIF.mp4\" tabindex=\"0\" title=\"Screen grab of the Web to App Connect interface, featuring tools to guide advertisers through conversion tracking and deep linking set up\" type=\"video/mp4\">Video format not supported</video></a></div></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"dn7h2\">People search across various sites and apps before taking action, with the average consumer switching five times between mobile web and apps in a 30 minute-session<footnote id=\"8a20efc8-b41c-4265-b808-8ca8164e8b59\">[8a20ef]</footnote>. Without cross-platform <a href=\"https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/1722022\">conversion tracking</a>, you’ll have measurement gaps and limit optimization across your web and app campaigns. To help advertisers more easily set up conversion tracking, we’ve been alpha testing <a href=\"https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/12131000\">Web to App Connect</a>, a toolkit that guides advertisers through the process step by step.</p><p data-block-key=\"bo5co\">It’s also essential to prioritize frictionless web-to-app experiences for customers that already have your app — which you can do with deep linking. For example, let’s say a customer is searching for new shoes on her mobile browser and sees your ad. With deep linking, she will land on the in-app product page and can check out faster, improving the customer experience and driving better campaign performance. On average, advertisers who have implemented deep linking are seeing over 2X uplift in conversion rate.<footnote id=\"1ebf6706-480b-4fd0-bac4-2be887fcc59a\">[1ebf67]</footnote>Creating this smooth experience requires technical implementation, and Web to App Connect offers tools to help simplify this workflow.</p><p data-block-key=\"hm4v\">Canadian Tire, one of the leading retailers in Canada, has already seen success implementing optimized experiences with Web to App Connect.</p></div></div><div class=\"block-pull_quote\"><div class=\"uni-pull-quote h-c-page\"><section class=\"h-c-grid\"><div class=\"uni-pull-quote__wrapper h-c-grid__col h-c-grid__col--8 h-c-grid__col-m--6 h-c-grid__col-l--6 h-c-grid__col--offset-2 h-c-grid__col-m--offset-3 h-c-grid__col-l--offset-3\"><div class=\"uni-pull-quote__inner-wrapper h-c-copy h-c-copy\"><q class=\"uni-pull-quote__text\">Web to App Connect made it easier for my team to collaborate with our developers to ensure our app users aren’t having clunky experiences.</q> <cite class=\"uni-pull-quote__author\"><figure class=\"uni-pull-quote__author-photo\"><picture><source media=\"(max-resolution: 1.5dppx)\" sizes=\"48px\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/ctlogo2022-100.max-100x100.png 48w\"/><source media=\"(min-resolution: 1.5dppx)\" sizes=\"89px\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/ctlogo2022-100.max-100x100.png 89w\"/><img alt=\"ctlogo2022-100\" data-target=\"image\" loading=\"lazy\" sizes=\" 48px,  89px\" src=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/ctlogo2022-100.max-100x100.png\" srcset=\"https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/ctlogo2022-100.max-100x100.png 48w, https://storage.googleapis.com/gweb-uniblog-publish-prod/images/ctlogo2022-100.max-100x100.png 89w\"/></picture></figure><span class=\"uni-pull-quote__author-meta\"><strong class=\"h-u-font-weight-medium\">Vera Bondareva</strong><br/> Marketing Manager, Canadian Tire</span></cite></div></div></section></div></div><div class=\"block-paragraph\"><div class=\"rich-text\"><p data-block-key=\"va4cb\">Web to App Connect will be available in beta early next year.

That’s why we’re supporting solutions that help advertisers navigate these changes, including the new <a href=\"https://developer.apple.com/app-store/ad-attribution/\">version 4.0 updates to SKAdNetwork</a>, Apple’s measurement API.</p><p data-block-key=\"1eh38\">Throughout 2023, we’re improving modeled reporting consistency for iOS app installs across measurement platforms in Google Ads. Next year, we’ll also release tools for advertisers using the Google Analytics for Firebase SDK, which streamline setting up SKAdNetwork conversion values and help better optimize their campaigns for in-app actions.</p><p data-block-key=\"1kur2\">Developing these new solutions will take time, but you can start taking steps today to get ahead. For example, to enhance conversion modeling and reporting accuracy, you can adopt <a href=\"https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/12119136\">on-device conversion measurement</a>, a privacy-preserving solution we released earlier this year. With on-device conversion measurement, user interactions with app ads can be matched to app conversions in a way that prevents user-identifying information from leaving a user's device. You can also start setting up SKAdNetwork conversion values yourself or work with a measurement partner, such as our <a href=\"https://ads.google.com/lp/appcampaigns/attribution\">App Attribution Partners</a>. Lastly, explore <a href=\"https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/10384955\">this guide</a> to learn more best practices for your iOS App campaigns.</p><p data-block-key=\"7ocj4\">And while nothing is changing today for Android App campaigns, we recently <a href=\"https://support.google.com/google-ads/answer/12791813\">provided an update</a> on our participation in the <a href=\"https://blog.google/products/android/introducing-privacy-sandbox-android/\">Privacy Sandbox on Android</a> initiative. We regularly share feedback with Android about its public proposals so that the new privacy-preserving technologies can help you reach the right audiences, and more accurately measure your campaign results with less reliance on tracking identifiers. And we’ll be sharing what we’ve learned throughout 2023 on the experiments we participate in.</p></div></div></body></html>",
