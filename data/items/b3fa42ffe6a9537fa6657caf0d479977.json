Mike offers the spectrum of “the ideal vs. the real.” What does that mean? How does God navigate the ideal He set up with the reality of the human stumble? How does the text accommodate to the view points of the time in which it’s written? How does this effect and shape theology? How do we interact with that? How is the human mess worked in? What are we to do with all of this???</p>\n<p>The complexity of the text is on display and it’s asking us to wrestle with it, to marinate in its mystery and wonder at God’s intentional back and forth with all of us.
