  "description": "<p>This week on the Cigar Authority we welcome to the show Mike LaRiviera the New England sales representative from Rocky Patel as we fire up a cigar from the care package; Rocky Patel LB1. We will sit down with Mike who is a retired police officer and ask him to get into our debate if you should inform an officer you are legally carrying when pulled over. We will also ask about breathalyzers and find out how you can get out of a ticket.. Dave will also ask Mike the 6 things you should never ask an officer of the law.</p>\n<p>In the second hour we will look at our predictions for the #25, #11 and #1 cigar from Cigar Aficionado. How did we do? Did any of us even come close? We will do this while we light up a second cigar that has yet to be determined.</p>\n<p>We will have this all the usual suspects including Versus, Offer of the Day, Cigar News and a peek into the Asylum. The Cigar Authority is a member of the United Podcast Network and is recorded live in front of a studio audience at Studio 21 Podcast Cafe upstairs at Two Guys Smoke Shop in Salem, NH and as always you can find many of the cigars we discuss at <a href='https://www.2guyscigars.com/'>http://www.2GuysCigars.com/</a>.</p>\n<p>Never miss an episode by subscribing to the show via <a href='http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-cigar-authority/id413869893?mt=2&ign-mpt=uo%3D4'>Apple Podcasts</a> and <a href='http://thecigarauthority.podbean.com/'>Podbean</a>.</p>\n",
