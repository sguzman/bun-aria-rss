  "itunes:summary": "In January of this year, Kamala Harris celebrated her impending inauguration as the Vice President of United States by gracing the cover of Vogue Magazine. While itâ€™s not uncommon for noteworthy female politicians to make the cover of Vogue, the cover actually gained notoriety for Vice President Harrisâ€™ presentation. Appearing washed out and poorly lit, the cover instantly stirred controversy with commenters questioning how the worldâ€™s most prestigious fashion magazine could print a cover of the second most powerful politician on the planet looking decidedly â€˜un-Vogueâ€™ and even messy.\nWhile many would be shocked, scholars of race and critics of the fashion industry however were quick to highlight how the controversy surrounding Vice President Harrisâ€™ Vogue cover was only the most recent example of the ways in which the fashion and beauty industries have long been out of touch with any standard of beauty beyond whiteness. From technical aspects like lighting and make-up, to fundamental knowledge of palettes and undertones, within the industry of beauty there is a long and troublesome tradition of reifying intersectional forms of exclusion through the construction of standards of beauty that continue to this day to be based on a standard of whiteness. And it would seem that not even the Vice President of the United States is immune to it.\nOn this weekâ€™s episode of the podcast, we discuss these issues and more with Amanda Roberts. Amanda is a PhD candidate and instructor with Carleton Universityâ€™s Department of Political Science specializing in political theory and intersectional feminism. She is also the mind behind the beauty blog Amanda Glowgetter, a lifestyle blog focusing issues of race, beauty, and mental health and well-being.
