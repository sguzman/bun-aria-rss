We cover Ailee’s long awaited comeback album, EXO Baekhyun’s solo debut, Heize’s new hit “We Don’t Talk Together” which was produced by Suga of BTS, and Melomance’s “You & I.” Eric and resident jingle-provider Brian also give incredibly unqualified and poorly researched life advice to our listeners.
