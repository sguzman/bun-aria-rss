  "description": "Our audiobook this week is Spade’s Queen by Loni Ree\n\nI run my own little kingdom with my three best friends-Wild Aces.\n\nOne look at her and I take a blow right to the chest. I’m not even sure she’s real. As my world instantly changes, everything in the room disappears except for her.\n\nJace Spade\n\nI have one little problem-it’s obvious she’s too young to be in my bar. My heart doesn’t care. This girl belongs to me and I’ll find a way to deal with the obstacles.\n\nI’m not thinking clearly when I leave her alone in my office. Why didn’t I get her name? My little spitfire disappears into the night, taking my heart with her.\n\nDani\n\nThat was close. I’m never letting my friends talk me into sneaking into bars again. Between college classes and my job at the local coffee shop, I don’t have time to spend a weekend in jail. Although the hot bar-owner did make my palms sweaty and my heart race. Too bad, he was about to have me locked up.\n\nAfter weeks of searching, a chance meeting brings Dani back into Spade’s life. This time, he won’t let her slip away. He’s going to fight for his girl and make her his queen.\n\nIf you like over-the-top, insta-love romance with a little bit of humor, this short romance is the perfect story for you.\n\nGet the eBook for SPADE&#039;S QUEEN» https://amzn.to/3cCbruz\n\nOther Books Mentioned\nKing’s Captive Amber Bardan https://amzn.to/39HXcmo\nBe Mine Or Else by Alexa Riley https://bit.ly/2LdBOfb\nFilthy Rich Americans by Nikkie Sloane https://amzn.to/3jnRoBP\n209 Wedding Lane by Lucy Darling https://amzn.to/3pKJB35\n\nRMR Website: https://bit.ly/3ifFIyw\nWeekly New Release: https://bit.ly/30iDete\nFollow Read Me Romance on Instagram: https://geni.us/uUVdVeY\nJoin Read Me Romance Headquarters on FB: https://geni.us/IdL7B\nFind Alexa Riley on Instagram: https://bit.ly/2HGrxpQ\n\nRead Me Romance Theme Song by L.B.
