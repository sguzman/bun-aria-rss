    "media:description": "The wealthy get a sendup and a send-off in “Triangle of Sadness,” the latest feature from the Swedish director Ruben Ostlund, now in theaters.\n\nThe film begins in the fashion world, following an influencer-model couple (Charlbi Dean and Harris Dickinson). The two get a free cruise on a luxury yacht, where they meet an assembly of very rich passengers. But things take a turn in the third act, when a smattering of those passengers turn up shipwrecked on an island.\n\nIn this sequence, the characters, having spent an eerie first night on the island, wake up to see a lifeboat with only one person inside: Abigail (Dolly De Leon), who was a cleaning lady on the yacht.\n\n“What was important for me,” Ostlund said, “was that I wanted to swap the power structures on the island. I wanted to turn them upside-down.” This scene begins that gradual change in the hierarchy, as Abigail, who has arrived with sustenance (as well as practical skills), begins to realize that she may have a currency on the island that she didn’t have before.\n\nRead the New York Times review: https://nyti.ms/3SBHb4J\n&#13;\nSubscribe: http://bit.ly/U8Ys7n&#13;\nMore from The New York Times Video:  http://nytimes.com/video&#13;\n----------&#13;\nWhether it's reporting on conflicts abroad and political divisions at home, or covering the latest style trends and scientific developments, New York Times video journalists provide a revealing and unforgettable view of the world.
