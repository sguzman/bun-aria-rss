  "description": "<p>Every great leader knows that there is no finish line––growth does not have a destination. The moment a leader believes they have “arrived” is the moment a leader stops growing. In this episode, John Maxwell talks about the importance of being a continual learner and shares ten components of a life-long learner.</p> <p>During the application portion of this episode, Mark Cole and Traci Morrow dive into how they apply these principles to their own lives. Mark teaches us that the greatest thing we can offer the world is a version of ourselves that is most fully alive.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this episode is the “How to Become a Life-Long Learner Worksheet,” which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching. You can download the worksheet by visiting MaxwellPodcast.com/Learner and clicking “Download the Bonus Resource.”</p> <p>References:</p> <p><a href= \"https://johnmaxwell.com/growth\">JohnMaxwell.com/Growth</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://store.johnmaxwell.com/The-21-Irrefutable-Laws-of-Leadership--Follow-Them-and-People-Will-Follow-You-10th-Anniversary-Edition-Hardcover_p_2780.html\"> <em>The 21 Irrefutable Laws of Leadership</em> by John C.
