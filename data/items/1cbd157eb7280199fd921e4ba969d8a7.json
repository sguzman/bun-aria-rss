  "description": "<p>If I asked you to recall a time that you learned a lesson from a mistake you made, I bet you’d be quick to answer. That’s what our lives are—a series of trials and errors, and a constant opportunity to grow and learn. But luckily, we don’t always have to learn the hard way. If you’re observant and open-minded, you can take away profound lessons from the people around you.<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p>For me, Jay Ferruggia is one of those people. Whether we’re talking about fitness, sharpening your public speaking skills, or simply being a kinder and more patient human, Jay has a ton of inspiration to share. When Jay posted a list of 45 lessons he’s learned in 45 years, I knew I wanted to share it with you.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p>On today’s show, Jay Ferruggia is here to discuss some of the life-changing principles that have helped him become a stronger, healthier, and more successful human being. You’ll learn about building functional strength, reframing your problems in order to create healthier relationships, and how to have a succinct mission that directly changes the world around you.
