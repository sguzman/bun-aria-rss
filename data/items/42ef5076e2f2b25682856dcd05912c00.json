  "description": "<p>You don’t have to be a millionaire to be a successful real estate investor. Chad Carson, our $Pro this week, is here to explain how even a small, effective real estate portfolio can lead to reaching your financial goals in a short period of time. He illustrates this with an example of a couple reaching financial independence with only five properties, not hundreds! Having greater financial freedom and flexibility with your time will be the natural outcome of focusing on your goals, and carefully investing in real estate can take you there.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Primordial Noir by Cascade Brewing which you can find and learn all about on Untappd. A massive thanks for Alex in Oregon for donating this beer to the show!
