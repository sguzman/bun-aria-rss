  "description": "<p>Investing for your retirement is way simpler and easier than you think- and I'm going to prove it. Do these 2 things and you'll be a millionaire by the time you retire (I'm not even exaggerating one bit!):</p><p><strong>1. Open your retirement accounts:</strong>401k – If your employer offers a retirement plan like a 401k, especially with a match, start contributing immediately!!! Since a ton of employers offer a 50% match, you won't be able to find a better return on your investment anywhere. At the very least contribute up to your employer match, or you can really get after it and fully fund it at $18,500.IRA – Next thing to consider is opening an IRA (individual retirement account), specifically a ROTH IRA given the recent changes in tax law. This is not an employer offered retirement plan, so anyone can open one of these accounts. It's as easy as opening a savings account online, no joke. The only downside to the IRA is that your contributions are limited at $5,500 per year (but don't forget you can open a spousal IRA too, so $11,000 combined!). We <strong>highly</strong> recommend <a href=\"https://investor.vanguard.com/home/\">Vanguard</a>.<strong>2. Start investing:</strong>Take Warren Buffett's timeless advice and only buy funds or etfs that are widely diversified and have low expense ratios (like around .05%).Joel is 100% invested in <a href=\"https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0585&FundIntExt=INT&from=mfsResults&funds_disable_redirect=true\">VTSAX</a> and I'm 100% invested in <a href=\"https://personal.vanguard.com/us/funds/snapshot?FundId=0968&FundIntExt=INT&funds_disable_redirect=true\">VOO</a>. Again we are both big fans of Vanguard but both Fidelity and Schwab have some good low-cost funds as well.Keep investing and don't stop. That's it!And at the beginning of this episode we cracked open a couple local brews by Ironmonger Brewing Company- Damascus IPA and Anvil DIPA which you can find and learn all about on Untappd.
