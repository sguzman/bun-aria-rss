  "description": "Happy birthday, Glenn Beck! While Glenn and Stu realize they’re getting older, Joe Biden is older and crankier than ever. But will he drop out of the 2020 race if he comes in fifth in New Hampshire? Buttigieg won Iowa by a small margin, and Barack Obama won an Oscar for his socialist-sounding documentary. And China is cracking down on the coronavirus as only a communist regime would. Satellite data could suggest a huge number of bodies are being burned, but nothing is certain coming out of China. BlazeTV’s Jon Miller discusses his controversial tweet about the Oscar win for “Parasite” and “woke” Hollywood. And Rudy Giuliani and the Senate are looking into the “smoking gun” we unearthed in “Ukraine: The Final Piece.”\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
