  "description": "Given what we now know about the mind’s connection with brain activity, and that brain activity, being normal physical activity, apparently must be determined by physical laws, is it possible to say we have free will anymore? If so, in what way? If not, what are the implications?  And what is free will anyway? To discuss these and related questions, Grant Bartley from Philosophy Now is joined by Sam Coleman from the University of Hertfordshire, Norman Bacrac from the South Place Ethical Society and independent scholar Camilla Martin. First broadcast on 20 March 2012 on Resonance FM.",
