  "description": "Bitcoin is set to explode in price after the next halving in 2024 with many crypto experts projecting a minimum price target of $100,000 and according to cryptocurrency exchange Changelly, BTC might peak at around $937,000 in 2030, with an average trading price of $798,000 per coin.\n\n“We must think about the long-term implications of Bitcoin and Proof-of-Work cryptocurrencies. Once mined, this will be the next main store of value as gold once was. The halving is set to occur in 2024, and this will, by definition, increase the USD price of Bitcoin by quite a bit. For this reason, I believe this is the time to buy. Once the halving happens, BTC will be worth at least $100,000.”\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
