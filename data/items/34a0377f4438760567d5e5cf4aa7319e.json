In 1962, while working as a consulting scientist at <a href=\"https://www.ge.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">General Electric</a>’s Advanced Semiconductor Laboratory, he invented the first practical visible-spectrum LED. It is now used in light bulbs and lasers.\n</p><p>\n\tHolonyak left GE in 1963 to become a professor of electrical and computer engineering and researcher at his alma mater, the <a href=\"https://illinois.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">University of Illinois</a> Urbana-Champaign. He retired from the university in 2013.\n</p><hr/><p>\n\tHe received the 2003 <a href=\"https://corporate-awards.ieee.org/recipients/ieee-medal-of-honor-recipients/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Medal of Honor</a> for “a career of pioneering contributions to semiconductors, including the growth of semiconductor alloys and heterojunctions, and to visible light-emitting diodes and injection lasers.”\n</p><p>In honor of Holonyak, the IEEE Board of Directors established the IEEE Nick Holonyak, Jr. Medal for Semiconductor Optoelectronic Technologies in November 2021. The award will be presented for the first time at the annual IEEE Honors Ceremony in 2024. The medal is sponsored by Friends of Nick Holonyak, Jr. </p><h2>LED and other semiconductor industry breakthroughs</h2><p>\n\tAfter Holonyak earned bachelor’s, master’s, and doctoral degrees in electrical engineering from the University of Illinois, he was hired in 1954 as a researcher at <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Bell_Labs\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Bell Labs</a>, in Murray Hill, N.J. There he investigated silicon-based electronic devices.\n</p><p>\n\tHe left in 1955 to serve in the U.S. <a href=\"https://www.goarmy.com/careers-and-jobs/career-match/signal-intelligence/locations-stats-frequencies/25a-signal-officer.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Army Signal Corps</a>, and was stationed at Fort Monmouth, N.J., and Yokohama, Japan. After being discharged in 1957, he joined GE’s Advanced Semiconductor Laboratory, in Syracuse, N.Y.\n</p><p>\n\tWhile at the lab, he invented a <a href=\"https://patents.google.com/patent/EP0035841A2/en\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">shorted emitter thyristor device</a>. The four-layered semiconductor is now found in light dimmers and power tools. In 1962 he invented the red-light semiconductor laser, known as a <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Laser_diode\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">laser diode</a>, which now is found in cellphones as well as CD and DVD players.\n</p><p>\n\tLater that year, he demonstrated the first visible LED—a semiconductor source that emits light when current flows through it. LEDs previously had been made of gallium arsenide. He created crystals of gallium arsenide phosphide to make LEDs that would emit visible, red light. His work led to the development of the high-brightness, high-efficiency white LEDs that are found in a wide range of applications today, including smartphones, televisions, headlights, traffic signals, and aviation.\n</p><h2>Pioneering research at the University of Illinois</h2><p>\n\tHolonyak left GE in 1963 and joined the University of Illinois as a professor of electrical and computer engineering.\n</p><p>\n\tIn 1977 he and his doctoral students demonstrated the first <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Quantum_well_laser\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">quantum well laser</a>, which later found applications in fiber optics, CD and DVD players, and medical diagnostic tools.\n</p><p>\n\tThe university named him an <a href=\"https://ece.illinois.edu/about/directory/chairs/bardeen-chair\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">endowed-chair professor of electrical and computer engineering and physics</a> in 1993. The position was named for <a href=\"https://life.ieee.org/a-look-back-at-john-bardeen/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">John Bardeen</a>, an honorary IEEE member who had received two Nobel Prizes in Physics as well as the 1971 <a href=\"https://corporate-awards.ieee.org/recipients/ieee-medal-of-honor-recipients/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Medal of Honor</a>. Bardeen was Holonyak’s professor in graduate school. The two men collaborated on research projects until Bardeen’s death in 1991.\n</p><p>\n\t Together with IEEE Life Fellow <a href=\"https://ece.illinois.edu/about/directory/faculty/mfeng\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Milton Feng</a>, Holonyak led the university’s transistor laser research center, which was funded by the U.S. <a href=\"https://www.darpa.mil/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Defense Advanced Research Projects Agency</a>. There they developed <a href=\"https://news.illinois.edu/view/6367/498047\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">transistor lasers</a> that had both light and electric outputs. The innovation enabled high-speed communications technologies.\n</p><p>\n\tMore recently, Holonyak developed a technique to bend light within gallium arsenide chips, allowing them to transmit information by light rather than electricity.\n</p><p>\n\tHe supervised more than 60 graduate students, many of whom went on to become leaders in the electronics field.\n</p><h2>Queen Elizabeth prize, Draper prize, and other awards</h2><p>\n\tHolonyak received last year’s <a href=\"https://qeprize.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Queen Elizabeth Prize for Engineering</a>; the <a href=\"https://www.nae.edu/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">National Academy of Engineering’s</a> 2015 <a href=\"https://www.nae.edu/20681/DraperPrize\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Draper Prize</a>; the 2005 <a href=\"https://www.japanprize.jp/en/index.html\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Japan Prize</a>; and the 1989 <a href=\"https://corporate-awards.ieee.org/award/ieee-edison-medal/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">IEEE Edison Medal</a>. In 2008 he was inducted to the <a href=\"https://www.invent.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">National Inventors Hall of Fame</a>, in Akron, Ohio.\n</p><p>\n\tHe was a fellow of the <a href=\"https://www.amacad.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">American Academy of Arts and Sciences</a>, the <a href=\"https://www.aps.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">American Physical Society</a>, and <a href=\"https://www.optica.org/en-us/home/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Optica</a>. He was also a foreign member of the <a href=\"https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Russian_Academy_of_Sciences\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Russian Academy of Sciences</a>. In addition Holonyak was a member of the U.S. Academies of Engineering and <a href=\"http://www.nasonline.org/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Sciences</a>.\n</p><p>\n<em>Read the full story about Holonyak’s LED breakthrough in </em><a href=\"https://spectrum.ieee.org/red-hot\" target=\"_self\">IEEE Spectrum</a><em>. </em>\n</p><p><em><em>This article has been updated from an earlier version.</em></em></p>",
