  "description": "<p>Blind Mike's long journey to a better self begins today, as Kirk handles the show without his vision impaired sidekick. The Academy has issued new criteria for motion pictures to be eligible for the Oscars. The new rules are supposed to encourage \"inclusion,\" but Kirk can think of a few problems with a \"woke\" film industry (0:06:30). Kirk responds to Brandon Walker and Big Cat's Sirius XM segment with Trysta Krick regarding her column on Steve Nash's hiring (0:22:40). The staff of the Boston Globe are demanding justice from billionaire John Henry and his wife Linda because they need to pay off student loans (0:31:50). Ellie Schnitt, Kirk's once-adopted now-estranged daughter, has left Barstool Sports (0:57:40). A new documentary takes a look at Marty Walsh's Boston (1:35:00).</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
