  "description": "Relationships are hard, and it’s often because we defend ourselves against the very intimacy we seek by getting locked into problematic patterns of compulsive caretaking. Such was the topic of Mark Borg, Grant Brenner, and Daniel Berry’s first book, Irrelationship: How We Use Dysfunctional Relationships to Hide from Intimacy. These authors explain how to break out of such problematic patterns in their follow-up book, Relationship Sanity: Creating and Maintaining Healthy Relationships (Central Recovery Press, 2018). In our interview, Mark Borg and Daniel Berry break down how partners who have lost touch with each other can find themselves again and establish new, more authentic ways of connecting and being honest with one another. In their book as well as our discussion, they explain complex concepts in refreshingly plain language so that anyone can put their concepts into practice starting now. This interview will be of interest to those looking to improve their relationships and reconnect with their partners, as well as mental health professionals working with couples looking to find each other again.\nMark Borg, Jr. is a licensed psychologist and psychoanalyst in New York City who has developed theories and implementation strategies for community crisis intervention. His writings on community intervention, organizational consultation, and application of psychoanalytic theory to community crisis intervention have been published in various journals and collected work, and he has presented papers on his theories at academic conferences in the United States, Canada, Scotland, Ireland, Norway, Italy, Greece, Turkey, South Africa, Chile, and Israel.\nDaniel Berry is a Registered Nurse in New York City with background in inpatient, home care, and community settings. He currently serves as Assistant Director of Nursing for Risk Management at a public facility serving homeless and undocumented victims of street violence, addiction, and traumatic injuries. In 2015, he was invited to serve as a nurse consultant to a United Nations-certified NGO in Afghanistan promoting community development and addressing women’s and children’s health issues.\nEugenio Duarte, Ph.D. is a psychologist and psychoanalyst practicing in Miami.
