    "media:description": "Over the past three years, farmers across China have invested billions of dollars in huge, high-rise pig facilities.\n \nZhongxin Kaiwei Industrial Pig Farm, located in Ezhou City, Hubei Province, is equipped with many intelligent systems for automatic operation. The farm, dubbed the Pig's Palace, opened earlier this month with a capacity of 650,000 pigs. With two 26-story buildings, it is currently the tallest pig farm in the world.  When fully operational, the farm can process 100,000 tons of meat per year.\n-------------------\n#SpotlightOnChina  #China #ChinaInsights",
