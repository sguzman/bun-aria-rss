  "title": "Titans-Broncos, Steelers-Giants Recaps: Gostkowski melts down then wins it, Big Ben returns (Football 9/15)",
  "description": "Week 1 of the 2020 NFL season is in the books and like usual, we had some peculiar moments in the annual Monday Night Football doubleheader. Will Brinson is joined by Ryan Wilson and John Breech to break down the Titans 16-14 victory over the Broncos (3:00) and the Steelers 26-16 win over the Giants (23:00). A kicker was the story of the night, as Stephen Gostkowski continued Tennessee's kicking woes from last year, before nailing a game-winner late. Good thing we have kicking expert Breech to dissect. The coaching wasn't great. That we can agree on. But what should we make of the QB performances from Ryan Tannehill and Drew Lock? Then, the Pick Six Superfriends cover the first game which featured the return of Ben Roethlisberger. Big Ben looked rusty to start but came around for an encouraging outing. The Pittsburgh defense was beyond encouraging, as expected. They limited both Daniel Jones and Saquon Barkley in different ways and figure to be a force all year. After the break, Chris Long and Kyle Long join Brinson to recap some Week 1 action involving their former teams (40:30). \n\n'Pick Six' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Google Podcasts, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \nFollow the Pick Six team on Twitter: @picksixpod, @willbrinson, @ryanwilsonCBS, @johnbreech, @E_DeBerardinis\nVisit the Pick Six YouTube channel: https://www.youtube.com/picksix\nCheck out the Pick Six Instagram page https://www.instagram.com/picksixpod/?hl=en\nJoin our Facebook group https://www.facebook.com/groups/758548147935545/\nFor more NFL coverage from CBS Sports, visit https://www.cbssports.com/nfl/\nTo hear more from the CBS Sports Podcast Network, visit https://www.cbssports.com/podcasts/\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
