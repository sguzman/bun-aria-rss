  "description": "Emily Heiden was pregnant, panicked, and searching for advice. She found a clinic on the internet that promised medical guidance \"without politics or hype,\" yet what she encountered was not what she expected. California lawmakers, concerned about the way religious pregnancy centers marketed their services, later passed a law requiring them to include information about abortions. But the centers sued, arguing that the First Amendment protected them from having to advertise abortion services.\n\nThis week, we discuss whether a state can compel you to say something you disagree with on moral grounds -- from the perspective of the 2018 case NIFLA v Becerra.\n\nIf you love Unprecedented, you can support the show and more great podcasts from WAMU by heading to <a href=\"http://bit.ly/2PnT94H\">wamu.org/donate</a>",
