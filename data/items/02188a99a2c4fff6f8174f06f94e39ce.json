  "description": "<p>\"Do what you love,\" they say. But they don't tell you the other part-- that a lot of the time you spend doing what you love, you're doing stuff you don't love doing-- and that's normal! This heart-to-heart episode is all about how we ALL have to do things that aren't always fun and joyful to make our dreams come true. Being a conscious entrepreneur is #werk as we create this new paradigm and it's important we know that there WILL be road-blocks so we don't quit when they appear. I'm all about keeping it real with you guys and I think it's important we don't always glamorize the lives of entrepreneurs/ authors/ speakers/ influencers because EVERY job will have things that you don't always want to do. As creators, we must step-up to the plate and take each day by the horns because that's how we get stronger and help more people.</p> <p>Be part of a community that supports you discovering your dharma in Rose Gold Goddesses, the sacred sisterhood collective with community, content, creativity and so much more — learn more about rosegoldgoddesses.com.</p> <p>Write a review of the podcast and send a screenshot to sahara@eatfeelfresh.com to receive the FIRST HALF of my UNRELEASED book, Eat Right For Your Mind-Body Type FREE!</p> <p>Intro + Outro Music: Silent Ganges by Maneesh de Moor</p> <p>Discover your Dharma with my free quiz at https://iamsahararose.com/</p> <p>Connect with me for daily Ayurvedic and modern spiritual wisdom at: Instagram.com/iamsahararose<br /> Facebook.com/iamsahararose Twitter.com/iamsahararose</p> <p>Order My Books Eat Feel Fresh + Idiot's Guide to Ayurveda: https://www.iamsahararose.com/books</p> <p>By accessing this Podcast, I acknowledge that the entire contents are the property of Sahara Rose, or used by Sahara Rose with permission, and are protected under U.S. and international copyright and trademark laws.
