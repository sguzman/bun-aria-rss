  "description": "Why you absolutely should take the biggest peach you can find in the supermarket and sing to it. It might just hatch a baby! Unfortunately your fairy tale baby will do what fairy tale babies do: grow up and hear that call to adventure, going out to seek their fortune, taking no more than a plucky attitude and an angry dog to battle the evils of the world. The creature this time is Batman...if Batman was a literal bat who turned into an old man. — Sponsors: This episode is sponsored by Anchor.
