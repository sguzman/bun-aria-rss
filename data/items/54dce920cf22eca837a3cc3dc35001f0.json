  "description": "Ash brings us the story of Barbara Daly Baekeland, a New York socialite who ended up being murdered by her son Anthony “Tony” Baekeland. Barbara had a long history of mental illness and eventually her son did as well, some argue Tony’s mental illness began when his mother tried to “cure him of his homosexuality” by taking him to bed herself.
