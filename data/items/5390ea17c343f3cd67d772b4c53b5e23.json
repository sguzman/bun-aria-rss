  "description": "Nikki Glaser returns to the show because Marc finds her so easy to talk with, probably because they share so many similarities. They have kindred stand-up processes, they both get stressed out by writing, they have lifelong issues with food and eating, and they’re both still trying to figure out all that sex stuff. Marc and Nikki talk about all of that, as well as Nikki’s new HBO stand-up special, the places in the world they’re considering moving to, and whether it’s healthy to know anything about Pete Davidson and Kim Kardashian’s love life. <p>Sign up here for WTF+ to get the full show archives and weekly bonus material!  <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast\">https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast</a>.</p>\n\n<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
