  "description": "Despite the fact that Bitcoin has lost over 73% of its value since its all-time high in 2021, BTC bull and MicroStrategy co-founder and CEO Michael Saylor is unfazed.\n\n“I think that the next logical stop for Bitcoin is to replace gold as a non-sovereign store of value asset and gold is a $10 trillion asset as we speak. Bitcoin is digital gold, it’s 100x better than gold,” Saylor said during the Money Festival hosted by MarketWatch on Wednesday.\n\n“The half-life of money in crypto is forever. You can move it on billions of computers at the speed of light. So if Bitcoin goes to the value of the yellow metal, it’s going to $500,000 per coin, and I think that happens this decade,” Saylor pointed out.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
