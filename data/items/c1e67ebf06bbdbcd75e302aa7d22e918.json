  "description": "<p>Investing isn’t as simple as just throwing some money in the market and crossing your fingers. Yes, we do want you to invest. And yes there’s a chance you could probably invest more than you currently are. But there are a host of additional considerations that we want you examining before you open a brokerage account on your phone, initiating a transfer, and hitting purchase. Do you know what you’re investing in? Can you easily explain it to a friend? How do you feel about volatility, fees associated with that investment, illiquidity, and your time horizon? We like to think of it like taking a road trip- there are a number of things to do keep in mind like: do I know where I’m going, does my boss know I’m taking time off work, how long am I going to be gone, and can my car even handle a road trip of this magnitude? We’re not trying to dissuade you from investing, but we do want you to think twice before investing.</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we each enjoyed an Emergency Drinking Beer by Wild Heaven!
