  "description": "<div>Israel Keyes is the most terrifying serial killer you’ve maybe never heard of. <br>\n<br>\nHere’s what we know about him: He was methodical—he left “kill kits” hidden all across the country. He hid them years before using them, so he was also patient and self controlled. He picked his victims at random to avoid detection and is believed to have murdered at least 11 people across the United States between 2001 and 2012. He was a meticulous serial killer who constantly morphed his modus operandi and the location in which he killed which helped him evade capture for years. <br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>In this bone chilling documentary, we actually see him kidnap his final victim, and we watch him being arrested. We go into the interrogation room with him as the police and FBI try to get the names and locations of his victims. But it’s all a game to Keyes, and he’s only willing to divulge a few of his secrets. <br>\n<br>\n<strong>LOOKING FOR MORE TCO?
