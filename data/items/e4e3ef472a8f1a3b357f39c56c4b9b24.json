  "description": "<p>For the third and final episode in our Ecclesiastes series, Raechel and Amanda are joined by author, singer-songwriter, and friend of the SRT podcast, Kelly Minter. Chatting about everything from quarantine dogs to pink peonies, they wrestle with the book’s call to invest in this temporary life. What does it look like to find true meaning in God alone while also enjoying the gifts He gives us here “under the sun”? Kelly tells how one verse from Ecclesiastes changed her life, Raechel talks expiration dates, and Amanda tries out some new slang. And they all breathe a sigh of relief at Solomon’s hard-won conclusion. </p><p><b>Read with Us: </b></p><p>This episode corresponds to Week 3 of the She Reads Truth Ecclesiastes reading plan found on the <a href='http://t.ly/1JyqM'>She Reads Truth app</a> and <a href='https://shereadstruth.com/plans/'>SheReadsTruth.com</a>. </p><p>Shop the <a href='https://www.shopshereadstruth.com/collections/ecclesiastes'>Ecclesiastes</a> collection at <a href='http://t.ly/pxA07'>ShopSheReadsTruth.com</a>. </p><p>Save 25% on the Women & Men in the Word: New Testament collection with the code WORD25.</p><p>Show notes can be found at <a href='https://shereadstruth.com/podcast/ecclesiastes-week-3-with-kelly-minter/'>shereadstruth.com/podcast/ecclesiastes-week-3-with-kelly-minter/</a></p>",
