This is in large part because of the role insulin plays in cancer; insulin acts as a growth factor in the body, which is one of the reasons too much insulin leads to obesity. It’s also why insulin will support the growth of cancer cells.&nbsp;</p><br><p>In this compilation episode, Dr. Mark Hyman is joined by Dr. William Li and Dr. Jason Fung to discuss how recent research is now revealing the connection between insulin resistance and cancer, what you can eat to prevent cancer, and much more.</p><br><p>Dr. William Li is an internationally renowned physician, scientist and author of one of my favorite books, the New York Times bestseller Eat to Beat Disease: The New Science of How Your Body Can Heal Itself. His groundbreaking work has led to the development of more than 30 new medical treatments and impacted care for more than 70 diseases including cancer, diabetes, blindness, heart disease and obesity. His TED Talk, “Can We Eat to Starve Cancer?” has garnered more than 11 million views. Dr. Li has appeared on Good Morning America, CNN, CNBC, Live with Kelly & Ryan and the Dr. Oz Show, and he has been featured in USA Today, Time Magazine, The Atlantic, Parade and O Magazine. He is president and medical director of the Angiogenesis Foundation and is leading research into COVID-19.</p><br><p>Dr. Jason Fung is a physician, author, and researcher. His groundbreaking science-based books about diabetes and obesity, The Diabetes Code, The Obesity Code, and The Complete Guide to Fasting have sold over one million copies and challenged the conventional wisdom that diabetics should be treated with insulin. Dr. Fung is also the co-founder of The Fasting Method, a program to help people lose weight and reverse type 2 diabetes naturally with fasting.
