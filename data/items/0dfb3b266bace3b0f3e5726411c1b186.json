  "description": "<p>Ryan Whitney joins Kirk in-studio. Ryan admits he has never been more nervous for anything in his life than he is for this live show in Pittsburgh (00:10:00). Kirk is demanding that Dave hires a part-time producer to handle the show account in the next two weeks or he's fired (00:15:00). Riggs leaves Kirk Minihane off the invite list for this weeks two-day Barstool Classic (00:38:00). Kirk and Ryan are not on-board with a Rough n Rowdy Manningcast style broadcast (00:39:50). We're not sure why a shower that could fit the whole family is appealing but whatever sells real estate (01:05:00). Top Gun: Maverick, a few bad phone calls & more.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
