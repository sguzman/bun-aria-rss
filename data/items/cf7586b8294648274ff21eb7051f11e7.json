  "description": "<div>6 years ago, Aaron Quinn and Denise Huskins were woken in the middle of the night. It was a male voice who said, \"wake up, this is a robbery.\" They were both drugged and bound, and Denise was kidnapped and heled for 48 hours before being released. The ordeal was horrific, but even more terrifying: Nobody believed them. The cops insisted the whole thing was a hoax, even as the kidnapper made it clear that he was still out there, and could come back at any time. <br>\n<br>\n<strong>LOOKING FOR MORE TCO?</strong> On our <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/TrueCrimeObsessed\">Patreon feed</a>, you'll find over 200 FULL BONUS episodes to <strong>BINGE RIGHT NOW! </strong>Including our episode-by-episode coverage of <strong>\"LuLaRich\"</strong> <strong>\"John Wayne Gacy: Devil in Disguise\" </strong>\"<strong>Night Stalker</strong>\" <strong>\"The Jinx,\" \"Making A Murderer,\" \"The Staircase,\" </strong>\"<strong>I'll Be Gone in the Dark</strong>,\" \"<strong>A Wilderness of Error</strong>\" \"<strong>The Vow</strong>\"  \"<strong>Tiger King</strong>\" <strong>\"Don't F**K With Cats,\" \"The Menendez Murders,\" \"The Murder of Laci Peterson,\"</strong> <strong>\"Casey Anthony: American Murder Mystery,\"</strong> <strong>\"Serial,\" \"Lorena,\" \"The Disappearance of Madeleine McCann,\" \"OJ: Made in America\" </strong>and so many more! <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/TrueCrimeObsessed\">JOIN HERE!</a>  </div>\n",
