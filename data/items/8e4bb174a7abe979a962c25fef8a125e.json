  "description": "<p>Sam Kazemian is the founder of Frax, the fractional-algorithmic stablecoin protocol. After co-founding the decentralized Wikipedia startup Everipedia, Sam set out to pioneer the algorithmic stablecoin space. The FRAX stablecoin now has a market cap of over $2.6 billion, and the protocol’s FXS governance token is up 300% in the last year. </p> <p>In this episode, we explore the Stablecoin Wars, in which different protocols compete for liquidity and composability in DeFi. Sam brings a 1st-person perspective into the developments surrounding UST and the recently launched 4pool on Curve, which consists of stablecoins UST, FRAX, USDT, and USDC.</p> <p>A highlight of this conversation is Sam’s parable of an archetypal central bank, in which he cruises through a number of salient takes on money markets and macroeconomics. There is a lot to learn about this Cambrian explosion of financial technology, and Sam is a great teacher. Stick around to find out why walked away from this conversation bullish on Frax.</p> <p>------<br /> 📣 M·A·C: NFT | Keith Haring Collection for a Good Cause<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/MAC\">https://bankless.cc/MAC</a> </p> <p>------<br /> 🚀 SUBSCRIBE TO NEWSLETTER:          <a href= \"https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/\">https://newsletter.banklesshq.com/</a>  <br />  🎙️ SUBSCRIBE TO PODCAST:                 <a href= \"http://podcast.banklesshq.com/\">http://podcast.banklesshq.com/</a>  </p> <p>------<br /> BANKLESS SPONSOR TOOLS: </p> <p>⚖️ ARBITRUM | SCALED ETHEREUM<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum\">https://bankless.cc/Arbitrum</a> </p> <p>❎ ACROSS | BRIDGE TO LAYER 2<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Across\">https://bankless.cc/Across</a> </p> <p>🏦 ALTO IRA | TAX-FREE CRYPTO<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/AltoIRA\">https://bankless.cc/AltoIRA</a> </p> <p>👻 AAVE V3 | LEND & BORROW CRYPTO<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/aave\">https://bankless.cc/aave</a> </p> <p>⚡️ MAKER DAO | THE DAI STABLECOIN<br />  <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/MakerDAO\">https://bankless.cc/MakerDAO</a>  </p> <p>🦁 BRAVE | THE BROWSER NATIVE WALLET<br /> <a href= \"https://bankless.cc/Brave\">https://bankless.cc/Brave</a> </p> <p>------<br /> Topics Covered:</p> <p>0:00 Intro<br /> 3:30 Sam from Frax<br /> 7:50 The Stablecoin Narrative<br /> 13:45 The Central Bank Parable<br /> 24:45 Backing an Exchange Rate</p> <p>28:10 Frax Analytics | What is Frax?<br /> 37:34 Frax Analytics | The Peg<br /> 42:30 Frax Analytics | Comparing<br /> 45:03 RSA Gets Frax-Pilled</p> <p>49:42 MIM vs UST<br /> 53:16 The LUNA Token<br /> 56:41 Frax Roadmap | FPI</p> <p>1:04:36 The 4pool<br /> 1:14:00 The Stablecoin Wars<br /> 1:18:35 What Happens Next?<br /> 1:23:20 Closing & Disclaimers</p> <p>------<br /> Resources:</p> <p>Sam on Twitter<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/samkazemian\">https://twitter.com/samkazemian</a> </p> <p>Frax Finance<br /> <a href= \"https://app.frax.finance/\">https://app.frax.finance/</a> </p> <p>Decentralized Finance and the Debt Cycles<br /> <a href= \"https://academy.blue-swan.io/blog/decentralized-finance-and-the-debt-cycles\"> https://academy.blue-swan.io/blog/decentralized-finance-and-the-debt-cycles</a> </p> <p>Market Share Chart<br /> <a href= \"https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/decentralized-finance/stablecoins/total-crypto-backed-and-algorithmic-stablecoin-supply\"> https://www.theblockcrypto.com/data/decentralized-finance/stablecoins/total-crypto-backed-and-algorithmic-stablecoin-supply</a> </p> <p>Do Kwon’s 4pool Tweet<br /> <a href= \"https://twitter.com/stablekwon/status/1510021707377287170\">https://twitter.com/stablekwon/status/1510021707377287170</a> </p> <p>-----<br /> Not financial or tax advice.
