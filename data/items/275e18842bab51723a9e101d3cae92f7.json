  "description": "In the HBO Max film <em>Kimi, </em>Zoë Kravitz plays a woman with high anxiety and agoraphobia, who may or may not have observed a murder via a Siri-like voice assistant. Directed by Steven Soderbergh, the film is a tight, 90-minute surveillance thriller that takes its cues from some classics of the genre, including <em>Rear Window</em> and <em>The Conversation</em>. Yet it feels contemporary and fresh, particularly as it plays against the backdrop of the COVID-19 pandemic.",
