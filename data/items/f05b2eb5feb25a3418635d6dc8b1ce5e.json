  "title": "D.O.C. (Death of the Chorus) with Emily Warren",
  "description": "Listen to Top 40 pop over the last decade and you’ll notice something weird is happening. The chorus—the emotional apotheosis of a pop song, its dizzying high, its cathartic sing-along center—is disappearing. In its place, artists from Bad Bunny to Taylor Swift are toying with new, chorus-lite song forms that introduce a new musical grammar to the sound of contemporary pop. We may not think much about pop structure when listening to our favorite songs, but this is a big deal—the last time pop experienced such a seismic shift was when the chorus first came into fashion, back in the 1960s. What does this mean for modern musicians and listeners? Emily Warren, songwriter for new-guard stars like Dua Lipa and Khalid, joins to break down why the sea change in pop form represents a new horizon of creative possibility.\n\nSongs Discussed\nBad Bunny - Si Veo a Tu Mamá\nFuture & Drake - Life Is Good\nBillie Holiday - Blue Moon\nBeyonce - Formation\nTravis Scott - Sicko Mode\nQueen - Bohemian Rhapsody\nAretha Franklin - (You Make Me Feel Like) A Natural Woman\nDrake - Laugh Now Cry Later (ft.
