  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, this is the time where it's most dangerous to have an irresponsible media. All would be wise to tune out the disinformation from the Russia-hoax-media. In 2000, there was a rogue supreme court in Florida just as there is one now in Pennsylvania. One nuance, between the two, is that the Pennsylvania Supreme Court changed the State's voting laws right before the election. Then, the right to vote is protected in more than the initial allocation of the franchise. Equal protection applies as well to the manner of its exercise. Having once granted the right to vote on equal terms, the State may not, by later arbitrary and disparate treatment, value one person's vote over that of another. There must be at least some assurance that the rudimentary requirements of equal treatment and fundamental fairness are satisfied. What's more, the Governor of Pennsylvania and their supreme court made changes: 1. extending the receiving and counting of ballots beyond 8:00 PM on Election Day. 2, they eliminated the requirement for matching signatures. 3, they stopped requiring postal marks on the mailed-in ballots. The Pennsylvania Supreme Court violated Article II, Section II, Clause II of the federal Constitution acting as if they were the State's legislature. Later, just because the media doesn't agree with the presentation of Sidney Powell's case doesn't mean they have to destroy her or that RINO Republicans have to pile on. It may be difficult to win fairly because of judicial bias, but the case for fair elections must be made irrespective of the electoral outcome to ensure free and fair elections moving forward. Afterward, Fox News Host, Pete Hegseth, joins the program to discuss his new book \"Modern Warriors: Real Stories from Real Heroes.\" \nLearn more about your ad choices.
