  "description": "On Thursday’s Mark Levin show, Sen. Dick Durbin wrote a letter to the chairman of Sinclair Broadcasting, Group which is a private media organization, demanding information about its editorial policies. Can you imagine if a Republican wrote such a letter to CNN? It’s none of Durbin’s business what Sinclair does. The first amendment exists to stop tyrants like this. The only reason Durbin is going after Sinclair is because he can’t control it, like the Democrat Party control most of the media today. Also, it’s clear that Fox is out to get EPA administrator, Scott Pruitt, who is one of the most effective officials in the Trump administration. Did we know what lease Obama officials had or what dinners they had? No, the media didn’t want to know about it. Later, since Deputy Attorney General Rod Rosenstein won’t come on the show, we have some questions for him. Why does Rosenstein believe in a soviet style of justice? Why did Rosenstein expanded Robert Mueller’s investigation which had nothing to do with his original case? Why did Rosenstein extended the FISA court warrant knowing that the fusion GPS memo was funded by the DNC? Finally, all signs are bleak for the Republicans in the mid-term elections. The Republicans are losing because of the Republican Party. The Democrats care and nurture their base. The Republican party is a progressive party and hates its conservative base, especially Mitch McConnell. Paul Ryan and McConnell have delivered for the left what Barack Obama could not deliver.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
