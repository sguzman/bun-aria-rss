  "title": "Ep. 563 - BLM Riots Over Death Of Knife Wielding Maniac",
  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, riots have made their way to Amish country now. This time BLM and Antifa are tearing the city of Lancaster apart because a knife wielding maniac got shot while trying to stab a police officer to death. This, somehow, is racism we’re told. Also, two police officers in LA fall victim to an attempted assassination. How much responsibility do Joe Biden and the Democrats bear for this? And in our Daily Cancellation, I will be cancelling the “black national anthem” which was played before every NFL game this weekend.\nIf you like The Matt Walsh Show, become a member TODAY with promo code: WALSH and enjoy the exclusive benefits for 10% off at https://www.dailywire.com/walsh\nLearn more about your ad choices.
