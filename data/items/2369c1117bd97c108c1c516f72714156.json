  "description": "<p>This week, in Rutland, Vermont, a horribly murdered body is found, on fire, beneath the ski lift of a popular resort, and investigators have very little to work with. This isn't some tourist, either, this a full on small town twisted plot, that is as crazy as it is cruel. But the whole thing comes to a halt when something very basic comes into question... is the dead person actually who we thought it was? Or is that person actually the murderer?? This one is as wild as they get!</p><p> </p><p>Along the way, we find out that syrup runs downhill, that you should rely on more than a murder victim's uncle to identify them, and that if you see a friend, who you thought had been murdered... don't talk to them!!</p><p> </p><p>Hosted by James Pietragallo & Jimmie Whisman </p><p> </p><p>New episodes every Thursday! </p><p> </p><p>Donate at: patreon.com/crimeinsports or go to paypal.com & use our email: crimeinsports@gmail.com </p><p> </p><p>Go to shutupandgivememurder.com for all things Small Town Murder & Crime In Sports! </p><p> </p><p>Follow us on... </p><p> </p><p>twitter.com/@murdersmall </p><p> </p><p>facebook.com/smalltownpod </p><p> </p><p>instagram.com/smalltownmurder </p><p> </p><p>Also, check out James & Jimmie's other show, Crime In Sports!
