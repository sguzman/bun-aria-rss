  "description": "<p>Scott Soshnick, Eben Novy-Williams and Michael Barr discuss a host of issues related to the business of sports, including the possibility that Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson might play a mic’d up round of golf amid a total shutdown of sports programming. A fan on Twitter asked Mickelson about the possibility of playing a mic’d up round with Tiger Woods to give sports fans something to watch amid the Coronavirus shutdown. Mickelson responded with, “working on it.” The two did something similar in 2018, playing a round on pay-per-view with a $9 million purse on the line. Also talked about is New York Knicks and Rangers owner Jim Dolan’s decision to pay arena workers during the shutdown, joining the likes of Florida Panthers owner Vinnie Viola. Dolan has tested positive for the virus, MSG said, noting that he has developed few symptoms and is in self-isolation. And also discussed is how the NFL, NBA and Big 3 are going about returning to play.</p><p><br></p><p>Hosts: Scott Soshnick, Eben Novy-Williams and Michael Barr</p><p>Producer: Tim Herro</p><p><br></p><p>To contact the reporters on this story:</p><p>Scott Soshnick in New York at <a href=\"mailto:ssoshnick@bloomberg.net\">ssoshnick@bloomberg.net</a>;</p><p>Eben Novy-Williams in New York at <a href=\"mailto:enovywilliam@bloomberg.net\">enovywilliam@bloomberg.net</a>;</p><p>Michael Barr in New York at <a href=\"mailto:mbarr18@bloomberg.net\">mbarr18@bloomberg.net</a></p><p><br></p><p>To contact the editor responsible for this story:</p><p>Scott Soshnick at <a href=\"mailto:ssoshnick@bloomberg.net\">ssoshnick@bloomberg.net</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
