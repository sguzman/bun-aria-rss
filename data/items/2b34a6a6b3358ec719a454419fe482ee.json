Whatever that pain looks like for you, I believe we must lean into the pain every day.” [18:36]   “It's not enough to do the work in the past. It's a continual process in the present. That makes me feel at peace every day.” [24:19]   “Love is not enough for a long term committed, healthy relationship to fully work.” [29:28]   “I'm willing to grow and improve but I'm not going to just do something to create peace.” [39:51]   “The ability to have a beginner's mind, find and surround myself by great coaches, and be unapologetic in asking for feedback. Feedback has been a huge indicator of my success.” [43:55]   “Just because someone's giving you feedback doesn't mean it's true about you. So, don't take it personally. And see where is the truth in there, and how can you apply it” [45:16]   Follow Lewis Howes: Website: <a href=\"https://lewishowes.com\" rel=\"noopener\">https://lewishowes.com</a>/  YouTube: <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/lewishowes\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.youtube.com/c/lewishowes</a>/about  Twitter: <a href=\"https://twitter.com\" rel=\"noopener\">https://twitter.com</a>/LewisHowes  Instagram: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/lewishowes/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/lewishowes/</a>",
