  "description": "<p>ENERGY FLOWS TO AND THROUGH YOU. We tend to minimize what we think we can accomplish. We put ourselves in a box. But we often think that other people can do what we can’t. Why do we believe in others more than ourselves? We all have infinite potential. But we let our “paradigm” define what’s possible. Let’s investigate all the ways your thoughts are holding you back from being happy, healthy, and wealthy. On today’s episode of The School of Greatness, I talk about shifting your paradigms with a master of the Law of Attraction: Bob Proctor. Bob Proctor is one of the most sought-after speakers in the world and featured in the wildly popular film, The Secret.

He is the best-selling author of \"You Were Born Rich\" and has transformed the lives of millions through his books, seminars, courses and personal coaching. Bob says he was going nowhere before he “woke up” to how the universe works. He’s passionate because he figures that if it could work for him, it could work for anyone.
