Dry Farms is an online wine subscription that pairs organic, biodynamic, naturally yeasted, low-sugar, lower-alcohol wines from all over the world. As Dry Farm customers, we get to share in their love for organic, naturally and traditionally made wines. We love them because their wine is delicious - it challenges and explores your wine palette in all the right ways - and their wine makes you feel good! As with all things, “better, not more.” <br/>Angela was sipping an Austrian Blaufränkisch from the Carnuntum region.   A 2018 natural wine sourced from Dry Farm.   Let this wine age for TEN YEARS for maximum fabulousness.   This is a red bled of grapes from on sand, clay and slate.  Each 15 km apart.   Cool flavors and minerally.   Just the way we like it and we know YOU will to.   Give a Dry Farm subscription a try today!<br/><b><br/>Today’s episode is brought to you by: <br/>Jovial Foods. </b>Jovial Foods is a company that supplies us homemakers with the most gorgeous baking flours and foods.
