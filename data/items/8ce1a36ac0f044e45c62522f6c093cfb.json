  "description": "<p>It’s no secret.  The vast majority of the world considers us homesteaders to be a bit of an odd bunch.  If we’re being honest with ourselves, what we do on a daily basis is certainly abnormal in modern society.  Even my non-homesteading friends have a major misconception when it comes to why we actually do what we do.  I must admit, it certainly would be much easier to go to the store and buy a gallon of milk than it is to own your own milk cow.  It would also be much easier to grab a cheap loaf of bread than make fresh sourdough from scratch.  If we’ve learned anything over the years, easier is not always better and it’s a concept that some people will never understand.  Tune in today to see why shoveling manure is cathartic, why dirt under my nails is a badge of honor, and why the best time to mow the lawn is when you’re mad. </p><p>>> A BIG shout-out to our podcast sponsor this month— Lehman’s Hardware! <a href='https://bit.ly/PH-lehmans'>https://bit.ly/PH-lehmans</a></p><p>They are your one-stop homesteading shop for EVERYTHING you need for an old-fashioned lifestyle.
