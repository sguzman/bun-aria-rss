  "description": "<p>Howard Schweber, a professor at the University of Wisconsin School of Law, discusses a proposal by the Trump administration, which seeks to restrict protests by blocking demonstrations along the north sidewalk of the White House and making it easier for police to shut them down. The proposal, which originated from the National Park Service, could also open to door to charging protestors for the cost of putting up barricades or re-seeding grass. Plus, Adam Smith, a partner at Gibson Dunn, discusses the potential for new U.S. sanctions against Saudi Arabia in the wake of the disappearance of journalist Jamal Khashoggi in Istanbul.
