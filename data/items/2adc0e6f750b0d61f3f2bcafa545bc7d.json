  "description": "Last week we revealed that 14th Circuit Judge Carmen Mullen — who has been a key figure in the Murdaugh world — tried to create a crime and orchestrate the arrest of a man with psychiatric vulnerabilities in her neighborhood five years ago. This week, we have the recordings showing what she did — and her behavior is far worse than it sounded on paper. Once again, Mandy and Liz take on the judicial system and call on the state Supreme Court to stop looking the other way on judicial misconduct. \nI don’t know how many more disturbing stories the justices on the Supreme Court of South Carolina need to hear about Judge Carmen Mullen or how many more times her integrity needs to be publicly questioned before they pull their heads out of the sand and take action.\n\nStay tuned for a bonus episode of Cup of Justice this week as we peer deeper into this mess and the circus of a hearing last Thursday.\n\nSUNscribe to our free email list to get alerts on bonus episodes, calls to action, new shows and updates.
