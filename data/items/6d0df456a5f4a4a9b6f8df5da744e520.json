After which, Bianca chats with Emily Henry, author of <em>Beach Read</em> and <em>People We Meet on Vacation</em>, about focusing on tension rather than plot; keeping yourself and your readers guessing; backstory being why front story matters; starting with misdirection; and not giving your characters too much self awareness. </p>",
