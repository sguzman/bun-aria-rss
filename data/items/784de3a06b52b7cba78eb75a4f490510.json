  "description": "How are we supposed to concentrate on nuclear weapons dramas in the Middle East and the Koreas, new U.S. special forces deployments, Bibi Netanyahu doing his best Gallagher prop-comedy impression and all the other lunacy going on in the world with all the even more distracting lunacy going on in Washington?  Can a strong mastery of acronyms help?  Or is beer a better choice?  Ploughshares Fund’s Joe Cirincione, Rosa Brooks of Georgetown University Law School and David Rothkopf go a little off the rails trying to figure out how to cope.  The best answer they came up with is to look at the whole Trump presidency as a historical belch. (Look away and pretend it didn’t happen.)
