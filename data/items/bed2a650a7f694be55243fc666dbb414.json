  "description": "<p>Subscribe, rate, and leave a review.\n\nWe kick off the show talking about Drew Brees' comments on kneeling during the national anthem. Feits' explains why sports are the exact opposite of an \"escape from the world.\" We talk about how the earth \"cries meteor\" way too often. AITA Thursday returns with blowing on tan, dressing up for funerals, penis enlargement surgery, and an uptight loser. Voicemails include accents, baths vs brushing teeth, cute lil tummy, and giving a hand. \n\nBill Burr returns to the show. We discuss how he's doing in quarantine, his upcoming movie (highly recommend) The King of Staten Island, meeting Pete Davidson before he was just getting started, the impact The Last Dance had on him, and much more.\n\nThe King of Staten Island and F is For Family out on June 12th.\n\nLet us know what you think on twitter. \n@kfcradio @KFCBarstool @feitsbarstool @billburr\n\nCheck out clips of the podcast on our Youtube Channel.
