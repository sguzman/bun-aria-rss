Brandon dives into what inspires him and reveals his why and purpose while elaborating on the future of House of Athlete and the I Am Athlete Podcast.\n\nStarting out Omar and Brandon discuss the challenges of navigating work/life balance. Brandon shares how he and his wife Michi Marshall work together to manage family while they both succeed on the business front. \n\nWith Brandon becoming a huge advocate for the mental health community, Omar asks him if the result of him going public with his diagnoses of borderline personality disorder produced the outcome he had expected. Brandon goes on to explain that by going public with his diagnoses in 2009, it allowed him to discover his purpose in life. Brandon shares that people lives have been saved solely on his decisions to go public with his struggles and since that day he has vowed to make it his life’s purpose to remove the stigma of mental health and take mental health from a taboo conversation to an everyday conversation.\n\nAfter a success NFL Career Brandon shares how he navigated his way into the broadcasting arena and what tools he took from that experience into his personal business ventures. \nHe takes us back to when he played for the Chicago Bears and shares a story of him attempting to negotiate his own NFL contract in order to gain knowledge and experience on the business end within the NFL. This experience would lead to him wanting to learn more and would ultimately play a huge role in Brandon’s post NFL career in business.  \n\nOmar turns the table to business after asking Brandon what his vision was for House of Athlete, and the I Am Athlete Podcast. Brandon shares that he had always wanted to run his own nonprofit to benefit the mental health community and he planned to use House of Athlete and I am Athlete’s to do so. Brandon shares the story of how the pandemic in 2020 helped birth the I Am Athlete Podcast with Channing Crowder, Fred Taylor and Reggie Wayne and then later with Chad Johnson. After launching Season 3 of IAA, Omar asks the burning question of where the future of I am Athlete is headed. Brandon responds that the IAA Miami is a cultural phenomenon, and it cannot be duplicated and moving forward he will improve on listening and catering to his audience when it comes to content.\n\nI AM ATHLETE:\nOfficial Site: https://iamathletetv.com/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/iamathlete\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/iamathletepodcast/\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/IAMATHLETEpod\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@iamathlete_podcast?\n\nHOUSE OF ATHLETE:\nOfficial Site: https://houseofathlete.com/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/thehouseofathlete/?utm_medium=copy_link\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/houseofathlete\nApparel Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/houseofathleteapparel/?utm_medium=copy_link\nHoA Supplements on Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/houseofathlete\n\n#IAMATHLETE\n#BrandonMarshall\n#ChadJohnson\n#ChanningCrowder\n#MoreThanAPodcast\n\nDRAFTKINGS\nIf you or someone you know has a gambling problem, crisis counseling and referral services can be accessed by calling 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537) (IL).\n\nGambling problem?
