  "description": "<p><p>Ice Cube on kicking guys out of the Big 3, what it's like being a visionary, how he almost invented Netflix, comparisons to Kanye, when the Internet tried to figure out what day It Was A Good Day was, and why Google thinks Dr Dre is dead (he's not). Ashley & Rayna from Girls Gotta Eat stop by to talk about the hot guys on Stranger Things, how Cancers are the Patriots of astrology, whether Jason Momoa has a dad bod, how many girls should a guy have sex with, what is the perfect penis size, and why cults are such a turn on. KFC & Feits recap the live show, Abella Danger's ATI is blowing up, football coaches at the pool. Voicemails include: what's your anamorph, annoying evolution, do the homeless have sex, and embarrassingly late.</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
