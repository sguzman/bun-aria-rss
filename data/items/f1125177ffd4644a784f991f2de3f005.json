  "description": "Is coronavirus a pandemic or a Dem panic? Should we lather ourselves in hand sanitizer to keep Kung Flu away, or is the left-wing media blowing the Wuhan virus out of proportion? We will examine the facts as well as other funny names for the public health crisis. Then, Kamala Harris endorses a man she considers a vile racist, Hillary Clinton refuses to endorse anybody, and MSNBC’s Brian Williams teams up with New York Times editorial board members Mara Gay to fail at basic arithmetic.\n\nCheck out The Cold War: What We Saw, a new podcast written and presented by Bill Whittle at https://www.dailywire.com/coldwar. In Part 1 we peel back the layers of mystery cloaking the Terror state run by the Kremlin, and watch as America takes its first small steps onto the stage of world leadership.\n\nIf you like The Michael Knowles Show, become a member TODAY with promo code: KNOWLES and enjoy the exclusive benefits for 10% off at https://www.dailywire.com/Knowles\nLearn more about your ad choices.
