An early access game that went from bad to worse and then even worse. Starforge was created by a company called CodeHatch, well known for creating and then abandoning games such as Reign of Kings and Heat. \n\nStarforge was so bad that they had to remove it from Steam entirely. Games by CodeHatch have been considered scams ever since. If you look into the history of CodeHatch then you'll know why Starforge failed along with reign of kings and Heat.",
