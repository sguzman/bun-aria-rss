  "description": "Most of Deep State Radio’s cutting edge, youthful listeners are probably too young to remember the song the title references (“Mrs. Brown You Had a Lovely Daughter” by Herman’s Hermits).  But so were all of us at Deep State Radio.  We’re just very well educated.  No, seriously.  Except David. Who actually remembers it.  Poor old guy.  Anyway…the title refers to Donald Trump’s New-Improved-Yuge-Better-Than-Ever NAFTA which he has rebranded the USMCA (pronounced Us-Muck-Uh.)  But what it really is the old NAFTA with a new paint job.  Still, it’s better than a sharp stick in the eye (or the collapse of the old NAFTA). The only question is what does it mean for the future of US trade policy—especially with China and the EU.  Our panelists including the Financial Times’ Ed Luce, IISS’ Kori Schake, Georgetown University’s Rosa Brooks and the Atlantic Council’s Evelyn Farkas discuss.
