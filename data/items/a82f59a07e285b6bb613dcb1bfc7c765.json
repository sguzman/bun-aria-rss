  "description": "Glenn sits down with both James A. Lindsay, an author, and mathematician as well as Peter Boghossian, an assistant professor of Philosophy at Portland State University. These two men along with their associate Helen Pluckrose spent 10 months writing 20 hoax papers that illustrated and parodied what they call \"grievance studies\" and submitted them to \"the best journals in the relevant fields.\" Out of these 20 papers, seven of them were accepted, four were published online, and three were being processed. Being dubbed as \"Sokal Squared\", this hoax has been applauded by several scholars for unmasking what they called academe's leftist, victim-obsessed ideological slant and low publishing standards. If you're worried about the state of culture in this country, if you're curious of the inner workings of the world of academia, and you're fed up with the increasing authoritarian ideology from the left or from the right, this podcast is for you. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
