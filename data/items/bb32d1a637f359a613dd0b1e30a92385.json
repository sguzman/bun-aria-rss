  "description": "Sermon on the Mount: Part 9. Matthew 5:43-48. Love Your Enemies. This is the last piece, of the first section of the Sermon on the Mount. Here, Jesus challenges the laws of reciprocity we’ve seen in the past few weeks, highlighting the embodied faith of the Kingdom. What levitical laws does Jesus confront? How does he expand the Jewish understanding of who was a neighbor? What is the understanding of an enemy? How are we to interact with those who oppose us? What does it mean to love your enemies? We have landed at a pivotal section of the Sermon on the Mount.\n\nAs always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
