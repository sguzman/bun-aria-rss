  "description": "<p>Globular Clusters (GCs) provide valuable insight into the properties of their\nhost galaxies' dark matter halos. Using N-body simulations incorporating\nsemianalytic dynamical friction and GC-GC merger prescriptions, we study the\nevolution of GC radial distributions and mass functions in cuspy and cored dark\nmatter halos. Modeling the dynamics of the GC-rich system in the dwarf galaxy\nUGC7369, we find that friction-induced inspiral and subsequent mergers of\nmassive GCs can naturally and robustly explain the mass segregation of the GCs\nand the existence of a nuclear star cluster (NSC). However, the multiple\nmergers required to form the NSC only take place when the dark matter halo is\ncuspy. In a cored halo, stalling of the dynamical friction within the core\nhalts the inspiral of the GCs, and so the GC merger rate falls significantly,\nprecluding the formation of an NSC. We therefore argue that the presence of an\nNSC requires a cusp in UGC7369. More generally, we propose that the presence of\nan NSC and the corresponding alteration of the GC mass function due to mergers\nmay be used as an indicator of a cuspy halo for galaxies in which we expect NSC\nformation to be merger-dominated. These observables represent a simple,\npowerful complement to other inner halo density profile constraint techniques,\nand should allow for straightforward extension to larger samples.\n</p>",
