    "media:description": "Finally, it is here! The VHS Mini Series part 3. In a large spurt of adrenaline and lack of shame I wrote and produced this in 2 days. Is it a masterpiece? No. Is the audio quality tolerable? Absolutely not, but that doesnâ€™t mean you have to let me know about it in the comments. Also, check your clocks boys you got three more days till you can say anything you want down there.",
