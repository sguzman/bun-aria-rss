  "description": "“Don’t confuse a brand you know for a company you should own...” - Mike Alkin Welcome back to another episode of Wall Street Unplugged. This week’s guest is Mike Alkin – Curzio Research’s newest Senior Analyst and Editor of—I can finally say it—Moneyflow Trader. On today’s show, you asked — we answer. Mike and I go over the questions you posted we didn’t get to answer on this week’s video training series… while giving you a hefty sneak peek at what’s ahead for Moneyflow Trader. Topics and questions covered on the show include:  Mike’s bearish and bullish sectors of 2018 A mini masterclass on how to think about risk… both from a macro perspective, and for each individual position you hold. The art of the exit, and the age-old question of when to sell And the very personal reasons Mike left the hedge fund world to start a newsletter for \"little guy\" investors like us...  As we approach a tipping point in today’s eight-year bull market, don’t miss out on what this hedge-fund vet has to say about the so-called S&P 500 and 401k “safe” plays. You heard it here first. Good investing, Frank Curzio",
