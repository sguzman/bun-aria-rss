  "description": "On today’s show, Pat and the boys chat about Philip Rivers deciding to retire and whether or not he’s a Hall of Famer. They also discuss Patrick Mahomes’ status for Sunday’s game against the Bills as it looks like he’s on pace to be able to play, and look more at both matchups for Conference Championship weekend. Joining the program is 2x Pro Bowler, FB for the Baltimore Ravens, Patrick Ricard. Pat and Patrick chat about his conversion from a defensive lineman at Maine to FB once he got to Baltimore, him doing an Oklahoma drill on every play, what happened with the Ravens during their midseason struggles, and his mentality as a Fullback in the NFL (47:35-1:12:39). Next, 3x Pro Bowler, friend of the show, co-host of Bussin' With The Boys, Tackle for the Tennessee Titans, Taylor Lewan joins the program to discuss his rehab from a torn ACL, being in the concussion protocol, why Michigan Football extended Jim Harbaugh, his thoughts on the Ravens/Titans feud and why he loves being petty, and much more (1:12:41-1:36:13). Later, Pat and AJ discuss the Hall of Fame and why it's such a ridiculous discussion, and look back at AJ's previous run-in with Motor City Dan Campbell, the new Head Coach of the Detroit Lions (1:38:13-1:57:30).
