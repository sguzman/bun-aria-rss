  "description": "<p>Xavier Himma met me on the roof of my apartment to tell me about his amazing bike ride from Ottawa to Argentina. I've never even heard of such a thing. Be aware that the first 3 minutes of the interview the sound goes a little down and up but then it evens out for the remainder. Regardless, it was such an interesting conversation and an amazing adventure to hear about. It makes me want to get out into the world again.</p> <p>Check out Xavier's Vlog on YouTube at YouTube.com/HumOfTheEarth where he shows video of all the crazy places he's been on that damn bike.</p> <p>The new Skeptic Tank Patreon is up at: https://www.patreon.com/skeptictank</p>",
