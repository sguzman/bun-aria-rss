  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, the Democrats are a criminal's best friend. Looking at what they've done with our streets, with our border, and our government. Homeland Security Secretary Alejandro Mayorkas lies about the border security of this country in order to do the dirty work of Biden's Officials Susan Rice, and Ron Klain. They didn't hesitate to conjure up a narrative about racism back when border agents were charged with whipping Haitian immigrants, but the photographer (an eyewitness) has revealed that Mayorkas knew the photos were being taken out of context hours before making his initial statements and spreading Biden's big lie anyway. This was proved today by emails obtained by a Freedom Of Information Act request. Then, another bombshell revealed in open court in today's Danchenko trial was that the senior FBI officials traveled overseas to offer ex-spy Christopher Steele $1 million for the dossier that they knew was fake. Special Counsel Durham personally walked jurors through this phony information which was used by the FBI to obtain a FISA warrant to conduct surveillance on Trump and his campaign. The dossier was initially paid for by Hillary Clinton's campaign and the Democrat National Committee through a law firm they hired for opposition research. The Democrats within the FBI and the media are the real insurrectionists. Later, the convention of states must be grasped and enacted. Isaiah Berlin's thoughts on liberty are staples that must not be forgotten. Berlin's concept of positive and negative liberty is that negative liberty is the absence of obstacles, barriers, or constraints. Positive liberty is the possibility of acting — or the fact of acting — in such a way as to take control of one's life and realize one's fundamental purposes. Afterward, Don Bolduc from New Hampshire joins the show to discuss his campaign for the US Senate. Bolduc says that his opponent has outspent him by $23 million thus far spreading lies to smear his campaign.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
