  "title": "Learning Methods for Dialog Workshop at NIPS This Saturday",
  "content": "The <a href=\"http://letsdiscussnips2016.weebly.com/schedule.html\">schedule for the workshop</a> has been finalized, and I'm pretty excited.  We managed to convince some seasoned researchers in dialog, who don't normally attend NIPS, to give invited talks.  We're also devoting some time to &ldquo;Building Complete Systems&rdquo;, because it's easy to focus on the trees instead of the forest, especially when the tree is something really interesting like a neural network trained on a bunch of GPUs.  But don't worry, there's plenty of &ldquo;NIPS red meat&rdquo; in the schedule as well.<br /><br />See you on Saturday!",
