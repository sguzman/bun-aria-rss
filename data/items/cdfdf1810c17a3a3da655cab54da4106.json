  "description": "<p>Barry and Honey Sherman /// Part 1 /// 210</p>\n<p>Part 1 of 2</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><a href=\"http://www.TrueCrimeGarage.com\">www.TrueCrimeGarage.com</a>Barry and Honey Sherman were one of the wealthiest couples in Canada. Barry had founded a large pharmaceutical business in his younger years that was wildly successful. With the success came many friends and enemies. In December of 2017 both Barry and Honey were found dead in their mansion. It’s very likely that the two were dead for more than 24 hours before the discovery of their bodies. Early indicators suggest strongly that the Toronto Police Service suspected a murder/suicide. That Barry had killed his wife and them himself. As the Investigation continued we would find that there are reasons to suspect that the rich couple were murdered in their home. This week we venture back to Canada and see if we can shed some light on the unfolding story of the deaths of Barry and Honey Sherman.
