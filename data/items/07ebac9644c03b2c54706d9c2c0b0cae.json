  "description": "<p>Originally from Denmark where he grew up as the son of a chef and hotelier in the happiest country in the world, <a href= \"https://www.leosteenwines.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Leo Hansen</a> started in the hospitality world at the ripe old age of 12 and hasn’t stopped since.</p> <p>First he was a certified European sommelier working for a Michelin starred restaurant and that brought him to the US where he immersed himself in the world of New World winemaking. In 2004 he started <a href=\"https://www.leosteenwines.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Leo Steen Wines</a>, which concentrates on divine Chenin Blanc (AKA Steen in South Africa, but ironically a family name as well!) but also makes Cab Franc, Chardonnay, and Grenache.</p> <p>He has been in California for 20 years but he maintains a European palate and focuses on traditional European winemaking techniques like foot treading, natural yeasts, lower alcohols and less new oak. He’s the perfect balance of professional winemaker and sommelier and a fascinating guy all around.</p> <p> </p> <p>And a few show notes:</p> <ul> <li>Leo tells us about his early life as a the son of a chef and hotelier, including some notes about Danish cuisine!</li> <li>We learn about Leo\\'s career path, especially his time at <a href= \"https://www.viamichelin.com/web/Restaurant/KOBENHAVN-1070_K-Kong_Hans_Kaelder-2unmura\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Kong Hans</a> in Copenhagen, a Michelin Starred Restaurant</li> <li>We discuss the difference in sommelier culture in Denmark v. the US</li> <li>Leo takes us through his journey from a harvest worker at Clos du Bois to owner of <a href=\"https://www.leosteenwines.com\" target= \"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Leo Steen</a>. </li> <li>Finally, we discuss his specific philosophies and wines and why site is so important to his wine.</li> </ul> <p>For more info on Underground Wine Events, go to <a href= \"http://www.undergroundwineevents.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">www.undergroundwineevents.com</a></p> <p> </p> <p><strong>Thanks to our sponsors this week: <a href= \"https://www.patreon.com/winefornormalpeople\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\"><img style=\"float: right;\" src= \"https://assets.libsyn.com/secure/show/45638/width_100_patreon_icon.jpg\" alt=\"\" width=\"75\" height=\"75\" /></a></strong></p> <p><strong>YOU!</strong>The podcast supporters on Patreon, who are helping us to make the podcast possible and who we give goodies<br /> in return for their help!
