  "description": "<p>Introducing the Band:<br />Your hosts Scot Bertram (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/ScotBertram\" target=\"_blank\">@ScotBertram</a>) and Jeff Blehar (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/EsotericCD\" target=\"_blank\">@EsotericCD</a>) are joined by our old friend Charles C. W. Cooke. Charlie is a Senior Writer for <i>National Review, </i>and you can find his work wherever quality Charles C. W. Cooke products are sold (i.e. mostly right <a href=\"https://charlescwcooke.com/\">here</a> on this website). Follow him on Twitter at <a href=\"https://twitter.com/charlescwcooke\" target=\"_blank\">@charlescwcooke</a>.<br /><br />Charlie's Music Pick: Fleetwood Mac<br />\"Oh sure,\" you think as you read what artist we're covering this week, \"I know them. Everybody knows them.\" Well yes . . . and no. You know the hits (everyone does -- new generations of teens have been \"rediscovering\" <i>Rumours</i> since the early 1980s at least), but what you might not know about is the sheer artistic drive of this, the latter-era version of Fleetwood Mac. That force came from the addition of none other than guitarist/vocalist/songwriter Lindsey Buckingham and vocalist/songwriter Stevie Nicks. Buckingham and Nicks were also a long-time romantic pair just then slowly beginning to come apart at the seams when they joined Fleetwood Mac, a fact that would have certain consequences for their music and their career.  <br /> </p><p>Even though the story only covers a handful of albums, the journey is vast. From the 1975 self-titled album (a fitting title for a true rebirth of the band) to the world-dominating pop-rock perfection of <i>Rumours</i> to the willful obscurantism of <i>Tusk</i> and the retrenchment from <i>Mirage</i> and onwards, the Buckingham/Nicks-era Fleetwood Mac is populated with landmarks of modern music, and attests not only to the restless studio genius (and technical perfection as a guitarist) of Lindsey Buckingham but of an entire group. They were a three-headed songwriting behemoth backed by the finest and most organically creative rhythm section in all of popular music. The soap opera is the stuff you probably already knew -- though you might not have known the Stevie Nicks cocaine factoid Jeff lays on the audience during the show -- so come and stay for an appreciation of the greatness of this music. We'll save you a place.</p>\n",
