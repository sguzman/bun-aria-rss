  "description": "<p>How do you use psychology persuasion techniques to get people to contribute to your cause?  That's what I discuss in this episode of The Psych Files.  I'm trying to help my friend raise money and in doing so I employed a number of persuasion strategies to get people to help him out and I'm sure these ideas will be helpful to you as well.  We'll look at how Cialdini's ideas can be applied to fundraising and we'll look at other topics you may have studied in a psychology class: goal setting, bystander apathy, and the need to generate excitement in order to persuade people to part with their money.  I'll also look at the ethics of all this.  Is it okay to use these strategies on people?  When is it not okay?  Hopefully an interesting an useful episode up ahead.   </p>",
