Catering for the Madawaska trip is now in jeopardy after Big Rick sent Justin a sad text message, and he needs to reach out and apologize to get back in the good graces of Kirk. Selectman Dan Daigle is not willing to compromise his morals to stay on the Madawaska board and Kirk changes his mind on how he feels about him. Kirk denies a baptism and gives his thoughts on Jon Rahm withdrawing from the Memorial Tournament.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
