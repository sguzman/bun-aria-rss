That‚Äôs exactly what we‚Äôre going to talk about this week, and you‚Äôre going to be SURPRISED at what you‚Äôre about to hear. Let‚Äôs start with a basic TRUTH. THE WORLD IS MOVING FASTER THAN EVER. Most of us get caught up in day-to-day living at WARP SPEED just trying to keep up with everyone else. It's one thing to be AMBITIOUS and lead a FULL LIFE, but quite another to do so at the expense of your HEALTH. Unfortunately, a lot of people are doing just that. INCLUDING ME! It‚Äôs no secret, and I‚Äôve shared with you recently that I‚Äôve been going through some health issues. That‚Äôs why today‚Äôs episode is particularly meaningful for me. It‚Äôs time to talk about the importance of SELF-CARE, PERSONAL HEALTH, and WELLNESS. And my guest, JASON TEBEAU, is going to reveal some fascinating approaches to these topics that you‚Äôve probably never heard before. Jason is the CEO of Da Vinci Medical and creator of the SUPERHUMAN PROTOCOL. He and his brilliant team have developed GROUNDBREAKING solutions that are helping people HEAL by attacking the root causes of many kinds of ailments. The Superhuman Protocol combines what we know about our bodies and the NATURAL ENERGIES OF EARTH, WIND, AND FIRE, and combines those things with state-of-the-art SCIENTIFIC WELLNESS PRACTICES including pulsed-electromagnetic therapy, exercise with oxygen therapy, and photobiomodulation. You‚Äôll want to hear what Jason has to say about body MAGNETISM, EARTHING, and the importance of making sure you have enough SUNLIGHT in your life. Connecting with each of these things is critical for OPTIMAL health. And, all are backed by PEER-REVIEWED scientific studies. Jason does a great job of breaking these things down into bite-size bits of information, along with PRACTICAL TIPS you can use to fire up your immune system and your overall health. In fact, one of those is as simple as taking time to walk around BAREFOOT, put your feet into some grass and earth, and directly connect with MOTHER EARTH. You‚Äôll also learn why it‚Äôs important for you to stop DRINKING WATER two hours before you go to bed. We even talk about something as basic as how to BREATHE the right way, including how proper breathing can actually help cure a hangover. Jason has a lot more to say about changes you can make right now that will have you feeling better almost immediately. Let me be clear‚Ä¶I‚Äôm not here to push a product or service on you.
