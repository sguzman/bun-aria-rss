  "description": "Every week it seems that more and more evidence of Donald Trump's attempts at election subversion are revealed but where is the Department of Justice in their investigations.  With some of the crimes outlined in the Mueller Report reaching their statute of limitations, swift action is necessary to preserve our democracy.  At this pivotal moment, DSR host David Rothkopf and co-host Kavita Patel talk with Richard Painter, former ethics lawyer in the George W. Bush administration, and Randall Eliason, former AUSA and Chief of the Public Corruption/Government Fraud section at the DC US Attorney's Office about the path forward for bringing Trump to justice.  How do we know if Merrick Garland is moving fast enough?  What laws need to be adjusted to prevent corruption in the future?  Will Trump be charged with obstruction of justice.  All these questions and more are discussed in this timely conversation.  Join us.\nIn the bonus segment, David and Kavita are joined by Asha Rangappa of Yale University and Norm Eisen of the Brookings Institution to continue the conversation, determine the likelihood of a seditious conspiracy charge, and discuss the potential of prosecution at the state level.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
