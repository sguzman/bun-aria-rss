  "description": "<p><span class=\"pillar-article blockquote\">The criminal justice system presents a lot of issues, the least of which is discrimination. . . despite what the public may think. Over decades, prosecutors have slowly taken power and responsibility away from the jury and into their own hands, destroying the premise of “presumed innocent until proven guilty.” Statutory immunity, legal discretion and the opaqueness of the criminal justice system are all much bigger problems than discrimination, which is, in fact, a much less negative term than we generally think. But why are these things such big issues? Join Antony Davies and James Harrigan this week with special guest, criminal justice attorney Catherine Barnard as they explore some of the biggest issues with today’s justice system.</span></p> <p><strong>Show Notes:</strong></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.massgeneral.org/about/pressrelease.aspx?id=2262\">Cure for diabetes</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.washingtonpost.com/news/business/wp/2018/06/19/house-gop-plan-would-cut-medicare-social-security-to-balance-budget/?utm_term=.1632e0b5744e\"> Republican proposal to balance the budget by cutting entitlements</a></p> <p><a href= \"https://www.whitehouse.gov/wp-content/uploads/2018/02/budget-fy2019.pdf\"> Proposed 2019 Federal budget</a></p> <p><strong>Foolishness of the week</strong></p> <p><a href= \"http://www.dailymail.co.uk/news/article-5877545/Sarah-Sanders-gets-kicked-Virginia-restaurant.html\"> Sarah Huckabee Sanders kicked out of restaurant</a></p> <p><strong>Topic of the week: Equality under the law</strong></p> <p><a href=\"http://bernardlawoffices.com/about/\">Catherine Bernard</a></p> <p><strong>James and Ant on Twitter</strong></p> <p>@JamesRHarrigan</p> <p>@AntonyDavies</p> <p> </p> <p> </p>",
