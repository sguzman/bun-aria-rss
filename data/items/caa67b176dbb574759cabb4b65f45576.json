  "description": "<p>Fair and fact-based news helps people make good decisions. That's why journalists work hard to get their facts straight. In the third installment of our series \"Prove It: How to find the facts,\" we'll hear how one daring reporter got herself locked in a mental hospital to uncover injustice. We'll meet an 11-year old publishing her own paper and Washington Post reporter David Fahrenthold tell us how he makes sure his stories are accurate. And we'll find out if the claim that fish have no memory holds water. All that plus a fresh new Mystery Sound and a Moment of Um tackling the question: why do humans have a tailbone but no tail?  Todayâ€™s episode is sponsored by Build-A-Bear Workshop (buildabear.com), Vamousse (VamousseLice.com) and Quip (getquip.com/brainson). You can support Brains On at brainson.org/donate</p>\n",
