Amy joined us as a designer on the Splendid Sampler and her block has been published, we all love it! She has a brand new online Craftsy class on using precuts. I'm super excited about this because my fabric lines with Moda always have precuts, so it's exciting to have a chat about precuts with Amy, she is going explain some amazing things you may not know, and cool ways to use them!\nhttp://www.diaryofaquilter.com/ \n--------------\nI was charmed right away by Nicole Young's projects, and she is a very generous maker.
