  "description": "Hey HBs! Another friend is here! Jenny Nordbak joins Erin and Melody to discuss her new podcast Bonkers Romance and her romance debut HIS LEADING LADY. She's releasing a scorchingly hot contemporary romance about a Hollywood A-List actor who's trying to roughen up his squeaky clean image and an elite dominatrix who doesn't want the limelight, but can't help but be drawn to his mysterious charisma. There's fake dating and BDSM training and it's a book you absolutely have to read! Then, we recap Netflix rom-com He's All That, a gender bent remake of 90's treasure She's All That. Come play with us!\n Bonus Content: \n Matthew Lillard is a national treasure, wax play Jenny doesn't approve of, The Matrix vs. Big Hero Six, Mel's special \"party backbend,\" Mel flexes her horse girl cred yet again, we image horse car washes, bestiality loopholes for centaur romances, and nutella. It's a ride! \n Lady Loves: \n Mel: Amazon's new musical Cinderella with Billy Porter. It's so delicious even while being extremely cringey. \n Erin: Drive Me Crazy, the far superior gender-bent remake of She's All That with Melissa Joan Hart and Adrian Grenier's floppy curls. ALSO, it's spooky season! Enjoy being a pumpkinslut without shame! \n Jenny: the podcast \"I Will Teach You to Be Rich\" with Ramit Sethi.
