(<a href=\"https://www.institutionalinvestor.com/article/b20dyqd5z1p3xc/The-Death-of-Crypto-Has-Been-Greatly-Exaggerated-Again\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Institutional Investor</a>)</p>\n<p>• <strong>Why Today’s Inflation is Not a Repeat of the 1970s</strong>: I’m not a huge fan of the Federal Reserve’s current policy choices. They obviously had to do something about the persistently high inflation but I think they run the risk of overdoing it. The magnitude of their interest rate hikes increases the risk of something breaking in the financial system. (<a href=\"https://awealthofcommonsense.com/2022/11/why-todays-inflation-is-not-a-repeat-of-the-1970s/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">A Wealth of Common Sense</a>) <em>see also</em> <strong>When Your Only Tool is a Hammer</strong>: The FOMC seems to believe that middle-class purchases of homes and automobiles are where they can best strangle inflation. This is needlessly damaging at best, and ineffective at worst. (<a href=\"https://ritholtz.com/2022/11/when-your-only-tool-is-a-hammer/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">The Big Picture</a>)</p>\n<p>• <strong>How job openings explain everything in the economy and the markets right now</strong>: The level and trajectory of this metric has been very telling.
