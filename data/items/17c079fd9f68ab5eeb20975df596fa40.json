  "title": "What Moves You Forward? Internal vs. External Motivation [91]",
  "description": "<p>This week, we're discussing the ways in which we motivate ourselves and move our work forward. Sometimes that comes from external input such as workshops, groups and one-on-one coaching. Sometimes we find the inspiration within ourselves. In this episode, we share our experiences of workshops, discuss how we choose the right teachers, and make suggestions on how you might evaluate a course before signing up. &nbsp;Questions to ask include whether you prefer learning in a group, how much instruction you want (vs exploring on your own), and whether you enjoy listening to the person leading the workshop. Alice makes the point that when we are drawn towards a specific workshop, it can often be a sign that we should explore that topic on our own. Often it's worth asking whether you can teach yourself what you need to know, either from online videos, books, or just through practicing in your studio. We also discuss finding the motivation internally - how can you ensure that you feel good about your work so that you want to go into your studio? How can you find the motivation to show up regularly? And how can you create the right emotional state for yourself so that you can move your art forward?&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned:</strong></p>\n<p>Trust by Jonathan Hall<strong> </strong><a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000mb2k\">https://www.bbc.co.uk/programmes/m000mb2k</a></p>\n<p>Ghosts - BBC -<a href=\"https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m00049t9/ghosts\">https://www.bbc.co.uk/iplayer/episodes/m00049t9/ghosts</a></p>\n<p>Find us and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\">bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</a></p>\n<p>Support the podcast with a small donation at: <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\">https://ko-fi.com/artjuice</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p>Alice <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com@alicesheridanstudio/\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p>Louise <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n<p><br></p>\n",
