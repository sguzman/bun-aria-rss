  "description": "In today's podcast, we hear that VPNFilter, described by Cisco's Talos research unit, looks like battlespace preparation for Fancy Bear. The FBI may have succeeded in impeding its operation. Dragos describes XENOTIME, the threat actor behind the TRISIS industrial safety system attacks, and they say we can expect them back. GDPR is coming tomorrow, and a company has found a way of letting worried CISOs sleep at night. And your right to follow theRealDonaldTrump on Twitter has now been secured by the US Federal Court for the Southern District of New York. Enjoy. Dr. Charles Clancy from the Hume Center at VA Tech, discussing how cell towers track you even when you have location services disabled (and why that’s a good thing). Guest is Erez Yalon from Checkmarx with their research on Amazon Echo eavesdropping vulnerabilities.",
