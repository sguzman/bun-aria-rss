Skeptics are fond of asking, as though no answer were remotely possible, \"HOW could an eight-foot-tall primate exist undiscovered in our back yard?\" Meeting the issue head-on, THE MIND OF SASQUATCH outlines the Sasquatch Savant Theory, revealing a personality profile of the species that differs substantially from any offered before. Sasquatch are hardwired by evolution to conceal themselves, interacting with us only in a mediated, indirect fashion. Their tactical genius and other striking abilities mirror gifts seen in people known as autistic savants.\"</p> <p>Should be an interesting night discussing behaviors of these creatures.</p> <p> </p> <p>I will also be speaking to Claudia Ackley who will be sharing her encounter and talking about her lawsuit against California State.</p>",
