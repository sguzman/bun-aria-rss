  "description": "Democrats in Congress are trying to revive the Equal Rights Amendment, which supposedly will guarantee equal rights for women in America. The problem is that women already have equal rights, so what will this amendment really do? We'll talk about it. Also, are people who recline their seats on airplanes sociopaths? We discuss. And I answer emails from some listeners who think I'm a bad Christian for saying that we should teach our children to fight back against bullies.\n\nCheck out The Cold War: What We Saw, a new podcast written and presented by Bill Whittle at https://www.dailywire.com/coldwar. In Part 1 we peel back the layers of mystery cloaking the Terror state run by the Kremlin, and watch as America takes its first small steps onto the stage of world leadership.\n\nIf you like The Matt Walsh Show, become a member TODAY with promo code: WALSH and enjoy the exclusive benefits for 10% off at https://www.dailywire.com/Walsh\nLearn more about your ad choices.
