  "description": "<p>Dear Steve and Shirley, I'm writing you for advice on a family matter. When my daughter had her first child, she and her husband asked me to move in with them to help out with the baby. I was thrilled to be there to help with my grandchild. After living with them for about five months my daughter came to me and said that her husband had been watching me move around the house. I thought she meant that he was watching me to see how I handled the baby. I didn't think anything about it. Once again my daughter came to me and said that her husband was watching me and that she felt some type of way about it. Now she had my full attention. This was no joking matter.......</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
