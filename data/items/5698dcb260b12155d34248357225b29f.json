  "itunes:subtitle": "Histories and Theories of Sound",
  "itunes:summary": "Seth Kim-Cohen places rock and roll next to conceptual art, poststructualism and politics, foregrounding it as an active participant in a wider social conversation. Focusing on 1965 to 1985, rock and roll is no longer just a soundtrack to a generation but is equally responsible for greater transformations of the time.\nSeth Kim-Cohen is an artist, musician, and writer who makes as little distinction between these categories as he can get away with.\n\nhttps://liquidarchitecture.org.au/events/nofuture\n\nTheories and Histories of Sound\n18 August, 2016\nMADA, Monash University\nPresented by Liquid Architecture and MADA\n\nImage: Bianca Morgans\n\nFinancial support from patrons at any level has a resounding impact on our work.
