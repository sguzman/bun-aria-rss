  "description": "<p>On this episode of Battles & Banter, Avery, Codie & Tony are joined by recurring guest host and Civil War historian Ryan Quint to discuss the 160th anniversary of one of the bloodiest battles from the American Civil War; a battle that set the tone for how horrific the battles would become for the rest of the conflict. Along the west banks of the Tennessee River, the Confederate Army of Mississippi under General Albert Sidney Johnston attacked the U.S. Army of the Tennessee under Major General Ulysses S. Grant while they were encamped in the woods around Pittsburg Landing. The two-day engagement fought on April 6-7, 1862 would become better known by the name of a small, wooden Methodist church on site, which translated to \"Place of Peace\" in Hebrew. The guys discuss the battle and its far-reaching consequences not only on the war itself, but in the larger context of Civil War memory. Enjoy!</p>",
