  "title": "42: Sebene Selassie, A Life of Service While Fighting Breast Cancer",
  "description": "Sebene Selassie's career has taken her all over the world. An Ethiopian immigrant, Selassie grew up in the Washington, D.C., area. Her father left her family in the '70s to go back to Ethiopia and became a guerrilla fighter in the Eritrean independence movement. Her brother became a \"Hare Krishna\" devotee. Selassie, however, found meditation, and started practicing in high school. She studied Comparative Religious studies at McGill University and went on to work with not-for-profits in international development, including in refugee camps in Guinea. She was a self-professed \"really bad dharma student,\" until she was diagnosed with stage-three breast cancer at age 34. Then she says she became \"a really good dharma student.\" Selassie has now survived breast cancer three times and works as a meditation teacher and transformational coach in New York City.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
