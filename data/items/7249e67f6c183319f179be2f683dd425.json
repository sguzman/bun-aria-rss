  "description": "<p>One of Oprah’s favorite quotes comes from German mystic Meister Eckhart. He said, “If the only prayer you say in your entire life is ‘<em>thank you</em>,’ that will be enough.” Oprah says when she started keeping a gratitude journal more than 20 years ago, it was one of the most important things she’s done. The daily practice of writing down five things to be grateful for balanced her life in subtle and inspiring ways. \"It sounds simple,” Oprah says, “but when you go through the day staying conscious about what you put on your gratitude list, it shifts the lens through which you see the world.” In this episode of Super Soul, Oprah sits down with luminaries like Mark Nepo, Ram Dass, Elizabeth Lesser, Reverend Ed Bacon, Tracey Jackson, Paul Williams, Geneen Roth, Cheryl Strayed, Caroline Myss, Gretchen Rubin, Shawn Achor, Marie Forleo, Lynne Twist, Louie Schwartzberg and Norman Lear to discover that the practice of gratitude can elevate our lives to a state of grace. Interviews with these talented writers, speakers and thought leaders are excerpted from Oprah’s Emmy Award-winning show <em>Super Soul Sunday</em>. You can also find this compilation and other insightful conversations in Oprah’s best-selling book <em>The Wisdom of Sundays</em>.</p>\n",
