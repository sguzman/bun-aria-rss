  "title": "#74: Nothing to Ad (Bret Weinstein & Heather Heying DarkHorse Livestream)",
  "description": "<p>In this 74th in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens. This episode marks the first episode in which we broadcast ads. After speaking two ads at the top of the show, we devote the rest of the episode to a critique of advertising, a history of ads in nature (bird plumage or song, bright coloration or patterning on a toxic frog or butterfly), and a discussion of how ads have been used to drive editorial content in some places, notably magazines aimed at women and girls. We then provide eight pro bono ads: products or things that we think are awesome (or not), and why we think so. This was fun; we hope you think so, too.<br/><br/>Our book, A Hunter-Gatherer’s Guide to the 21st Century, is now available for pre-sale at amazon.
