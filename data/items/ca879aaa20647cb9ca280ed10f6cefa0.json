  "description": "<p>My guest tonight is “MT” from Washington State. He was a school teacher for many years and always worked for the state wildlife services before he was fired for coming forward with his encounter. He says, “I made the mistake of telling some of my co-workers about my encounter, I was fired afterwards without any reason and was blackballed from the industry...”</p> <p>MT goes on to explain what he saw... “When I had my close up sighting of the bigfoot that was over 11 feet tall up near Mt. Rainier National Park, just west of Ashford, Washington, you could see the muscles bulging beneath the short fur covering as the creature reached up to move the branch from in front of its face as it walked into the woods… also, that the creature was truly of gigantic stature. If you saw the movie Prometheus with the gigantic humanoid aliens, my Bigfoot was about the same build. It was nothing but muscle and hair.</p> <p>I tell people that it resembled a silver back gorilla crossed with an Olympic athlete (summer track events), crossed with a giant. It looked like a tall person crossing the road… and the arms were not down almost to the knees like a lot of people say… it had the perfect human proportions a tall athletic man… except for the huge hump of muscles across the shoulders behind the head, and that the ear seemed to be in the wrong location on the side of the head for a human and looked more like where it would be on a big silver back gorilla.”</p> <p> </p> <p>If you have had an encounter and would like to be on the show, send me an email at wes@sasquatchchronicles.com.</p>",
