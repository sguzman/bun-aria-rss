  "description": "<p>r/AmITheA**hole In today's episode, OP lives next to a spoiled little brat who keeps trying to prank him with ding dong ditch. OP sets up a camera to figure out who the culprit is, and then sets a trap. He patiently waits behind his front door with a bucket of water. The next time the neighborhood kid comes to prank OP again, OP just opens the door and douses the kid with a bucket of water! Of course, the kid goes and whines to his parents, who call OP the butthole for pranking their precious baby.</p>\n",
