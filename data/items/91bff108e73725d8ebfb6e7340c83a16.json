  "description": "In Episode #211, I sit down with Dr Jared Raynes to discuss precision fermentation and the future of dairy.\n\nAs our world becomes more populated and animal agriculture continues to unsustainably expand, we need to examine alternatives to the products people know and love. While animal-free dairy may sound like an impossible feat, innovation in the field of precision fermentation is proving otherwise. Dr Jared Raynes joins me today to explain what precision fermentation is, where this technology is now, and where it can take us in the future.\n\nBy listening to this episode, you’ll gain an understanding of what precision fermentation is from both a scientific and outcome-based perspective. We break down the benefits of animal-free dairy, explain how it is created, and address potential concerns about genetic modification. Dr Raynes also offers insight into where this technology is used already, where it’s heading, and when we can expect to see animal-free dairy products on the shelves.\n\nSpecifically, we cover:\n\nIntro (0:00)\n\nBiochemistry & Jared’s story (4:08)\n\nStudying recreating casein (8:59)\n\nAlternative protein companies (24:45)\n\nPrecision fermentation explained (27:39)\n\nGMOs: what can go wrong (33:00)\n\nWhat’s possible with precision fermentation (41:25)\n\nEnvironmental changes (53:00)\n\nLooking forward (1:00:15)\n\nOutro (1:17:40)\n\n\nIf you found this episode insightful, you can connect with Dr Raynes on LinkedIn. You can also discover more of All G Foods, who Dr Raynes works for, on their website, Instagram, Twitter, and LinkedIn profiles. Learn more about their brands Buds Burger and Milk Cell through the linked websites.\n\nThank you to The Proof friend Eimele Essential 8 for sponsoring today’s episode.
