  "description": "<p>We asked our audience to send in their own salon horror stories and you guys DELIVERED! From chemical haircuts to clients who get physical when things don't go their way, our listeners have been put through the wringer. You're all definitely going to heaven and probably got extra bonus points for dealing with the coworker from hell. And above all, know you're not alone! This business is rough and there is a ton of pressure, but that's because it's creating a bunch of diamonds. So sit back, get comfy, and listen as hairstylists across the U.S. share tales of their own personal hells.</p>",
