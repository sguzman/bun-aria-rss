I hold zero punches in this one and give some <span class=\"il\">tough</span> <span class= \"il\">love</span> to a platform that’s very much responsible for my early notoriety. It pains me that <span class=\"il\">Twitter</span> hasn’t adapted much over the years and that it's not as impactful anymore (especially since I have such a large following there). In this one we go deep where I give them suggestions on how to update their platform, Periscope vs. other streaming platforms, how <span class=\"il\">Twitter </span>can beat Facebook, and how they can win the live event space. </p> <div class=\"yj6qo ajU\"> </div><img src=\"http://feedpress.me/9857/5260264.gif\" height=\"1\" width=\"1\"/>",
