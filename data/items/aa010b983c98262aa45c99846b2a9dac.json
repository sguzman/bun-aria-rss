  "description": "Volodymyr Zelensky courageously revealed his location in a speech intended to rally the world to Ukraine’s aid, while the women in Ukraine are demonstrating their bravery by taking up arms, and, in one case, taking out a Russian drone with a jar of pickled tomatoes. Meanwhile, anyone with information about a missing box of human heads is encouraged to call the Denver Police Department right away. Next, John. C. Reilly grew out his hair during lockdown and used the extra length to pull off a truly epic combover hairstyle for his portrayal of Lakers boss Jerry Buss in the new HBO series, “Winning Time.” And Kristin Chenoweth returns to the show to wow Stephen and Jon with her impressive vocal chops. Kristin’s new book, “What Will I Do With My Love Today?” is available everywhere now. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
