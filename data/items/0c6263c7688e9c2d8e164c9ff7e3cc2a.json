  "title": "PMS 2.0 193 - The Most Interesting Man In Sports, Andrew Brandt Stops By For A Chat. Also, Brandon Flowers and Legend, AJ Hawk. Draft Recap & Last Dance Talk. Let's Go.",
  "description": "On today's show, Pat sits down with the most interesting man in sports, Andrew Brandt, who was the Vice President of Finance for the Green Bay Packers and formerly an agent working with David Falk, and who represented several NFL stars. Pat and Andrew chat about his career path and what made him want to get into the business, he chats about repping Adam Vinatieri and how he nearly got him to the Packers, David Falk's involvement in creating the Air Jordan moniker, and why the Packers drafting Aaron Rodgers when he was in charge is much different than what they did this year with Jordan Love (00:00:42-13:43). Also included is another segment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk, where Pat and AJ recap this year's draft and still try to make sense of what the Packers are doing, and why it seems like they're moving in the wrong direction. They also discuss episodes 3 & 4 of The Last Dance and how much differently things would be if they were to happen today, and discuss what it was like on their respective team planes after wins in the NFL (16:11-1:34:55). Later, Pro Bowler, former cornerback for the Chiefs and Chargers, and friend of the show, Brandon Flowers joins the program. Pat and Brandon discuss the NFL Draft and which teams he thinks got better over the weekend and which teams left him scratching his head, what he thinks about Cam Newton playing for the New England Patriots, why Bill Belichick drafted players become dominant within his system, and what he thinks the Chargers are ultimately going to do at Quarterback (1:36:51-1:46:27). Today's show is a good one. Don't forget to send in the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat with a picture of where you're listening to the show for the chance to win some free merch. Stay safe out there and thank you for rocking with us. Come and laugh with us, cheers.\n",
