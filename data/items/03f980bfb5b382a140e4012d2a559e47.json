  "description": "<p><p>Kirk Minihane gets the Rough & Rowdy treatment with Big Fricka and Gun Show. Tomorrow evening Big Frick will be fighting for the honor of the Commonwealth of Massachusetts, while Gun Show will be fighting on behalf of Rhode Island and the previously incarcerated. We're also joined by Krissy, a Rough N' Rowdy ring girl who will be wearing a special Kirk Minihane outfit. An Orthodox Jew joins the show to explain why he won't be able to attend the live show in Madawaska. Minihane books his own hotel room during the show and decides he's not a big fan of French Canadian customer service.
