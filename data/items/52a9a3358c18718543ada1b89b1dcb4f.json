Meanwhile, the U.S. has called for an impartial investigation into Abu Akleh’s death, but has stopped short of leading such a probe. \n\nGuest: Dalia Hatuqa, a journalist specializing in Israeli/Palestinian affairs and regional Middle East issues.\n\nIf you enjoy this show, please consider signing up for Slate Plus.
