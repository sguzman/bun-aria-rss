  "description": "<p>A listener writes “I’m going to try and keep this as short as possible but I have had about a half dozen encounters with what I used to think, but now KNOW, was a Sasquatch or something thereof.</p> <p>My cousin and my brother have spent the past week talking about all of our encounters here in AZ up off the Mogollon Rim and out at our family ranch north of Wickenburg. My cousin Chris came upon your show less than a week ago by accident and we have each listened to about 35-40 of the episodes since. He and I have talked over the past few days and because of what we’ve heard on your show, we are CONVINCED that what we’ve encountered is similar to those on your show. The timing worked out where my brother, who is active in the military, is in town and staying with us so the three of us have been reliving these experiences trying to find answers.</p> <p>The first memory was at our family ranch out in the middle of the desert where the nearest house or living human is a 45 minute drive down a dirt road. I was about 14 or 15 and my brother is two years younger than me. He and I heard the horses making a ton of noise down in the pasture in the creek that runs alongside the mountain the ranch houses sit on. We walked to the edge of the slope of the mountain where we could see below and saw the horses huddled together in the middle of our fenced in pasture. We caught glances of what we thought was a coyote in between the brush so we yelled down and made some noise. As soon as we did, this thing took off down the wash towards the Hassayampa river. We saw it running and it was big and black. It ran kind of like a dog but was 90-100 yards away below in the wash so it was thought to tell. It darted between the mesquite and the brush but it was jet black. If it was a canine, it was the biggest one we have ever seen. Running on all fours, it’s back had to be at least as high as my chest at the time but it was very bulky. When we asked our grandpa about it he said it was a bear but we have never seen a bear move that fast or agile.</p> <p>We had another encounter while sitting on the porch of the ranch house at night a few years later. My cousin and I were sitting on the porch with a girl from Germany and the rest of the family was inside. About 30 yards away, just outside of the light coming from the sliding glass door, we heard some movement for a few minutes, then the deepest growl I could have possibly ever imagined. It last for a few seconds and my cousin and I slowly got up on our feet. We looked at each other terrified and pulled our guns out. The SECOND I cocked the hammer back on my revolver, the growl turned into this terrifying scream. It didn’t sound like the typical woman scream you hear about, it sounded like a dinosaur. We threw open the door and slammed it shut and our family told us we looked like we had just seen a ghost. Neither of us slept that night.</p> <p>Around the time I was 19, my brother and a different cousin of ours had walked about a mile up river to do some target shooting with a shotgun. We didn’t have a lot of time before dinner so we were only shooting for 10-15 minutes before we headed back home. Walking down the creek we saw a jet black raven sitting in the middle of the creek. It was huge and wasn’t afraid of us. It had to sit 2.5′ talk and I have never seen a raven out there in that area. We walked by and didn’t think anything of it but as we got close to the house we saw a massive black creature on the side of the wash in the brush. At the time we all thought it was a bull but even then we thought it was pretty strange to see one off on its own that close to the house. 10-15 seconds later, when we turned to look back at it, it was completely gone. We asked our grandpa about a big black bull and he told us that we didn’t have any.</p> <p>I was 23 when I went camping off the Young road up on the Mogollon rim with some buddies. After the sun went down, we had a fire going and started hearing what we all thought was a woman screaming off in the distance. Over a minute or two the scream got closer until it was just outside the firelight and less than 30 yards from us. We were all freaked out since it sounded like this woman was dying. We called out and shined our flashlights towards it but never got a response or saw anything. Over a period of an hour, we heard some noises near by but eventually it got quiet and then we started hearing the screams again but the were moving away from us. We all slept in the truck that night and left the next morning.</p> <p>My last encounter was again, near the Mogollon rim with my cousin Chris, his wife, and a friend from work as his wife. The story is pretty long but we had heard screams in the forest during the day and after the sun went down we started to hear whistles coming in from at least 3 different positions getting closer to us. We saw red, green, and white lights coming down one of the hills that bordered the wash we were camping in. They were very soft lights like a glow stick in the distance. We would hear branches breaking and someone walking up the road. We would go out to look and couldn’t ever find anything. The whistles and noises would ebb and flow but during a period of quiet, our friend and his wife went to bed in their tent. The noises started up again and our dogs went so crazy we had to put them all in our trucks. My cousin, his wife, and I sat on his tailgate near the fire hearing at least 3 distinct whistles coming from different areas like we were being flanked. His wife didn’t read too much into it but we were terrified. I’ve got tears in my eyes just thinking about it. When one of the whistles got within 40 yards and right on the creek, I whistled into the dark and immediately, this thing immediately whistled right back to me in the exact same tone. The three of us panicked, we woke up our friends, packed up our camp within 10 minutes and left there in the middle of the night.”</p> <p> </p> <p>https://sasquatchchronicles.com</p> <p> </p> <p> </p> <p><a href=\"mailto:wes@sasquatchchronicles.com\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">wes@sasquatchchronicles.com</a></p>",
