  "title": "42 - Seismic Mike Responds to Godless Part 1",
  "description": "In this episode we re-visit some questions asked by our agnostic atheist friend Godless, from our previous podcast with him.  In addition, we also read an email response from \"Jeremy\", who was the topic of our last episode responding to his questions around the controversial non-affirming opinion used against folks in the LGBTQ community.  Mike has never heard of the movie RAD from 1986, also mentioned in this show.  It's reference is below for your enjoyment in the producer notes.\n\nDisclaimer*: We clearly understand the perceived unfairness of this format in which we are having the chance to respond to very big questions asked by our friends here, without them present on the show.  However, this day and age it seems rare that we get to listen to a complete thought before it is interrupted by your opposing debater.  Furthermore, permission has been granted to respond in this way in which we will offer the last word for our guests as they have the opportunity to digest these thoughts in full presentation while not  engaged in partial conversation.   \n\nA bit about Godless:\n\nGodless is the co-host on the Metal Sucks Podcast, and identifies as a agnostic atheist.  Tweet Godless on Twitter at @Godlessspeaks and you can engage in his content at www.chuckandgodless.com.\n\nCheck out the previous episodes regarding Godless:\n\n\"How to Talk with an Atheist with guest Godless\" Listen Here:\nhttps://soundcloud.com/user-188492964/39-how-to-talk-with-an-athiest-guest-godless\n\n\"How NOT to Talk to an Atheist with guest Mark Salomon\" Listen Here: \nhttps://soundcloud.com/user-188492964/25-how-not-to-talk-to-an-atheist-guest-mark-salomon\n\n\n- Mike Erre\n\nLearn more about the VOX Podcast:\nwww.voxpodcast.com\n\nSubscribe on iTunes - http://apple.co/1Lla1Nj\n\nFollow Mike on Twitter www.twitter.com/mikeerre\nLike Mike on Facebook www.facebook.com/officialmikeerre\n",
