  "description": "<p>In this extra special, semi-sloppy episode of Drunken Philosophy, Connor and Dan revisit an old nemesis, Australian utilitarian philosopher Peter Singer. They discuss the Melbourne-born man's thoughts on charity, animal rights, and infant euthanasia. Spoiler alert: they don't hate everything he has to say. But Singer certainly lives up to his title of \"Controversial Philosopher In Residence.\" Handle this episode with care, it's a spicy one.</p>",
