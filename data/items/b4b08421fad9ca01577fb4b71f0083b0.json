  "description": "<p>The core operation of current Graph Neural Networks (GNNs) is the aggregation\nenabled by the graph Laplacian or message passing, which filters the\nneighborhood node information. Though effective for various tasks, in this\npaper, we show that they are potentially a problematic factor underlying all\nGNN methods for learning on certain datasets, as they force the node\nrepresentations similar, making the nodes gradually lose their identity and\nbecome indistinguishable. Hence, we augment the aggregation operations with\ntheir dual, i.e. diversification operators that make the node more distinct and\npreserve the identity. Such augmentation replaces the aggregation with a\ntwo-channel filtering process that, in theory, is beneficial for enriching the\nnode representations. In practice, the proposed two-channel filters can be\neasily patched on existing GNN methods with diverse training strategies,\nincluding spectral and spatial (message passing) methods. In the experiments,\nwe observe desired characteristics of the models and significant performance\nboost upon the baselines on 9 node classification tasks.\n</p>",
