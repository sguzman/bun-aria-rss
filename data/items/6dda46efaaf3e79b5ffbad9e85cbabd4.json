  "description": "<p><strong>We’ve found many church staff teams operate in one of two extremes: </strong></p> <p><strong>They get along with each other but struggle to execute plans... or they are impressively productive but unhealthy and dysfunctional.</strong></p> <p>The undercurrent is often that we church leaders can get so busy \"doing\" ministry that we never think about how we \"do\" team.</p> <p>It's the Sunday's always coming syndrome. But the truth is, a church's kingdom impact is directly correlated with the health and performance of its team. Your team is the most valuable asset you have in making progress toward your vision.</p> <p>In this episode, we're sharing a portion of our recent webinar featuring Tony Morgan, Amy Anderson and Lance Witt that focused on what we're learning about healthy, high-performing church staff teams. </p> <p>For the full episode transcript, links mentioned during the show, and to download the Leader Conversation Guide, visit this episode's <strong>Show Notes</strong> at <a href= \"https://tonymorganlive.com/2019/10/09/get-your-church-staff-unstuck-episode-114-the-unstuck-church-podcast/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\"><strong>theunstuckgroup.com/episode114</strong></a>.</p> <p><em><strong>Join the Live Conversation on Social Media</strong></em></p> <p>If you're listening on Wednesday, when the episode first releases, join the live conversation The Unstuck Group's team will be having on social media about this week's topic.
