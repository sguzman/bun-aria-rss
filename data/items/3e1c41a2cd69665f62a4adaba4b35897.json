  "description": "<p>Recent surveys have shown that anxiety and depression are up amongst school-aged children and teens. Parents and teachers are also reporting a decrease in motivation amongst young adults. My guests today argue that both issues stem from the same problem and can be solved with the same solution.  </p><p>Their names are Bill Stixrud and Ned Johnson.

In their book, <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/product/B072KBWB6G/ref=as_li_tl?ie=UTF8&camp=1789&creative=390957&creativeASIN=B072KBWB6G&linkCode=as2&tag=stucosuccess&linkId=FSXA3GZUT5SFDAZ4\" target=\"_blank\"><em>The Self-Driven Child</em></a><em>, </em>they make the case that modern helicopter parenting and highly structured school schedules and after-school activities are part of the problem of increased anxiety and decreased motivation amongst young people. The solution is to start letting your kids make their own choices and experience the consequences of those choices — both the good and the bad. Today on the show, we discuss specific ways parents can let their kids make their own decisions and why this doesn’t mean you let your kids do whatever they want. With each tip, they explain the science of why it helps increase intrinsic motivation. Lots of great actionable advice. Even if you’re not a parent, you'll find the advice on developing intrinsic motivation to actually be pretty helpful for grown-ups too. </p><p>After the show is over, get the full notes at <a href=\"http://aom.is/selfdrivenchild\" target=\"_blank\">aom.is/selfdrivenchild</a>.</p>\n",
