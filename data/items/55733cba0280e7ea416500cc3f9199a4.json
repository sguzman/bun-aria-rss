  "description": "<p>In this work, we study the effect of a moving detector on a discrete time one\ndimensional Quantum Random Walk where the movement is realized in the form of\nhopping/shifts. The occupation probability $f(x,t;n,s)$ is estimated as the\nnumber of detection $n$ and number of shift $s$ vary. It is seen that the\noccupation probability at the initial position $x_D$ of the detector is\nenhanced when $n$ is small which a quantum mechanical effect but decreases when\n$n$ is large. The ratio of occupation probabilities of our walk to that of an\nInfinite walk shows a scaling behavior of $\\frac{1}{n^2}$. It shows a definite\nscaling behavior with number of shifts $s$ also. The limiting behaviours of the\nwalk are observed when $x_D$ is large, $n$ is large and $s$ is large and the\nwalker for these cases approach the Infinite Walk, The Semi Infinite Walk and\nthe Quenched Quantum Walk respectively.\n</p>",
