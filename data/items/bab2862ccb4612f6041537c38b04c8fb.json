  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">Old Testament professor and friend of the show, Dr. John Walton is back with his latest book in the “Lost World” series. This time he’s tackling common misunderstandings about the Old Testament Law. Walton says modern people incorrectly see the Torah as legislation—laws to be obeyed, but that’s not how Ancient Near Eastern cultures saw it. And the traditional division of OT laws into civil, moral, and ceremonial categories is also misguided. So what does that mean for us? Phil and Skye pepper the prof with questions. Also this week—archeologists find King Josiah under a parking lot (maybe), and herpes in space!</p>",
