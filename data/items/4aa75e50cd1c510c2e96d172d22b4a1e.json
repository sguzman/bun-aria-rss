  "description": "Today, two takes on stories we tell to make ourselves feel better and the consequences of believing them. First, author Danielle Evans' short story collection, <em>The Office of Historical Corrections</em>. The title story is about a fictional agency that fact checks in real time but, as she told former NPR host Noel King, it's less powerful than you might think. Then, the story of a Black woman's decision to pass as white and the decades-long fallout of that choice, in <em>The Vanishing Half</em>. Author Brit Bennett told NPR's Mary Louise Kelly that the point of the story isn't to moralize.",
