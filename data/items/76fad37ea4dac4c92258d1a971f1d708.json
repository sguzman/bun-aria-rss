The problem is that we’re never taught how to seek, create, nurture, and assess our relationships the same way we do our careers and bank accounts. But the cost of bad relationships on ourselves and our society truly adds up. The relationships many of us grew up around and might consider “normal” are in fact dysfunctional, creating a negative cycle we often don’t even realize we’re in. So how can we find good love, create good relationships, and keep them? That’s what today’s conversation with Mia Lux is all about.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Mia merges the playful and the profound—drawing on her experience as a start-up CEO, stand-up comedian, personal growth junkie, and recovering lawyer. For over 7 years, Mia has been an international host, comedian & facilitator, specializing in designing and facilitating top wellness/personal development experiences around the world.
