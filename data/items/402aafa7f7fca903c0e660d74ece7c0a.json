  "description": "<p>On Summer House, love is in the air — but like, in the same way asbestos might be in the air if you go to the wrong building.  Lindsay and Carl are official, and so now it's time for them to go on their first date! In this case, that means supermarket sushi on a rooftop with Fireball.  Never have we wished more for an actual fireball to descend upon them.  Meanwhile, Kyle and Amanda have run out of passion, and Luke still wants to get with Hannah.  Why do we love this show so much??<br />\n<br /><hr /><p>See <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://acast.com/privacy\">acast.com/privacy</a> for privacy and opt-out information.</p><p><a href=\"https://patreon.com/watchwhatcrappens\">Our Patreon Extras: https://patreon.com/watchwhatcrappens</a></p></p>\n",
