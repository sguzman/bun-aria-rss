The latest attempt to revive a beloved franchise, or at least that first film, is helmed by the son of the original director, features appearances of the original cast, and is overstuffed with homages.  That’s right, it’s Ghostbusters: Afterlife.  Does it capture the magic of the 1984 original and justify its existence?  Then it’s on to the Netflix original, featuring current Hollywood ‘It Guy’, Johnathan Majors as real-life cowboy, Nat Love, on a quest for vengeance in ‘The Harder They Fall’.  Matt loves him some westerns, so surely this will be right up his alley!  There’s the riveting discussion of the big releases on Physical Media, featuring the Streaming and Straight to DVD Picks of the Week.  Matt and Chris then close out the big show with a truly stunning round of ‘What Are The Odds?!?’ in all it’s hyperbolic glory!
