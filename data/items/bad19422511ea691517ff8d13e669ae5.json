  "description": "<p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">This week on The First Run, Chris and Matt check out the first animated feature for A24, it’s ‘Marcel The Shell With Shoes On’. Jenny Slate and Dean Fleischer-Camp bring their wildly popular shorts to the big screen in a heartwarming tale that hits all the buttons. Perhaps unremarkably so?&nbsp; Then Matt and Chris get their visual poetry on with ‘Days of Heaven’, the first entry in their Terrence Malick Marathon. There’s the electrifying rundown of the big Physical Media Releases, featuring the Straight to DVD and Streaming Picks of the Week. Then the guys wrap up the show by slowing it down for another hip and happening entry of ‘The Lounge’ featuring a breakdown of all the MCU announcements at the San Diego ComicCon. Note: The Warner Bros/Discovery discussion took place just as the Scoob sequel and Batgirl cancellations were announced.&nbsp; All the other recent shenanigans hadn’t broken yet. So put on some smooth jazz, kick back, and take it easy my friend.&nbsp; It’s another chill episode of The First Run.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">00:00-09:24: <strong>Intro/Marcel The Shell With Shoes On</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">09:25-18:41: <strong>Physical Media Picks</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">18:42-29:41: <strong>Days of Heaven</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">29:42-59:28: <strong>The Lounge</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">59:29-1:01:23: <strong>Wrap Up</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Theme music by Jamal Malachi Ford-Bey</p>",
