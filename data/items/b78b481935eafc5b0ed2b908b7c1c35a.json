  "title": "The Match II: Betting Preview, Analysis for Tiger/Manning vs. Phil/Brady (First Cut Golf Podcast Crossover) (5/21)",
  "description": "This weekend two legends of the links team up with legends of the gridiron for a special golf event raising money for COVID-19 relief. Tiger Woods is joining forces with Peyton Manning while Phil Mickelson will partner up with Tom Brady. In the interest of team spirit, we’ve invited Will Brinson from Pick Six NFL Podcast to join our foursome. We’re bringing you our comprehensive preview of “The Match: Champions for Charity” or as we call it, “The Match II”. Where does the Peyton Manning-Tom Brady rivalry stand in the history of great sports rivalries and how does it compare to the rivalry that Tiger Woods and Phil Mickelson developed over the past two decades (5:00)? We also go in depth with a full breakdown of the match format and how it could benefit one team over the other (15:15). Our own Greg DuCharme spent his early days as a golf pro working at Medalist Golf Club, the site of this weekends match. Greg breaks the course down and tells us what to expect (25:10). After the break, we’re hitting you with our picks and favorite props for this weekend. Can Tiger and Peyton close out Phil and Brady early? We go into why Lefty and Tom Terrific might just have some magic up their sleeve stun Big Cat and The Sheriff (30:45)?\n—————————\n'First Cut' is available on Apple Podcasts, Spotify, Stitcher, Castbox and wherever else you listen to podcasts. \n\nFollow our hosts on Twitter: @KylePorterCBS, @mark_immelman, @RickRunGood, @therealGFD\n\nFor more golf coverage from CBS Sports, visit https://www.cbssports.com/golf/\nTo hear more from the CBS Sports Podcast Network, visit https://www.cbssports.com/podcasts/\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
