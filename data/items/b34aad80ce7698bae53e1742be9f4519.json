  "description": "<p>Energy is such a major piece to overall wellness—we don’t feel very motivated to practice self-care and pursue the things we love if we simply don’t have the energy. So what does it really look like to have great energy, and what can we do in our own lives to create more of it?</p><br><p>Today’s guest on <em>The Doctor’s Farmacy</em> is the perfect person to answer that. Ben Greenfield is a human performance consultant, speaker, and <em>New York Times</em> bestselling author of 13 books, including the wildly popular titles,<em> Beyond Training</em> and <em>Boundless</em>. A former collegiate tennis, water polo, and volleyball player, as well as a bodybuilder, 13-time Ironman triathlete, and professional obstacle course racer, Ben has been voted by the NSCA as America’s top Personal Trainer and by <em>Greatist</em> as one of the top 100 Most Influential People In Health and Fitness. Ben hosts the highly popular fitness, nutrition, and wellness website bengreenfieldfitness.com, a site with over a million monthly visitors, featuring articles, podcasts, and product reviews.
