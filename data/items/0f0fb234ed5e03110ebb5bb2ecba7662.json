  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, under House Resolution 1 (HR-1) and Senate Resolution 1 (SR-1) Democrats aim to impose the most corrupt voting system ever. Democrats went into battleground states in 2020 and destroyed their electoral systems, not to protect minorities, but to protect the Biden campaign by usurping the federal Constitution. Legislatures are pushing back to regain their laws and President Biden is using segregationist rhetoric on them for it. If people are not on board with torching your electoral system Biden will call you a bigot. Biden is now seizing authority from the states to change voting laws and processes, in effect institutionalizing fraud, and it does nothing to help minority voters. Then, the US Supreme Court is corrupt and cowardly. Justices Roberts, Amy Coney-Barrett, and Brett Kavanaugh have turned out to be huge disappointments that have succumbed to threats of pressure from the left. Later, the media has been covering up for Democrats for decades. Now, they're covering for Biden despite his inability to serve as President. Biden can't even remember who runs the military! Afterward, equality and equity are dissimilar, so why do Democrats focus on it so much? In order to institute equity, one can't treat people equally as human beings. Instead, they are recognized for their skin color, for their genitalia, and what they do with their genitalia. This focus on inequity is where Democrats thrive and Biden is having a field day with Executive Orders to address the \"systemic bias\" they promote. \n\nLearn more about your ad choices.
