  "description": "This week, we’re doing things a little differently. Today’s episode covers Daniel’s and my take on the top news… The regular weekly interview segment (featuring the legendary Frank Holmes) will air tomorrow. Let’s get to it... You undoubtedly know by now about the collapse of Chinese property juggernaut Evergrande. Daniel and I debate whether now is a good time to gain exposure to China. [1:23]  Will we see an infrastructure bill this year? Daniel explains why it would make more sense (politically) for Democrats to wait until next year… While I think they’ll want to pass it right away. But regardless of when it happens… I explain why you should be prepared to sell a lot of your stocks when the bill does pass. [12:21] FedEx missed earnings expectations and announced massive price increases… [16:53] Cracker Barrel also missed earnings, and warned about higher commodity and wage costs… [25:14] Finally, Disney warned investors about slowing growth… causing a hit to the stock. [28:17] Is it a good time to buy any of these companies? Daniel and I share our thoughts on each. Enjoyed this episode?
