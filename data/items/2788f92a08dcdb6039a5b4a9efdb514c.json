Then, they're looking at the year ahead, setting goals, intentions and making commitments and resolutions about what they \"want\" to happen. Reflecting, learning and then setting intentions, and goals is a good thing.</p><p>But there's one thing that's critically important to turning the page on another year that most people never do. It's a simple ritual we call \"Closing the Books.\" And, the problem with skipping this step is that, if you don't do it, you never fully let go of this year and create the space to step into next year as unburdened by the past as you can possibly be.
