  "description": "<p>In 1999 Bo and his father were hunting in South Carolina. Bo said “I was in my tree stand and at first I thought it was a bear but it did not walk like a bear it walked like a man. Than I thought it must be a huge man in a ghillie suit. I watched him take his foot and scratch his calf just like a man would. When it saw me it took off so fast. I don’t even know how to describe it. It was like on a zipline. It was so smooth and fast.”</p> <p>Here is the link for <a href=\"https://www.phenomecon.net/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">Phenomecon</a>. The event is in September, stop by and say hi.</p> <p> </p>",
