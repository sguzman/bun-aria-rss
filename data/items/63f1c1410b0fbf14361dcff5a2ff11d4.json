  "description": "<p><a href=\"https://www.outsideonline.com/1741411/tim-cahill\">Tim Cahill</a> is one of the best writers of his generation. His work is funny, surprising, and deep. I first read him back in the 80s, when I was a young dirtbag hitchhiking to Alaska in search of adventure and a disgusting job. (Found both.) He's inspired generations of writers, travelers, and humorists.</p> <p>Here's a link to Tim's conversation with <a href=\"https://www.kyle.surf/podcast/timcahill\">Kyle Thiermann</a>.</p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Find me on</span> <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/thatchrisryan/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Instagram</span></a> <span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">or</span> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/ThatChrisRyan\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Twitter</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></p> <p><a href=\"http://chrisryanphd.com/support\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Please consider supporting this podcast.</span></a></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/gp/site-directory/ref=as_at/?imprToken=L0dx1bytKTIFKxXSPyxqDw&slotNum=0&imprToken=9z4hfRiNxmPSo-xbL1UP9w&slotNum=23&&_encoding=UTF8&tag=seatda-20&linkCode=ur2&linkId=f16530c77f77aa7b0fbec39c58a049a1&camp=1789&creative=9325\"> This Amazon affiliate link kicks a few bucks back my way.</a></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Intro music: “Brightside of the Sun,” by <a href=\"https://basinandrange.bandcamp.com/track/brightside-of-the-sun\">Basin and Range,</a>\"Side of the Road,\" by <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/artist/3LSrMl5KKIJUcEWoCTYH8g?si=GclJYvTKTiax48yK1LCcOg\"> Jemma and the Good Thing</a>.</span></p> <br/><br/>This is a public episode.
