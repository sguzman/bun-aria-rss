  "description": "There's something in the forest in 16th century Scotland. It's been there for years. Anyone who sees it doesn't live to tell about it, and it moves seamlessly between land and sea, leaving nothing but body parts in its wake. With a body count in the thousands, it's a legendary historical horror story that's supposedly true. The creature is a goblin spider. It's a goblin who's also a spider...or, is it? We'll see that things aren't always what they seem on an extended creature of the week. -- Sponsors: Simplisafe home security is my absolute favorite. They're easy to set up, no hidden fees, and for just $15/month you can protect just about everything in your home. Check them out at https://simplisafe.com/legends and you'll get free shipping and a 60-day risk-free trial. Check out the awesome new mobile game, Best Fiends, on the Apple App Store or Google Play! -- Music: “An Accumulation” by Blue Dot Sessions “Emmit Sprak” by Blue Dot Sessions “Cicle Veroni” by Blue Dot Sessions<p><a href=\"https://www.mythpodcast.com/membership\" rel=\"payment\">Support the show: https://www.mythpodcast.com/membership</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
