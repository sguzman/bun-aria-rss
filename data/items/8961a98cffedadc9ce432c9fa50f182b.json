Only 4 World Cup wins now separate Lindsey from the record set by Ingemar Stenmark in 1989.</p><p>Eclipsing this once thought untouchable achievement is the final goal propelling Lindsey into her final professional season.</p><p>Off the slopes, Lindsey is a media mogul. A regular on “Most Marketable” athlete lists, she has been profiled in every major media outlet across the globe and graced the cover of publications such as Fitness, Sports Illustrated, ESPN, TV Guide and many others.</p><p>Not enough?

Less appreciated are the countless obstacles she has faced and overcome over the course of her legendary career.
