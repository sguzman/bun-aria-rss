  "description": "We are in the middle of an economic sea-change in the United States. The prevailing views of the past 40 years--call them Reaganomics or neo-liberalism or the Washington Consensus--are being pushed aside. The inequality they left in their wake are being addressed by new policies that focus on investing in the middle class and the most vulnerable. The leader of this revolution is not some young firebrand but a seasoned figure of the Washington establishment, President Joe Biden. We discuss his bold economic vision and its potential consequences with Ed Luce and Rana Foroohar of the Financial Times. It's a great, provocative discussion. Don' miss it.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
