  "description": "In this episode,  we talk with Jen Dolan, Director of Sales for residential and retail at Arteriors. Jen tells about where Arteriors started, how far they've come in design and how they have moved into all aspects of interior design development, including furniture, accent furniture, upholstered seating, wall decor mirrors, lighting, and accessories, so that people can come in and decorate basically a whole room through Arteriorswe.  She tells us about some of the new projects Arteriors is working on and what has inspired those. She lets us in on what she is seeing coming up with a lot of raw & natural textures, organics juxtaposed with hard surfaces like metals, stone, and glass mixed with geometric shapes. We discuss outdated trends and how you can make almost anything fit into your space if you really love it and making it your own. Jen talks a little about fashion and what she wears and takes with her being reflection of the journey you have been on and the places you have visited.  Jen wisely tells us, \"\"As long as you love something and are true to who you are, it will never be dated.<br /><br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/arteriorshome/\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/arteriorshome/</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/ArteriorsHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.facebook.com/ArteriorsHome</a><br /><a href=\"https://twitter.com/ArteriorsHome\" rel=\"noopener\">https://twitter.com/ArteriorsHome</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.pinterest.com/arteriorshome/\" rel=\"noopener\">http://www.pinterest.com/arteriorshome/</a><br /><br />What Arteriors is doing 1:33<br />How Arteriors started out 9:09<br />How long can you live with a trend before it starts looking out of date? 11:43<br />One of Jen’s favorite projects they’ve worked on 23:59<br />What’s next and what Jen is looking for 30:22<br /><br />“When you work in a neutral palette, so grays and creams, and beautiful charcoals and sleights, you ensure that you can incorporate that perennially.
