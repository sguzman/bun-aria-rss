  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, the New York State Attorney General's independent investigation found that Gov. Andrew Cuomo sexually harassed women who are both current and former state employees. NY AG Letitia James reported that Cuomo violated both federal and state laws yet she did not announce any charges against him for groping or any other charge. Why not? What kind of Attorney General's office is this? Where is the US Attorney if there were violations of federal law? Then, Rep. Lee Zeldin, a candidate for governor in New York, calls in to comment on Cuomo's fiasco and the punting of responsibility by AG James. Zeldin questioned whether or not Cuomo would be held accountable for anything else he's done, including his deadly mishandling of nursing homes during the height of the pandemic. Later, all citizens that get COVID because the federal government brought the disease to you through a COVID positive migrant or to your neighborhood or school district you must determine causation and sue them. It's a violation of one's civil rights when the government doesn't do its job and it's time we flood the system with their own mess. Meanwhile, Tamyra Mensa-Stock won the gold medal for Team USA in wrestling at the Tokyo games. She is the first African-American woman to achieve this honor and she couldn't be prouder to compete on behalf of her country. Afterward, Ben Shapiro, calls in to discuss his new book, \"The Authoritarian Moment: How the left Weaponized America's Institutions Against Dissent.\"\nLearn more about your ad choices.
