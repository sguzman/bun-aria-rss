  "description": "Conventional wisdom says Bloomberg was the debate's biggest loser. I think he was only the second biggest. The real loser was Bernie Sanders, who is such a weak and vulnerable candidate that even Bloomberg landed a shot on him. Also, if \"consent\" is all that matters then what exactly is wrong with incest and polygamy? And AOC says billionaires shouldn't exist. Shouldn't we be creeped out to hear agents of the state say that certain types of people shouldn't exist?\n\nCheck out The Cold War: What We Saw, a new podcast written and presented by Bill Whittle at https://www.dailywire.com/coldwar. In Part 1 we peel back the layers of mystery cloaking the Terror state run by the Kremlin, and watch as America takes its first small steps onto the stage of world leadership.\n\nIf you like The Matt Walsh Show, become a member TODAY with promo code: WALSH and enjoy the exclusive benefits for 10% off at https://www.dailywire.com/Walsh\nLearn more about your ad choices.
