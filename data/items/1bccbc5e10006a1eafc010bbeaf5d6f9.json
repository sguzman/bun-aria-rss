  "description": "On Monday’s Mark Levin show, why shouldn’t we believe Brett Kavanaugh’s denials? Why should we believe his accusers? It’s Kavanaugh who acceded to six FBI background checks. It’s Kavanaugh who had a high-profile position in the Bush White House. His accussers don’t have a single witness to any of these accusations. And only now, when he’s an inch away from being confirmed to the United States Supreme Court — when we’re 42 days away from the midterm elections — the same people who want President Trump’s head on a stake now want Kavanaugh’s head on a stake. Also, the latest accuser, Deborah Ramirez, who was recently sought after by the Democrats claims she didn't remember much, but after six days with lawyers, she's now remembering plenty. Now, Christine Ford, claims she doesn't remember much either, but is sure about Kavanaugh. However, other accusers like Paula Jones, Kathleen Willey, and Juanita Broaddrick all had details and reported the assault by president Clinton soon after it happened, yet were never taken seriously. Then, it’s time to get angry, because the Supreme Court and Senate doesn’t belong to Move On org, or NARAL; they belong to us! This isn't a game, this is real life - our lives, our Constitution, our Country! The Supreme Court has too much power and too few justices that enforce the Constitution and that is why they are panicking over confirming a Constitutionalist! Afterwards, CNN’s Brian Stelter actually has the audacity to attack Mark for fake news. He attacked Mark as a smear machine against Christine Ford but he is the one who has a long history of hackish, sleazy behavior.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
