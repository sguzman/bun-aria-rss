  "description": "Adam and Dr. Drew open the show discussing the 'stepping down' of Jeff Zucker from CNN and what the reality of that story might be as opposed to the narrative that CNN itself is painting. They also discuss the impending Super Bowl being hosted at SoFi Stadium in Los Angeles and the mask mandate coming with it, as they try to explore what other stadiums have similar mandates in place. They then turn to the phones and speak with a caller who wants to discuss and expand upon Adam's 'death of math' theory. They also talk to a caller who recently experienced a heightened level of wokeness he wants to discuss.\n\nPlease Support Our Sponsors:\nSimpliSafe.com/ADAM2\n1800Flowers.com, code ADS\nSugarBreak.com/ADS, code ADS\nGeico.com",
