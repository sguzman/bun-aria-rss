  "description": "<p>Introducing <em>Not Lost,</em> the latest show in the Pushkin podcast slate. It&rsquo;s hosted by Brendan Francis Newnam, long-time host of the radio show <em>Dinner Party Download</em>, who&rsquo;s now the force behind many of Pushkin&rsquo;s audiobook originals. <em>Not Lost</em> is a travel show about finding yourself in places you&rsquo;ve never been. A few years back, Brendan was a bit lost himself &ndash; his radio show and relationship ended simultaneously. So he hit the road, always with a friend, and ventured out to new cities. <em>Not Lost</em> takes us from Montreal to Mexico City, as Brendan and crew seek the essence of the place, while angling for an invitation to a stranger&rsquo;s house for dinner.
