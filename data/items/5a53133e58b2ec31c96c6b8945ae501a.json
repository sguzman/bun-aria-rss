  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the head of the LA teachers union admits that she doesn’t care about kids learning academic subjects. She just wants them to be properly indoctrinated. She may be the one saying it out loud, but this is how the public school system has operated for decades. Also, the CDC has expanded its interests beyond infectious diseases and is now fighting the scourge of gun violence. And can you now lose custody of your kids if you aren’t vaccinated? Things seem to be trending that way. Plus in our Daily Cancellation, a firefighter in Virginia is under investigation for making an allegedly racist movement with his fingers. The story only gets more insane from there. We’ll talk about that and much more today on the Matt Walsh Show. \nSubscribe to Morning Wire, Daily Wire’s new morning news podcast, and get the facts first on the news you need to know: https://utm.io/udyIF\nLearn more about your ad choices.
