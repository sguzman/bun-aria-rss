  "description": "<p>Todd Mullis calls 911 as he drives his wife to an Iowa hospital. Amy Mullis was found by the couple's 13-year-old son, impaled on a corn rake and does not survive her injuries. An autopsy is completed and the forensic pathologist finds not four puncture wounds in Mullis' back, but six. The corn rake Todd Mullis says his wife fell on, only has four tines. Also, while Mullis told police he had a good relationship with his wife, investigators learn that Amy was apparently unhappy in the marriage and had at least two affairs. She reportedly told a friend that if Mullis caught her he would “throw her to the pigs.” Court documents showed Amy Mullis called a friend petrified and screaming that Todd Mullis had found out about her affair. Todd Mullis is arrested and convicted of killing his wife.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
