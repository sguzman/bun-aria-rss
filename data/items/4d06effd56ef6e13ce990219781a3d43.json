  "description": "Gary talks to Adam about how his Tesla keeps the cabin temperature from rising to dangerous levels and Adam wonders why this isn’t a feature in every car. Rob Schneider calls in from the road to talk about how his wife won’t let his daughters watch any of his older work, so he had to make a new movie: ‘Daddy Daughter Trip’. Adam tells Rob about the time he was ghosted by John Cleese and the two rant about the education failures in California. Comedian Steven Ho comes into the studio to talk about his journey going from an ER technician to a TikTok star with over 10 million followers. Steven tells the story of how offended users on TikTok tracked him down to the California hospital he worked at and tried to get him fired. He talks about teaching improv at a prison and how he was told not to fall in love with the inmates. \n\nTHANKS FOR SUPPORTING TODAY’S SPONSORS:\n\nGeico.com\n\nEtsy.com enter HELLO10\n\nCon-Cret.com/PODCAST\n\nApartments.com\n\nThe Jordan Harbinger Show",
