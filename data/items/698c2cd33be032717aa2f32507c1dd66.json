  "description": "You&rsquo;re a hotshot manager. You love your dashboards and you keep your finger on the beating pulse of the business. You take pride in using data to drive your decisions rather than shooting from the hip like one of those old-school 1950s bosses. This is the 21st century, and data is king.

Never mind, you can proudly tell all your friends that you are leading a modern data-driven team."
