  "description": "On Friday’s Mark Levin Show, Benjamin Netanyahu is dealing with the same type of ultra-left-wing media attacks in Israel as President Trump is in America. Now, the Israeli media is launching a pre-emptive attack on Netanyahu before his interview with Mark which airs on Sunday on Fox News. The media in Israel is full of leftist, pro-socialist appeasers. Also, we now know that the Obama administration affirmatively refused to stop the Russian cyberattacks during the 2016 election. Susan Rice told Michael Daniel, White House director of cybersecurity, to cease and desist efforts to fight back on Russian hacking. Rice told Daniel and his team to stand down so they didn’t box in Obama; if they gave him options he’d have to act. Obama didn’t want to do anything to stop the Russians because he was sure Hillary Clinton would be elected and didn’t want anyone to say the election was fraudulent. Obama let Russian cyberattacks slide because in the end he was all about power, not integrity, and is now at the center of this monumental scandal. Later, Trump deserves great credit for how he’s handled North Korea, not the vicious attacks he’s getting from the media. Through wise use of our military, economic sanctions, and the international community, Trump has put enough pressure on Kim Jong-un to bring him to the table.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
