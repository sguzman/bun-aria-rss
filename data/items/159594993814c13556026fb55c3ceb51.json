We turn over every rock and speak about how the band got hooked up with Epitaph Records, this being his “last” chance to make it in music, intimacy at shows and the secret behind being in a band (spoiler alert: hustle). Frankly, this was a nice and relaxing chat that I didn’t expect to have with Kevin but I am sure glad I did. Enjoy!
