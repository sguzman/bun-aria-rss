  "description": "This week, the gals get a little graphic talking about what happens when bodies are kept stashed in a house. Topics include the stages of decomposition, a sleepy strangler, respectful squatters, and some hoarders (naturally). Grab a bottle of Winc Wine Club's Funk Zone White Blend, clean out your guest bedroom, consider a bog burial, and settle in for Episode 34: Stashed Bods.",
