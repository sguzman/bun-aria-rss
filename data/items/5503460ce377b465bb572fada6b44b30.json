  "description": "<div>Hi Friends!<br>\nHope you are having a wonderful day today so far. Today I wanted to talk about Theodore Kaczynski and his very smart brain but awful things he did. <br>\n Now I said a couple of times that I agreed with him on some points, but I forgot to say, hey man, I don’t agree with all the things he said. I started to skim parts of it and now I’m worried there’s some awful nonsense in there that now sounds like me saying “YA I AGREE!” haha.. im just agreeing with his thoughts on technology taking over society, blah blah.. you get it , I hope. <br>\nLove and appreciate you guys so much and I hope to be seeing you very soon<br>\nxo<br>\nBailey Sarian <br>\n<br>\nP.S.
