  "description": "<p>With Aleena's vanity falling off the wall and her attitude coming in full force today, we provide our thoughts on this new season of the Real Housewives of Beverly Hills, from our honest overview of Erika Jayne's recent problematic behaviour (hitting on Garcelle's eldest son to making inappropriate comments to someone with an eating disorder), Sutton Stracke's lack of emotional intelligence, Garcelle Beauvais' pot stirring and Diana Jenkin's nouveau riche tackiness.</p><br><p>Not only are we getting spicy with this week's commentary, we talk about how some of these women are cougars and go deep into the societal concept of the cougar (which many of our housewives have been seen as), including the definition, what the data tells us, and the potential sociological and biological reasons for the \"phenomenon\". In summary, can't a girl just get some good d**k and call it a day?</p><br><p>Join us this week as we blow your minds around the reality of \"cougars\" and come to the realization that we're nearing cougar age ourselves.
