  "description": "In this episode I address the breaking news about the early morning raid of political operative Roger Stone’s house by the Mueller team. Mueller is clearly panicking at this point and I make the case that he is getting desperate by using these tactics. I also cover the increasingly troubling use of technology by governments to spy on citizens. \nNews Picks:\nBob Mueller’s team grabs Roger Stone and still produces no evidence of collusion. \n \nNancy Pelosi admits she’s not serious about reopening the government.\n \nUS jobless claims fall to a 49 year low. \n \nSome lawmakers believe only a crisis will end the government shutdown.\n \nNancy Pelosi is boxed in a corner by Trump’s latest offer. \n \nThe Democrat presidential candidates are trying to outdo each other on tax hike proposals. \n \nThis piece addresses the Clinton campaign’s role in the framing of the Trump team.\n \nCopyright Dan Bongino All Rights Reserved.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
