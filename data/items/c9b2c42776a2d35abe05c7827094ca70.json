Suspended with rope from a vaulted ceiling on Folsom Street Fair Eve, scientist and storyteller Lesley Jones yawns and fears she’s gotten too jaded for kink. Yet as she hangs there, she remembers the body issues she encountered at her first Leather event, and all the personal growth she’s gained from her years of submission. #BodyConfidence #PowerExchange #Humiliation #Flogger #HotTopic</strong></p> <p class=\"p2\"> </p> <p class=\"p1\"><strong><em>About the storyteller:</em></strong></p> <p class=\"p2\"> </p> <p class=\"p3\"><strong>Lesley Jones is a scientist, burner, hedonist and storyteller based in Seattle.

She has performed with Bawdy Storytelling, RISK!, The Moth, The Mystery Box, and was featured on Dan Savage's Hot Mic podcast.
