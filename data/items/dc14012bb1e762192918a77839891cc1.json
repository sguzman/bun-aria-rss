  "description": "<p>Thirty years in the making, this episode of HOW DID WE GET WEIRD? sees Jonah and Vanessa catching up with their long-lost cousin and the former host of the MTV's Headbangers Ball, Riki Rachtman. We discuss how Riki is related through marriage to the Bayers, the time Jonah almost invited Riki to his Bar Mitzvah and the time Axl Rose flew to New York with Riki to get our cousin his first hosting job on MTV. We also talk about our first bands, what it was like owning the Sunset Strip's most infamous club and why Alice Cooper was the first person to know about Riki's engagement. Vanessa also laments the loss of the old-school answering machine, Jonah reminisces about music video culture and Riki remembers a time when having tattoos made you an outcast. There truly is something for everyone on this episode... unless you're a Caribou Coffee enthusiast.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
