  "title": "Tuesday Night Football Preview: Bills-Titans Gambling Picks, Props & DFS Advice (Football 10/13)",
  "description": "There's no such thing as a normal week in 2020 and that most definitely applies to the NFL. Thursday Night Football is scrapped this week but we do get Tuesday Night Football and Will Brinson and Jordan Dajani are here to break down Bills-Titans from a gambling perspective. The guys go over how the COVID-19 list could impact this game as well as addressing what the time off for Tennessee could mean. We had high hopes for both units, but is either team actually good on defense? Derrick Henry's rushing total is super high, but Jordan still wants to back the over. Meanwhile, Brinson is banking on an anytime touchdown (or even first TD) from Anthony Firkser.
