  "description": "<p>On today’s show, Pat is joined by NBC Sports NHL analyst, a guy who knows just about everything about every hockey player on earth, Pierre McGuire. Pat and Pierre chat about the path to hockey coming back, what he has heard about the playoff format, what road blocks still stand in the way, his thoughts on what the two potential hub cities could be, and who the greatest hockey player of all-time is (4:05-15:15). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk where Pat and AJ discuss the NHL coming back, the MLB season looking less likely with each passing day, the allure of certain sports having no fans in the stands, and everything else that is going on in the sports world (15:17-1:35:35). Later, former General Manager of the Cleveland Browns and front office associate of the New England Patriots, 3x Super Bowl Champion, Michael Lombardi. Pat and Michael chat about the proposed 4th and 15 rule getting rid of the onside kick and why Lombardi is not a fan of it, he gives some more insight on what GM’s do when they learn that a player may be available, Michael retells the story of trading Trent Richardson to the Colts and how the deal was completed, and gives his take on everything else that is happening around the NFL (1:38:20-1:57:30). Lastly, former USC Quarterback, 5th overall pick of the New York Jets in the 2009 NFL Draft, and friend of the show, Mark Sanchez joins the program. Pat and Mark discuss the NCAA name and likeness rule changing and how he thinks that will play out in a city like Los Angeles with players at USC, what it takes for a rookie Quarterback to be successful in the NFL, where Mark thinks Cam Newton will end up and why he doesn’t have a job already, the development of Josh Allen and why he thinks it is a huge year for him, and what Mark has been doing to survive quarantine (1:59:42-2:17:10). Don’t forget to send in the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat with a picture of where you’re listening to the show for the chance to win some free merch. We appreciate you listening. Come and laugh with us, cheers.</p>\n",
