  "description": "Adam and Dr. Drew open the show with a topic from the very end of the last show, the newfound ability of Twitter being able to silence a fake news shit storm that starts on TV. They then turn to the phones and speak with a caller who wants their thoughts on the trial of Kyle Rittenhouse and what they see as the likely outcome of that trial. They also speak to a caller with a question about the J&J vaccine and if a booster is warranted at the moment. Next Drew recounts his trip to New Orleans where he hung out with Joe Rogan, Jeff Ross, Dave Chappelle and many more. Drew reveals that he has been invited on The Joe Rogan Experience and gives some insights on his interactions with Dave Chappelle.\n\nPlease Support Our Sponsors:\nCandidCO.com/ADS enter ADS\nJoinFightCamp.com/ADS\nLifelock.com, promo code ADAM\nFor PaintYourLife text ADS to 64-000",
