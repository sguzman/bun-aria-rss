  "description": "In this episode we discuss from where we draw our inspiration and how we inspire  our own ideas and styles. Sue tells us what her inspiration is and why you shouldn't get rid of everything that is “out of style.” She suggests using Pinterest to find inspiration, and if you're kind of tired of the things you're seeing on there, follow someone else.  Look for new designers until you find something that gives you that spark of interest. A question you can ask yourself is “What do I want this to feel like?” And you can make it feel like your honeymoon, using photos that captured a moment in your past that you can draw inspiration from. We want an emotional response invoked through all your senses that sparks and opens your imagination to ideas that resonate. Make your decisions emotional because these experiences will last your whole life and won't go out of style. It needs to be something that makes you happy when you look at it. <br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/unapologeticdopeness/?hl=en\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/unapologeticdopeness/?hl=en</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/theclaymaven/?hl=en\" rel=\"noopener\">https://www.instagram.com/theclaymaven/?hl=en</a><br /><br /><a href=\"https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5\" rel=\"noopener\">https://manage.kmail-lists.com/subscriptions/subscribe?a=HZENWY&g=PFcqV5</a><br /><br />Sue’s inspiration 4:27<br />Drawing inspiration from photos or memories 9:15<br />When we designed with tiger oak for the first time 13:22<br />Something our friend does for inspiration 18:21<br /><br />“You can do anything.
