In 2015 Kaki launched \"The Neck is a Bridge to the Body,\" a groundbreaking multi-media performance integrating guitar and projected imagery synced to the music. What's even more incredible, Kaki King never intended for music to be her career. Her early years were spent playing in bands as a drummer, just for fun. And, her \"big break\" came in a way she never saw coming, or even tried to make happen. And, as with all of our Music in May episodes, be sure to stay until the end to hear Kaki perform live in-studio.</p><p>-------------</p><p>Have you discovered your&nbsp;Sparketype&nbsp;yet?&nbsp;Take the Sparketype Assessment™ now.
