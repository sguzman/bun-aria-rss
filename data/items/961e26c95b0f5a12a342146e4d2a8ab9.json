  "description": "<p>What’s the best way to grow old? Are we over-parenting our kids? And how can I strike the right work-life balance?</p><p>These are just a few of the questions&nbsp;<strong>Ravi Patel</strong>&nbsp;was struggling with. So the actor, filmmaker, husband and dad decided to explore how foreign cultures grapple with them. The result is&nbsp;<em>Ravi Patel’s Pursuit of Happiness,&nbsp;</em>a docu-series in which Ravi enlists his friends and family in overseas adventures in search of answers to life’s questions.</p><p>Perhaps you caught Ravi’s 2014 hit documentary&nbsp;<em>Meet The Patels,</em>&nbsp;a funny and touching first-person family adventure in which Ravi enlists his traditional Indian parents in his search for love, leading him down a rabbit hole into the world of arranged marriages.</p><p>Streaming on HBO Max, the new show digs even deeper —&nbsp;a poignant and timely deconstruction of American exceptionalism that ventures beyond&nbsp;buddy travelogue tropes.</p><p>Today Ravi shares his story — and the many lessons learned along the way.</p><p>Hardly your ordinary actor, this conversation begins with an exploration of Ravi’s unique path. His past life in investment banking. His current interest in health and wellness. His grapple with identity and indoctrination. And his sundry adventures navigating the vicissitudes of Hollywood.</p><p>We then pivot to the many nuggets of wisdom Ravi has gleaned from his personal journey. And we tug on the questions explored in his&nbsp;<em>Pursuit of Happiness</em>&nbsp;travels to Japan, Denmark, South Korea and Mexico:</p><p><em>Why are Americans so unhappy?&nbsp;How can you be a good parent?&nbsp;How do&nbsp;you find work life balance? And how can we responsibly promote inclusion for all?</em></p><p>Recorded pre-election, this conversation is equal parts light-hearted and profound — a mix of laughs and uppercase Truths on all things love, partnership, parenting, purpose, and passion.</p><p>It’s also a friendship origin story. The first of what I anticipate will be more conversations to come.</p><p>The visually inclined can watch our exchange on<a href=\"https://youtu.be/RY39wdvwJnU\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">&nbsp;YouTube.</a>&nbsp;And as always, the podcast streams wild and free on&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bit.ly/rrpitunes\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Podcasts</a>&nbsp;and&nbsp;<a href=\"https://bit.ly/rrpspotify\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Spotify.</a></p><p>I love this guy and everything he’s about.
