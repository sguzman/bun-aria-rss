  "itunes:summary": "The New Discourses Podcast with James Lindsay, Episode 17\nRepressive Tolerance Series, Part 1 of 4\n\nWe live in a crazy world today that seems to have gone off the rails.  That's because it is being driven by a broken logic, and, for all the  flaws on the right, that broken logic is centered in the  no-longer-tolerant left. The logic of the left today is overwhelmingly  rooted in a single essay published in 1965 by the neo-Marxist  philosopher Herbert Marcuse. That essay is \"Repressive Tolerance.\" The  thesis statement of this essay can be boiled down to \"movements from the  left must be extended tolerance, even when they are violent, while  movements from the right must not be tolerated, including suppressing  them by violence.\" This asymmetric ethic has been the heart and soul of  left politics in the West since the 1960s, and we're living in the fruit  of that catastrophe now.\n\nTo help people understand this vitally important and intrinsically  totalitarian essay and its relevance to our present moment, James Lindsay walks the listener through Marcuse's \"Repressive Tolerance\" in a  four-part lecture series. In this series, he reads the essay in full  and attempts to make clear how it is the logic underlying the present  moment. The goal is to explain the essay as Marcuse would have  understood it, in his own context, and to show how his own logic has  become dominant and the monster that he believed he was fighting.\n\nIn the first part, Lindsay begins by framing the Frankfurt School of  Critical Theory to give background on Marcuse. He also explains that  Marcuse seems to be attempting to give a solution to Karl Popper's  famous \"Paradox of Tolerance,\" which was provided as an aside in his  1945 book The Open Society and Its Enemies, which analyzed how fascism  can arise and overtake liberal societies. Marcuse's answer to this  conundrum is that a \"discriminating tolerance,\" a \"liberating  tolerance,\" must be practiced that offers favoritism to the left and  actively suppresses the right, as he defines them (from a perspective of  Critical Theory). Join Lindsay as he contextualizes and then brings the  first portion of this essay to life, and stay tuned for Parts 2, 3, and  4 to come!\n\nSupport New Discourses:\npaypal.me/newdiscourses\npatreon.com/newdiscourses\nsubscribestar.com/newdiscourses\nyoutube.com/channel/UC9K5PLkj0N_b9JTPdSRwPkg/join\n\nWebsite:\nnewdiscourses.com\n\nFollow:\nfacebook.com/newdiscourses\ntwitter.com/NewDiscourses\ninstagram.com/newdiscourses\npinterest.com/newdiscourses/\nlinkedin.com/company/newdiscourses\nminds.com/newdiscourses\nreddit.com/r/NewDiscourses\n\nPodcast:\n@newdiscourses\npodcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/new-…es/id1499880546\nbit.ly/NDGooglePodcasts\nopen.spotify.com/show/0HfzDaXI5L4LnJQStFWgZp\nstitcher.com/podcast/new-discourses\n\n© 2021 New Discourses.
