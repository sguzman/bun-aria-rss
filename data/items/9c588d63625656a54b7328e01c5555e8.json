Stress can also come in the form of bad food and poor or inadequate sleep, which send negative signals to the brain that produce stress hormones. That doesn’t mean we’re stuck with stress though. Today on The Doctor’s Farmacy, I’m joined by my good friend Dr. Rangan Chatterjee to look at the many sides of stress and all the actions we can take to stop it in its tracks.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Dr. Chatterjee is regarded as one of the most influential doctors in the UK and wants to change how medicine will be practiced for years to come.
