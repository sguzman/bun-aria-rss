  "description": "CALLmeKAT is the recording moniker of Katrine Ottosen, a singer and musician from Copenhagen, Denmark with a lovely, delicate voice backed by electronics. Austin is noisy during SXSW and Ottosen's subtle and beautiful voice could easily be buried by the distorted din of bands playing in venues along the streets. But luckily we found an intimate, quiet room at the Driskell Hotel, an historic hotel in downtown Austin for Ottosen to perform her song \"Bug In A Web\"",
