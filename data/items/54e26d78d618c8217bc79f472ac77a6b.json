  "description": "Today’s show is loaded with everything you need to know following a massive weekend in the NFL. First, Pat welcomes 3x Pro Bowler, 2x All-Pro, one of the most freakish athletes to ever walk the face of the earth, friend of the show, LaVar Arrington. LaVar discusses his thoughts on Dwayne Haskins, if he sees progress in his game this year, and whether or not he thinks the Redskins will ever be a good football team. LaVar and Pat also chat about the Patriots and why he’s not ready to throw the towel in on them just yet, despite another mediocre performance this past week, and LaVar explains how he would attack defending Lamar Jackson (3:23-16:39). Pat and the boys also cover whether or not it’s time for the Patriots to panic, and why despite all the issues surrounding them, they’re still not a team people want to see in the playoffs. They discuss whether or not they think the Packers have a legitimate shot to make a deep playoff run, how tough the NFC looks this year, they take some time to gush about how incredible of a football player George Kittle is and why this 49ers team is humming right now, break down the AFC playoff picture and give some love to the scorching hot Tennessee Titans. Pat also reacts to the news that Adam Vinatieri will be having season ending knee surgery and how that has impacted his game this entire year. Plus, Digs calls in to chat about the Steelers’ big win over the weekend and why he thinks Duck Hodges is the best quarterback in the NFL and where he see’s the Steelers at as the playoffs are right around the corner. To close out the show, Pat chats about his first experience at an SEC game, and why it just matters more down there. He also gives his thoughts on the CFP finalists, why he thinks Joe Burrow is so good and why he’ll make all the monies in the NFL. Today’s a good one. Come and laugh with us, cheers.\n",
