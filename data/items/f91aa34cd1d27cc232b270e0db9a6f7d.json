  "description": "<p>On Episode 40 of Spittin' Chiclets, Florida Panthers defenseman Keith Yandle makes his long-anticipated debut and he doesn't disappoint. The witty Milton, MA native talks about his early days as a skateboarder, the differences playing for a league-owned team vs. an Original Six team (hint: one is BYOBreakfast, the other isn't), what fancy stats mean to him, why he played juniors in Canada instead of going the college route, and a lot more. Yandle's former teammate Paul Bissonnette (aka Bizzy) calls in to bust balls and reminisce about the Coyotes run to the 2012 Western Conference Finals before the fellas answer #AllRightHamilton questions.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
