  "description": "<p>Recently, I was invited onto a podcast called Ageless, which is hosted by fashion designer Cynthia Raleigh, and her daughter, Kit Keenan.</p> <p>Now, I have to say, I was charmed by the rapport between them. It was quite lovely. And I got caught up in their down to earth dynamic, which admittedly, was not what I expected.</p> <p>You see, Cynthia Raleigh has been a staple in the fashion world for decades. And Kit has been in the public eye since she was a kid growing up in the gleaming lights of New York City. So if we were to go by the articles and the gossip columns, it almost appears one dimensional. But there is nothing one dimensional about this mother and daughter duo whose love for one another and drive to grow is awe inspiring. </p>",
