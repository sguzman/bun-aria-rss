Join your host Brett Goldstein as he and his guest go deep into the subject of mortality via cinema, and this week he is joined LIVE (at the time) at the Brighton Podcast Festival by ASIM CHAUDHRY of the hit show ‘People Just Do Nothing’!</p><br><p>Pure hilarity and insight from start to end, as the two hit the ground running and get down to serious film, comedy and television business… You’ll be party to the whole damn thing (mmm minus some ‘circle of trust’ elements, you understand!), including how they met on a David Hasselhoff-based project, the madness of Black Mirror: Bandersnatch (which he was on), the perils of success by way of loneliness, having married-up family-starting friends, love in an Uber-pool and a resulting show premise, Tupac, Terry the video shop guy (rest in peace to him and also his shop ‘Terry’s Visuals’), being shaken up by a truly mad experience in the woods, carefree days of going to a film school in the US and the insane passport drama that resulted, big screen headaches, Bollywood romance and the origins of People Just Do Nothing! ALSO - a killer Q&A with the awesome audience. Do get ever so involved!</p><br><p>•&nbsp;NOTE! So as you can hear, this was recorded live. At the live shows, there are always visuals pertaining to the films mentioned, so bear in mind that on occasion here the film was brought up when Brett was asking the question. Hence the speedy reaction.
