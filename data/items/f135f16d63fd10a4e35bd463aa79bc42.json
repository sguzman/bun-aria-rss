  "description": "<p>Born in a small town in Japan to a family of doctors, artist and textile designer <strong>Kazumi Yoshida</strong> was always something of a free spirit. He made his way to London as a young man, then New York, where he met Robin Roberts, the extravagant, larger-than-life founder of Clarence House. The two were a match made in heaven, and Kazumi’s creations saw the company reach new heights. Edgy, artistic, colorful and opulent—for a time Clarence House was the fabric brand you simply couldn’t ignore.  </p><p>Roberts passed away in the early 2000s, and Clarence House went through a quiet period. But now it has a new owner and Kazumi is once again working on new designs as artistic director. On this episode of podcast. He tells host Dennis Scully some incredible stories from Clarence House’s heyday, and explains why he’s optimistic that the brand is entering an exciting new chapter.  </p><p>This episode is sponsored by <a href=\"https://www.serenaandlily.com/designer-circle/trade-lp.html\">Serena & Lily</a> and <a href=\"artistictile.com/boh\">Artistic Tile</a>.</p><p><i><strong>LINKS</strong></i><br /><a href=\"https://clarencehouse.com/\">Clarence House</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.kazumiyoshida.com/index.php\">Kazumi Yoshida</a><br /><a href=\"https://clarencehouse.com/fabric/1896702/madeline/tangerine\">Clarence House's Madeline Pattern</a><br /><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/dennisscully/\">Dennis Scully</a><br /><a href=\"http://www.businessofhome.com/\">Business of Home</a></p>\n",
