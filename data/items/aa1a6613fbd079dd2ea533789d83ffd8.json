  "description": "Pat and Stu fill in for Glenn on the 20th anniversary of the show.

Bill O’Reilly joins after a crazy week of Iran, congressional PR stunts, Trump Derangement Syndrome, and Ricky Gervais. Stu reads Glenn’s heartfelt message thanking his audience for such amazing support shown over the last two decades.
