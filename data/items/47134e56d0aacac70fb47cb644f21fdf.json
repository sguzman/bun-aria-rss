  "description": "In this episode we answer a follow up email to Faith and Doubt with questions like, \"How do I know the Bible is true?\" and \"I don't understand the Holy trinity...God, Jesus, and the Holy Spirit are ONE. I don't get it. So if I don't understand, than how can I say I am a believer?\".  We felt compelled by this and other notes in this email and wanted to share with you our thoughts.  If you have difficulty understanding what seems easy for others to understand about the Bible, you're not alone.  And that's totally ok.  Let's talk about it.\n\n- Mike Erre\n\nLearn more about the VOX Podcast:\nwww.voxpodcast.com\n\nSubscribe on iTunes - http://apple.co/1Lla1Nj\n\nFollow Mike on Twitter www.twitter.com/mikeerre\nLike Mike on Facebook www.facebook.com/officialmikeerre\n",
