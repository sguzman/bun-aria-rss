And now, one year later, Black Pumas are up for Album of the Year for the deluxe version of their debut. Guitarist/Producer Adrian Quesada and Singer Eric Burton met at a crossroads in both of their careers. Adrian left his first band, Grupo Fantasma after a successful run, including a years-long mentorship by Prince. While looking for a new direction, a friend suggested he work with Eric—changing both of their fortunes. In this episode, Adrian talks about being taken under Prince’s wing, Eric reminisces about writing the group’s biggest hit in church, and they explain their unique chemistry that’s led to instant success.<strong> </strong></p><p>Subscribe to Broken Record’s YouTube channel to hear old and new interviews, often with bonus content:<a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast\"> https://www.youtube.com/brokenrecordpodcast</a></p><p>You can also check out past episodes here:<a href=\"https://brokenrecordpodcast.com/\"> https://brokenrecordpodcast.com/</a></p><p>You can find some of our favorite Black Pumas songs <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/playlist/7Keyd8QO7FsKYbvsY0qZzL?si=subswT5nTpevYWTcMMVcjg\">HERE — enjoy!</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
