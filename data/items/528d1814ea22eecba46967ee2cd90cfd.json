I recently started living with him and I have a problem that I need your help with. My boyfriend loves to get a big bowl of ice cream most evenings as a treat after dinner. I try not to be overbearing because he could be drinking alcohol or have another bad habit, but his ice cream addiction is killing me slowly. You see my boyfriend is lactose intolerant, therefore, I cannot sleep peacefully in the bed with him at night..............<em></em></p><p></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
