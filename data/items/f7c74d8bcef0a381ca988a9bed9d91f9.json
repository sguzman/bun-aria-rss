  "description": "<p>Michael and Steve kick off season four by welcoming Federico Castelluccio (Furio Giunta). Federico talks about his incredible career as both an actor and a painter. How he got the role on the Sopranos, and how he originally read for the part of Johnny Sack. When he walked into the audition with an Italian accent, and said he was born in Naples but grew up in Patterson NJ, he was destined to play Furio. Federico shares a great story about his first day on set and the infamous brothel scene. The pressure was on and he knocked it out of the park…literately. </p><p>Then Michael and Steve talk about travel, places they’ve been and places they would love to go. Why is it no surprise that Steve is a terrible traveler…and Tony Sirico is even worse.</p><p>After that the guys break down the Soprano’s season four premiere. This is a crazy one and when it first aired the folks at Icelandair complained about the horrible way their stewardesses were being depicted…..but Quasimoto predicted all of this….
