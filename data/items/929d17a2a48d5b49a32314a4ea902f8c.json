It calms you, it makes you less triggered less often and when you’re triggered, you’re not triggered so intensely and you recover more quickly, that’s the calm, and it also focuses you. Meditation is a direct training of the mind in paying attention…” [17:39]   “Cognitive control is a stronger predictor of your adult life than your childhood IQ or the wealth of the family you grew up in.” [1:17:18]   “The first person who benefits from compassion is the one who feels it.” [1:34:29]   FOLLOW DANIEL: Website: danielgoleman.info Twitter: twitter.com/danielgolemanei Facebook: facebook.com/danielgoleman LinkedIn: linkedin.com/in/danielgoleman",
