Today is part 2 next, think of it as the other arm in our audio hug, wrapping us all in the arms of stories that remind us of our shared humanity at a time we need it most. So, sit back and enjoy these stories in part 2 of The Hug.&nbsp;</p><p>If you haven’t yet listened to <a href=\"https://www.goodlifeproject.com/podcast/the-hug-part-1/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Part 1 of The Hug</a> (https://tinyurl.com/y2f5y2eh), be sure to download it and listen now.

We all need stories that remind us of the good side of human beings, more than ever.
