  "title": "Bob Odenkirk & Peter Gould On The End Of 'Better Call Saul'",
  "description": "A great chapter in the history of TV is about to end. <em>Better Call Saul</em>, the prequel and spin-off to <em>Breaking Bad</em>, has only 4 episodes left. We talk with the show's star, Bob Odenkirk. In <em>Breaking Bad</em>, he was the sleazy, fast-talking lawyer Saul Goodman, known for his slip-and-fall cases and frivolous lawsuits. Secretly, he represented drug lords. In the prequel, we learn Saul's origin story. We'll also talk with Peter Gould, the writer who created the character Saul on <em>Breaking Bad</em>, and went on to co-create<em> Better Call Saul</em> and become the showrunner.  While filming <em>Better Call Saul</em>, one scene was interrupted for the worst imaginable reason: Odenkirk had a heart attack that was nearly fatal. He'll tell us about returning  to life–and to that scene. ",
