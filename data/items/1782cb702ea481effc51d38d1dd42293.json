    "media:description": "Ariana Grande - Positions Album (Official Live Performances) | Vevo\n\nIf our Official Live Performances of “pov,” “positions,” “safety net,” “my hair,” “34+35,” and “off the table” reveal anything, it’s that Ariana Grande excels at her job because she’s so passionate about the results. You don’t hit the high notes, you don’t exude candor, and you don’t make pop music as moving as she does without crossing the T’s and dotting the I’s. A very cool Cali session with the look and feel of a cozy little meadow was a perfect place to turn some of the best tunes on ‘Positions’ into utterly memorable performances. Now they’re all in one place. Just press play. \n\n00:00 - pov\n3:26 - positions\n7:44 - safety net\n11:10 - my hair & 34 +35\n17:20 - off the table\n\nThe Vevo official live performance of ‘Positions’ by Ariana Grande.
