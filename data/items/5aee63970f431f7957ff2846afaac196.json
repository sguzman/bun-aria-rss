  "description": "This week’s Bourbon Community Roundtable touches on lots of good hot topics. We look at MGP's stock as it continues it's downward trend with our thoughts on how this will play out for them. Then we talk about sourcing in general and if consumers are getting oversaturated with the same bulk market products. Stickers are always a fun subject, but this week there was one released that got national media attention. Will distilleries crack down on stickers? Lastly, we congratulate Old Forester on it’s revamp of the barrel program and cap it off with our most annoying bourbon terms.\nShow Notes:\n\nThis week’s Above the Char with Fred Minnick talks more about smoked grains.\n\nBreaking Bourbon announces Stagg Jr. as their whiskey of the year. Let's discuss.\n\nWhat do you think about the MPG losses for the 3rd quarter in a row?\n\nIs the bourbon market oversaturated with brands?\n\nWhat happens when the aged whiskey runs out?\n\nLet's discuss the effect of stickers on bottles.\n\nWhat do you think about the New Riff Pitino sticker?\n\nSticker predictions?\n\nBrown-Forman comes out with a barrel proof single barrel program for Old Forester. What is taking everyone else so long?\n\nWhat's the most annoying term in bourbon?",
