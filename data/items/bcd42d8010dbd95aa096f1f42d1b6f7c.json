  "description": "Adam and Dr. Drew open the show talking about the ongoing lockdowns in China and the insane notion that our initial response to Covid was to follow the exact policies of a communist nation. This leads to an animated rant from Adam about those who may have had the audacity to question portions of those mandates. They also discuss the impending drought restrictions and explore how it is a symptom of a much larger issue with our state government. They also speak to callers including one with questions about kratom, lockdown trauma, especially when it comes to those in recovery and much more.\n\nThank You For Supporting Our Sponsors:\nGoDRPower.com\nMoinkBox.com/ADS\nTommyJohn.com/ADS\nBlindsGalore.com let them know we sent you",
