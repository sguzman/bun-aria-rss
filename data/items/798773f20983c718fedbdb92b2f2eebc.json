  "description": "<p>Alix Burton aka Alix Goodenergy is the epitome of resilience. He started in the trucking industry in 2012 with no experience or mentor. He purchased a box truck and hit the ground running. After a year he shut his business down because his expenses became too much for him to keep up with. In 2015 he relaunched his business, this time he focused on 18 wheelers instead of box trucks. His past failure helped propel him to massive success. He now has a booming operation with 11 trucks on the road and monthly revenue totaling over $100,000. Along with running the trucking business Alix now teaches others how to become successful in the industry. He has partnered with Eric Thomas (The Hip Hop Preacher) to provide an educational platform for people interested in the business. #truckingindustry #milliondollarbusiness Good Energy Trucking Portal Link: http://www.goodenergyworldwide.com?afmc=1o EYL University: https://www.eyluniversity.com EYL University 40% off Annual Tuition Code: EARNERS Guest IG: @alix_goodenergy --- This episode is sponsored by · Anchor: The easiest way to make a podcast. <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/app\">https://anchor.fm/app</a> Support this podcast: <a href=\"https://anchor.fm/earnyourleisure/support\">https://anchor.fm/earnyourleisure/support</a></p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
