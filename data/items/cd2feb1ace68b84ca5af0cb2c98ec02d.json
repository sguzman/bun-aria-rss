  "description": "Kara and Scott talk about the stimulus package in limbo and the Defense Production Act. They break down how tech companies like Lyft, Airbnb and Tesla are pivoting in the COVID-19 crisis. They think Airbnb probably won’t go public this year. In Friend of Pivot, we talk to New York City Speaker Corey Johnson about how New York City is the US epicenter for COVID-19 cases. He discusses the possibility of rent freezes, the new “PAUSE” order and how small businesses are faring in the upheaval. In wins and fails, Kara thinks Rand Paul being the first Senator to test positive for COVID-19 — and exposing other congresspeople to the disease is a major fail.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
