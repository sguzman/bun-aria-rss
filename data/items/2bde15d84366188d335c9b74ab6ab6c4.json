  "description": "<p>Its Freaky Freaky Friday!! During \"Front Page News\" we discussed about a documentary on \"Robot Sex\" so we opened up the phone lines to if any of our listeners think getting freaky with a robot is considered cheating? Moreover, Cam'Ron mentioned that the reason why him and his girlfriend Juju broke up was because of social media, so we opened up the phone lines to hear stories about social media break ups. Also, Charlamagne gave \"Donkey of the Day\" to two people one for the guest for lighting up a crack pipe at a Thanksgiving dinner without asking, and for the host because she ended up killing her guest because he did ask and he did not even care to share with her. But what is most sad about this story is that they didn't even get to eat dinner. </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
