  "description": "So, there was this war with Iran, remember? Then there wasn't. Then there were cyberattacks. But what did they do? And were they legal? And why did we do them? And isn't all this making another war in the Middle East more likely--whether Trump wants it or not? We start our conversation on this issues with a first-rate panel featuring Sharon Weinberger of Yahoo News, Ed Luce of the FT, David Sanger of the NY Times and Ryan Goodman of Just Security. And from there it's off to the Dem debates, the misunderstood nature of \"red\" states and how the Supreme Court of the United States may just have delivered a real blow to democracy. You don't want to miss this stellar episode of Deep State Radio.\nThis episode of Deep State Radio is brought to you by Mova Globes.
