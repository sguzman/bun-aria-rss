Yet despite all these extreme circumstances Rusty Quill has managed to stand tall and we wanted to say thank you to everyone who has made this possible.</p><br><p>Here at Rusty Towers, we started the year hoping for convention appearances and maybe some international travel; instead, we pivoted to fully remote working to keep all your favourite shows ticking along safely and launched new online content like the Enthusigasm podcast and our Twitch live streams. Not only that, we have continued donating towards the Covid Relief Fund every month and with your additional help through Gaming and Giving we have raised more than £55,000 pounds to charity this year. That is astounding.</p><br><p>We are incredibly grateful to have such a skilled and dedicated team working with us and persevering through this year. But we never would have been able to make it anywhere near this far without the direct support of you, the listeners.&nbsp;</p><br><p>You’ve trusted us through thick and thin and thanks to you, we’ve managed to not only weather this year but even keep growing and start spinning up a load of new and exciting projects that you can look forward to in 2021. Your support has sustained the livelihoods of everyone here at Rusty Towers despite so much hardship and I know I speak for everyone here when I say that we will never forget your generosity and will continue to work to uphold the faith you show in us.</p><br><p>As always, we have special holiday content running throughout the festive period to help put a spring in your step and even have a complete music album for Stellar Firma fans being released to public from the 25th of December through to the New Year’s Eve.</p><br><p>We hope you and all your loved ones are happy and healthy this holiday. You are all amazing, truly amazing, and you all deserve the best new year possible.&nbsp;&nbsp;</p><br><p>Thank you so much, and happy holidays.&nbsp;</p><br><p>Join our community:</p><p>WEBSITE: <a href=\"http://www.rustyquill.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">rustyquill.com</a></p><p>FACEBOOK: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/therustyquill/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">facebook.com/therustyquill</a></p><p>TWITTER: @therustyquill</p><p>REDDIT: <a href=\"https://www.reddit.com/r/RustyQuill/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">reddit.com/r/RustyQuill</a></p><p>EMAIL: <a href=\"mailto:mail@rustyquill.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">mail@rustyquill.com</a></p> <a target='_blank' rel='noopener noreferrer' href=\"https://open.acast.com/public/patreon/fanSubscribe/817720\">Get bonus content on Patreon</a><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
