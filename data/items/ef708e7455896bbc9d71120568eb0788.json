  "description": "<p>Something major happened this week: A leaked draft opinion from the Supreme Court indicated the court will strike down <em>Roe</em> <em>versus Wade</em>. The landmark 1973 decision ruled that the Constitution protects a pregnant person&rsquo;s liberty to choose to have an abortion without excessive government restriction. While that protection has been chipped away almost relentlessly for decades, resulting in abortion access that is very much dependent on your zip code, the overturning of Roe could be the most consequential opinion in decades. On this episode of Next Question with Katie Couric, Katie talks with abortion law expert Mary Ziegler about the leak, the draft&rsquo;s damning language, and the impact of the conservative court on rights beyond abortion. Katie also takes the opportunity to tease an upcoming, in-depth and intimate series on abortion &mdash; something she has been working on for months in anticipation of the official ruling expected in late June.&nbsp;</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
