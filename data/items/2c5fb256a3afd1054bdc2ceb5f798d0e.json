  "description": "<p>We consider testing whether a set of Gaussian variables, selected from the\ndata, is independent of the remaining variables. We assume that this set is\nselected via a very simple approach that is commonly used across scientific\ndisciplines: we select a set of variables for which the correlation with all\nvariables outside the set falls below some threshold. Unlike other settings in\nselective inference, failure to account for the selection step leads, in this\nsetting, to excessively conservative (as opposed to anti-conservative) results.\nOur proposed test properly accounts for the fact that the set of variables is\nselected from the data, and thus is not overly conservative. To develop our\ntest, we condition on the event that the selection resulted in the set of\nvariables in question. To achieve computational tractability, we develop a new\ncharacterization of the conditioning event in terms of the canonical\ncorrelation between the groups of random variables. In simulation studies and\nin the analysis of gene co-expression networks, we show that our approach has\nmuch higher power than a ``naive'' approach that ignores the effect of\nselection.\n</p>",
