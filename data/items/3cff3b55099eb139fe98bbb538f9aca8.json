We no longer have to rely on galleries or agents - the internet allows us to connect directly with potential buyers. Sharing our creative process is a highly effective way to do this, and video can be a wonderful way to satisfy people’s interest.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>This week, we discuss different ways to get started with video, including how to create a video without appearing in it, how you can use Facebook “lives,” and why Instagram stories might be a good way to get started.</p>\n<p>We also acknowledge the vulnerability that comes with sharing our creative practice and get the giggles about some of the not-so-nice comments we have received. But we both agree that the benefits far outweigh the (extremely rare) mean remarks.
