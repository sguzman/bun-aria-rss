  "description": "<p><strong>This week, Connor and Dan are taking a trip through hyperspace just to deliver you an extra special sloppy Star Wars episode. Dan was on his way out the door to enjoy a vacation, so he decided to let Connor take the reins as they discuss Daoism, the Force of the Wills, and all the other philosophical influences on a series of movies they probably would have ended up taking about anyways. If you guys enjoy this type of episode (i.e. pop culture focused) let them know and maybe they'll do more!</strong></p>",
