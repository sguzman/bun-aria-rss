  "description": "On The Gist, we examine a historically very loose measure—the poverty line. When we hear about the “supplemental poverty measure” in the news, is that a more valuable number? We ask our regular guest Adam Davidson to explain. He’s a contributor to the New York Times Magazine and a founder of NPR’s Planet Money. For the Spiel, Sesame Street is moving to HBO, and you know what that means? Elmo’s gonna be naked.\nToday’s sponsors: Harry’s, the shaving company that offers German-engineered blades, well-designed handles, and shipping right to your door.
