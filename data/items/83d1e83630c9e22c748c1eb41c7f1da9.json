  "description": "Rep. Eric Swalwell of California has emerged as one of the most important voices in the Democratic Party. From his presidential campaign to his work during last year's impeachment hearings, he has stood out for both tough-mindedness and clarity. As the son and brother of police officers, he has strong views on how we need to reform policing in America in the wake of the abuses we have seen, especially in communities of color. This ties to his activism on the issue of gun control. We discuss both as well as his views on the Matt Gaetz scandal, the GOP's race to the bottom, the best strategy for a Democratic Party that must expand its margins in the Senate and House in 2022 and accountability for the Trump administration. Don't miss this insight-rich conversation. \nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
