  "description": "<p>Do you often find yourself in an internal battle between whether you should be doing more, or being more?</p> <p>It’s like when you’re meditating, all you can think about is your to-do list. But when you’re doing, you’re freaking exhausted and can’t wait to take a bath.</p> <p>Why do we believe it’s one or the other?</p> <p>The truth is, your highest form of expression comes when you merge doing and being as one. This is what I call your “sacred doing.”</p> <p>In this episode, I share my own realization coming out of the hustle mentality and realizing my greatest creations come when I’m being. This completely changed the energy from which I expressed my soul’s purpose, and even this podcast.</p> <p>I discuss how your soul’s purpose actually isn’t something you strive for or need to figure out, but rather what naturally arises from a state of being. That doesn’t mean checking out and doing nothing with your life.</p> <p>It means all that you create comes from the intentional place of wholeness. This episode will feel like an exhale and allow you to release all the tension you may unknowingly be holding onto around “figuring out” your dharma and will allow you to rest into your soul’s purpose.
