  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the Left continues to eat itself, as a gay rights organization that had been around for 50 years voluntarily dissolves and disbands after BLM criticized it. This is a convoluted but also instructive not to mention hilarious story, and we’ll talk about it today. Also Five Headlines including Olivia Rodrigo’s trip to the white house to promote vaccines, raising the question: who is Olivia Rodrigo? Speaking of BLM, they have finally spoken out about the situation in Cuba, in order to defend the Cuban government. And a state representative in Minnesota says he was racially profiled during a traffic stop. But the body cam footage shows something else. And in our Daily Cancellation we will wade into the murky, confused, and toxic waters of abortion Tik Tok. \nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
