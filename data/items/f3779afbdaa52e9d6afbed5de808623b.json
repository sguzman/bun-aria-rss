On this episode of Impact Theory with Tom Bilyeu, Chamillionaire explains exactly how he succeeded in hip hop, speaks passionately about the importance of forming and nurturing relationships, and even talks about how to overcome the primary roadblocks that stop most people from achieving their dreams.
