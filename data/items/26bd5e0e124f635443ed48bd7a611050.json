  "description": "The story of Pocahontas and John Smith has turned from compelling historical story of a brave woman who united two warring nations, to a melodramatic, oversimplified love story. In reality, Pocahontas likely never view Smith as more than a friend, since she was 11 when they first met. But they won't meet quite yet. We need to talk about the world they both inhabit, and the nations that will collide in the early 17th century. Then, on the creature of the week, you'll see why you want to bring hair clippers when checking on your infant in the middle of the night. check out the companies that were nice enough to sponsor this episode: http://Lootcrate.com/legends - offer code: LEGENDS (the Loot Crate community thing I talked about) http://Weebly.com/Myths Music:  \"Wipe my Face Away\" by Keshco \"Cloudz\" by Jahzzar All other music by Poddington Bear<p><a href=\"https://www.mythpodcast.com/membership\" rel=\"payment\">Support the show: https://www.mythpodcast.com/membership</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
