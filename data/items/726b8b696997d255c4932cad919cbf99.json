Their burnt-out vehicle was found nearby. Similarities were drawn to the double homicide of father and son, Marcus and Lance Bullen, that occurred days earlier at a remote river hundreds of kilometres away in the Northern Territory.<br>\n<br>\n---<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>Episode narrated by the <a href=\"https://twitter.com/casefilehost\">Anonymous Host</a>\n</div>\n<div>Researched and written by Gemma Harris<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<div>For all credits and sources please visit <a href=\"http://casefilepodcast.com/case-70-kimberley-murders/\">casefilepodcast.com/case-70-kimberley-murders<br>\n</a><br>\n\n</div>\n",
