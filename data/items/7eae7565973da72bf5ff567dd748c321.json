  "description": "<p>We're joined by two very special guests, Eventbrite CEO Julia Hartz and her cofounder, spouse and Eventbrite Chairman Kevin Hartz, to tell their story of building Eventbrite together (along with their lives and family) from the PayPal diaspora to bootstrapped business, unicorn status, IPO and now starting all over again in the wake of COVID with both a tragedy and a huge new opportunity in front of them as public company.</p> <p>If you want more more Acquired and the tools + resources to become the best founder, operator or investor you can be, join our LP Program for access to our LP Show (including the episode with Kevin on SPACs), the LP community on Slack and Zoom, and our new Book Club live sessions with authors like Hamilton Helmer of 7 Powers and Will Thorndike of The Outsiders. <strong>Join here at: <a href=\"https://acquired.fm/lp/\" rel= \"payment\">https://acquired.fm/lp/</a><br /> <br /></strong></p> <p><strong>New!</strong> We're codifying our own Playbook notes and takeaways from each episode, and posting them here in the show notes and on our website.

This is especially true in long-tail use cases that can only be aggregated by self-serve internet-based software. <ul> <li>One early encouraging sign for Eventbrite was its use to host speed dating events in New York. Before Eventbrite, it was nearly impossible to organize, promote, and charge for something like that. Now, organizers could suddenly become entrepreneurs and make real money hosting events like this. Most VCs ignored or were confused by this data (~\"Call us when you attack Ticketmaster.\"), but they missed that it unlocked a massive new market which previously operated only through word-of-mouth and cash transactions (if at all).</li> <li>All three major dislocations of the 21st century — the tech bubble bursting in 2001, the financial crisis in 2008, and now COVID in 2020 — have only accelerated offline behaviors to online. COVID is unlocking a new wave of online event entrepreneurs for Eventbrite in the same way the financial crisis unlocked a wave of in-person event entrepreneurs in 2008-10.</li> </ul> </li> <li><strong>Starting with just one niche can be incredibly powerful; often your customers will then lead you to more.</strong> <ul> <li>Before the speed-dating in New York (which was fully inbound), Eventbrite was used to organize tech meetups in the then-smaller tech community in SF.
