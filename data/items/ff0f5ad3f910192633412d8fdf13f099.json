  "description": "Zuby is a British rapper, author, and podcast host who went viral after claiming he broke the British women’s deadlift record because he “identified as a woman whilst lifting.” Raised in Saudi Arabia and working in the U.K., Zuby sees the United States as a country that raises its flags high even while plagued by the religion of social justice. Glenn and Zuby compare the U.S. and the U.K., from Boris Johnson and Brexit to the Second Amendment and homelessness. But on both sides of the pond and around the world, people are tired of corruption and want to be heard. Above all, Zuby strives for authenticity and truth in a world that would rather make everything political and polarizing. And he’s using his music and life to spread the message.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
