  "description": "<p>This week, Bishop Barron answers questions from listeners all over the world. These include:</p> <ul> <li>If animals have distinct personalities, then why does the Church teach they don’t have souls?</li> <li>What is being conveyed by identifying Jesus as the New Adam and Mary as the New Eve?</li> <li>Do you believe we have a predestined “purpose”?</li> <li>What can we say about the love of God to someone who has lost an infant to disease, or a parent to suicide?</li> <li>If evil is a privation of good (non-being), how can demons be pure non-being?</li> <li>Why do some people say, after they die, they wish to see God “face to face”? What does this mean?</li> <li>Does the Incarnation bring about the fulfillment of nature, or is Jesus’ divinity something supernaturally added to an already-complete human nature?</li> </ul> <p>If you have a question, be sure to send it in via <strong><a href= \"http://askbishopbarron.com/\">AskBishopBarron.com</a></strong>.</p> <p><strong><em>NOTE:</em></strong><em> Do you like this podcast? <a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/bishopbarron\">Become a patron</a> and get some great perks for helping, like free books, bonus content, and more.
