  "description": "Raise your hand if you have a child who likes to take charge. Now keep your hand raised if you’ve ever snapped “Stop being so bossy!” Hand still up? Well, Dr. Becky’s is too. And here’s the thing: You’re not a bad parent. And your kid’s not a bad kid. You have a good kid who has a hard time with flexibility. In this week’s episode, Dr. Becky discusses how to help your assertive child build the skills they need without shutting down their strong sense of self. She offers a new framework for “bossiness” and, as always, pairs her big ideas with practical parenting strategies you can use in your home right away. Two things are true: You can love that your child knows what they want *and* teach them how to make space for what others want, too. <p/>\n<p/>\nJoin Good Inside Membership: https://bit.ly/3cqgG2A  <p/>\nFollow Dr. Becky on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drbeckyatgoodinside <p/>\nSign up for our weekly email, Good Insider: https://www.goodinside.com/newsletter <p/>\nPre-order Dr. Becky's upcoming book, Good Inside: A Guide to Becoming the Parent You Want to Be, at goodinside.com/book or wherever you order your books.<p/>\n<p/>\n<p/>\n",
