  "description": "<p>The discovery of two-dimensional (2D) layered MoSi$_2$N$_4$ and WSi$_2$N$_4$\nwithout knowing their 3D parents by chemical vapor deposition in 2020 has\nstimulated extensive studies of 2D MA$_2$Z$_4$ system due to its structural\ncomplexity and diversity as well as versatile and intriguing properties. Here,\na comprehensive overview on the state-of-the-art progress of this 2D\nMA$_2$Z$_4$ family is presented. Starting by describing the unique sandwich\nstructural characteristics of the emerging monolayer MA$_2$Z$_4$, we summarize\nand anatomize their versatile properties including mechanics, piezoelectricity,\nthermal transport, electronics, optics/optoelectronics, and magnetism. The\nproperty tunability via strain engineering, surface functionalization and\nlayered strategy is also elaborated. Theoretical and experimental attempts or\nadvances in applying 2D MA$_2$Z$_4$ to transistors, photocatalysts, batteries\nand gas sensors are then reviewed to show its prospective applications over a\nvast territory. We further discuss new opportunities and suggest prospects for\nthis emerging 2D family. The overview is anticipated to guide the further\nunderstanding and exploration on 2D MA$_2$Z$_4$.\n</p>",
