  "description": "With the growth of social media like Facebook, Twitter, Instagram, and Snapchat, we are increasingly heading toward a radically open society. In Sharing our Lives Online: Risks and Exposure in Social Media (Palgrave Macmillan, 2014), author David R. Brake explores some of the social and individual harms that can arise from unwary social media use. Brake draws upon in-depth interviews with bloggers as well as scholarly research to explore why users may inadvertently reveal more online than they suppose. He explains in detail the social, technological, and commercial influences and pressures that keep us posting what we often shouldn’t and that prevent us from fully appreciating the risks when we do so.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
