  "description": "<p>The Therapy for Black Girls Podcast is a weekly conversation with Dr. Joy Harden Bradford, a licensed Psychologist in Atlanta, Georgia, about all things mental health, personal development, and all the small decisions we can make to become the best possible versions of ourselves.</p><p>Like many of you I’ve been spending a considerable amount of time watching all of the shows and thought it would be fun to have a little recap of what’s been happening on a couple of my favorites and dig into some of the themes that have popped up. Joining me today to chat about the most recent episodes of <em>This Is Us</em> and <em>Married at First Sight</em> is Beverley Andre, LMFT. Related to <em>This Is Us</em>, Beverley and I chatted about the power of the stories we hold onto in our lives, the impact of grief as shown in the episode, the symbolism of water, and the importance of having nonjudgmental safe spaces like the ones that often exist with our aunties. We also chatted about the newest season of <em>Married at First Sight.</em> We discussed some of our thoughts about the compatibility and readiness of some of the couples, what you might want to think about before choosing to apply for this type of show, our thoughts about what indicates success for the couples, and of course some of the red flags that already seem to be popping up this season.
