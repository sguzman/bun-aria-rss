But sometimes, it can be a place of negativity and false realities that can really affect our wellbeing.

She gives advice on how to handle it all, plus ways to practice healthy habits on social, and why she’s refusing to edit her photos on Instagram.\n \nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\n  \n Learn more about your ad choices.
