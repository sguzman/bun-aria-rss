  "description": "Comedian Jamie Kilstein had his whole world turned upside down by the #MeToo movement. Once a self-described far-left feminist, he was surprised at how quickly his own people disowned him over claims he knew were very skewed — and the support he got was from the people he once mocked. Now he’s sitting down for an interview with one of them, the notorious Glenn Beck himself. They discuss life for a comedian who’s tired of selling out to political correctness, the humbling rock-bottom experience that brought him here, and the honesty that the American people want so much.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
