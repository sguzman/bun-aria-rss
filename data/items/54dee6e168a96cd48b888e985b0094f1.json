  "title": "289 - Robert Yates: Serial Killing \"Family Man\"",
  "description": "<p>Robert Lee Yates often described himself as a \"family man.\" And he was a family man. He was a married father of five. Married to the mother of his children for over twenty years. He was also a decorated veteran who served in the military for over twenty years as well, most of that span in active duty service as a helicopter pilot of the army. He was, for many, the last person you would suspect to be a sexually motivated serial killer. But that's who he also was. Yates killed at least a dozen women in  1997 and 1998, most of them in Spokane, Washington, not far from the campus of Gonzaga University, where I was a student at that time. While I was studying and partying, less than a mile away, women were getting picked up, paid for sex, and then shot in the head by a wolf in sheep's clothing. Who is Robert Lee Yates, and why did he do what he did? We try and find out in this week's true crime edition of Timesuck. <br /><br />The Bad Magic Charity of the month is New Orleans Community Fridges  will be this months recipient of the Bad Magic Donation!
