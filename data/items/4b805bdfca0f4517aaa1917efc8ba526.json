  "description": "<p><p>Kirk Minihane took a train to New York City to finally get a competent co-host, and is joined by KFC to talk about Merloni, Francesa, Erika's email to the entire company, Call Her Daddy, Mikey's cousin, Dave's vacation, heroine on 7th avenue, and all the other related Barstool gossip. Kirk has a very busy day ahead of him with the Barstool Gold AMA that he is very much looking forward to. Sorry to Kirk's producers. </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
