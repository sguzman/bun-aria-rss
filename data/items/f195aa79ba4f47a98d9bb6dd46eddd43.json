  "description": "<p>Steve writes\"As I said first sighting when I was about 10 years old in East Central Kentucky on a fishing trip with my dad, my dad's best friend and his son who happened to be about my age.</p> <p>Me and the boy had picked out on s'mores over the campfire that we had built on a sandbar in the middle of the river because that's where we were camping. Approximately 3:00 a.m. I woke up with a bad stomach ache (probably from all the s'mores I gorge myself on) and was outside of the tent and stoked the fire back up when about 10 mins later I heard some swishing in the water as if somebody was walking in knee deep water against the current, it came up to within approximately 20 ft of me but did not come onto The Sandbar but stopped short to reach down and grabbed one of the two fish baskets and lifted its head up looked at me as if to say \"I'm taking these fish, please and thank you\" then walked back downstream with the basket of fish and I had no idea where it went after getting out of site of the fire glow. I got no ill intent from it, I was freaked out but not in a scared way.</p> <p>Told my dad about it when he got up..and he told keep quiet about it until we could be alone and talk openly.. which we did 2 days later.</p> <p>I have had one other siding which was a fleeting glimpse of a Sasquatch running back into the woods from the edge of a field, and have had two or three other weird experiences that later in life I've come to a tribute to Sasquatch experiences.\"</p>",
