  "title": "Marketplace Roundtable #85: Work From Home Plays That Are Less Obvious",
  "description": "Work from home tech plays have mostly been a software story, whether it's SaaS (software as a service) darlings like Zoom (ZM) or content plays like Netflix (NFLX). Momentum investing suggests that a stock that's going up is still a good bet, but it's hard to say that those names don't have significant valuations already.\nJoe Albano, author of Tech Cache, joined us to speak about the tech sector. While we didn't explicitly target this, we ended up having a discussion about less heralded beneficiaries of the work from home theme. With the increased demand on servers, semiconductor and memory chip suppliers such as Micron (MU) would seem to benefit. Joe also calls out a security play that he thinks is suited for the current environment, especially if the shares pull back a little more.",
