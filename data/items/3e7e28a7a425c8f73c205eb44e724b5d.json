  "description": "<p>In part two of our series on how John learned to connect with people, John Maxwell shares the remaining lessons he’s learned as he’s grown over the years as a communicator. You’ll learn the importance of using communication as a way to connect with your team and/or audience, to inspire others, and to cast a compelling vision.</p> <p>For the application portion of this episode, Mark Cole and Jason Brooks discuss how to avoid the “shortcut mentality”––the habit of taking shortcuts for skills you’re naturally good at. You’ll be challenged in this episode to study the communication skills of communicators you connect with and to ask for consistent feedback from others in order to learn how to be a better communicator and continually grow in your communication.</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this series is the Connecting with People Worksheet, which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching. You can download the worksheet by visiting MaxwellPodcast.com/Connected and clicking “Download the Bonus Resource.”</p> <p>References:</p> <p><a href= \"https://store.johnmaxwell.com/Everyone-Communicates-Few-Connect-Hardcover_p_2783.html\"> <em>Everyone Communicates, Few Connect</em> by John C.
