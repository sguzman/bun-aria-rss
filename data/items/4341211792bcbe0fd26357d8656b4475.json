  "description": "<p>This is one of our more contentious episodes. A respected and highly prescient marketing guru says marketing is about to change and at least one of us disagrees. We debate his ideas along with other marketing approaches, to see if we can find the sweet spot for artists. When is it a good idea to create long-form blog posts? How can content curation help with our networking? And when is it preferable to simply share what we're doing in short emails and social media posts?&nbsp;</p>\n<p>During the course of the conversation, Louise also shares a new idea she feels will help her build a new audience for her work, but Alice has her doubts. As always, we feel marketing is another area where we all have to find our own way. For some, committing to a monthly newsletter may feel good and for others it might feel like one too many commitments. Some might love the idea of curating from different sources while others prefer to simply report as they go. We hope this lively debate helps you decide what's right for you.</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p><strong>Alice's one-on-one coaching </strong><a href=\"https://bookme.name/alicesheridan\">https://bookme.name/alicesheridan</a></p>\n<p><strong>Brian Clark's podcast </strong><a href=\"https://unemployable.com/podcast/\">https://unemployable.com/podcast/</a></p>\n<p><strong>Gary Vaynerchuk You tube channel </strong><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCctXZhXmG-kf3tlIXgVZUlw\">https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCctXZhXmG-kf3tlIXgVZUlw</a></p>\n<p>Find us and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\">bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</a></p>\n<p>Support the podcast with a small donation at: <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\">https://ko-fi.com/artjuice</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p>Alice <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com@alicesheridanstudio/\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p>Louise <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p><em>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</em></p>\n",
