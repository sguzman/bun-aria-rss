  "description": "<p>For nearly three and a half decades, the disappearance of 12-year-old Jonelle Matthews was a mystery – a riddle neither authorities nor her family members could solve. The residents of her cloistered Colorado hometown had scoured every inch of prairie. The President of the United States appealed to journalists to help. Jonelle’s smiling face was printed on milk cartons nationwide. Still, every lead had fizzled. Every person of interest had turned out to be a dead end. Then, in 2019, Jonelle’s remains were unearthed near the foothills of the Rocky Mountains. With the discovery came troubling new questions: a man obsessed with the case also be her abductor and murderer? Had the truth been hiding in plain sight the entire time? From Campside Media and Wondery comes season two of SUSPECT. Former CNN reporter Ashley Fantz and executive producers Matthew Shaer and Eric Benson (Suspect, Over My Dead Body) dig into one of the most mind-bending cold cases in modern history, in an attempt to separate fact and fiction, compulsion from guilt, and true-crime fandom from a motive for murder.&nbsp;</p><p><br></p><p>To listen to more episodes of&nbsp;<em>Suspect: Vanished in the Snow</em>, sign into the Amazon Music app with your Prime account and follow&nbsp;<em>Suspect: Vanished in the Snow</em>.
