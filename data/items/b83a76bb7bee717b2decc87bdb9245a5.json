  "description": "Si learns what a bidet is, and John-David has STRONG feelings about bidets. During Sadie's podcast, Si discovers Willie wanted to fire him before \"Duck Dynasty,\" and oh, does he have thoughts. He also shares the story of the awful jobs he's had and how he ended up working at Duck Commander. Martin reveals that Si is an introvert who used to be camera shy, and Si explains what it takes for him to let his hair down. Si is enraptured by racing zebras on YouTube and penguin poop you can see from space. And the boys share what they'd request for their final meals. Today's Duck Call Room biodiversity tour brought to you by the Loch Ness Monster and chupacabras.
