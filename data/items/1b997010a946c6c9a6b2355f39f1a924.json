  "description": "<p>The importance of excellence has always been one of Andy Frisella's foundational values and one of the basic assumptions of The MFCEO Project. But in 150 episodes, Andy has never explicitly explained why excellence is so important - why it's everything. From how it undergirds the confidence necessary for success to how it protects us from the danger of laziness, The MFCEO unpacks and breaks down his thoughts on excellence - and shows exactly why it's essential to personal and professional success.</p>",
