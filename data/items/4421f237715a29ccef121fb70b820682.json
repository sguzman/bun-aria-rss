  "title": "256 - Cult! Cult! Cult! The Aggressive Christianity Mission Training Corps",
  "description": "<p>A very recent Christian militant cult, the Aggressive Christianity Mission Training Corps was founded in the late 1970s by married couple Lila and Jim Green. Lila would later change her name to Deborah, after the biblical prophetess of the God of the Israelites and the only female judge mentioned in the Bible. And she ruled her cult with an iron fist. And then, after decades of keeping her cult members continually worried about the devil and engaging in strange rituals like giving birth to spirit babies to become soldiers in god's army, Jim, Deb, and their son-in-law Peter Green were finally arrested on various charges of abuse, including sexual abuse of children. Today we explore the rise and fall of this sad, hateful little organization, and examine the popular fundamentalist, evangelical christianity it was born out of, on another cult! cult! cult! edition of Timesuck. <br /><br />We're donating $15,000 this month to The Wildland Firefighter Foundation. Since 1999, the Foundation has also provided emergency support services to the families of firefighters, seriously injured or killed in the line of duty. Families left behind, many with young children, often find themselves with few resources, and the Foundation steps in to help.</p>\n<p>Go to<strong> <a href=\"https://wffoundation.org/\">https://wffoundation.org/</a> </strong>to learn more. </p>\n<p><strong>Watch the Suck on YouTube: <a href=\"https://youtu.be/TjnNkFsyhDc\">https://youtu.be/TjnNkFsyhDc</a><br /><br /></strong><strong><a href=\"https://youtu.be/4Sxi48qqMbo\"></a></strong><strong>M</strong><strong>erch </strong> <strong>- <a href=\"https://badmagicmerch.com/\">https://badmagicmerch.com/</a>  <br /><br />Discord! </strong><strong><a href=\"https://discord.gg/tqzH89v\">https://discord.gg/tqzH89v</a></strong></p>\n<p>Want to join the Cult of the Curious private<strong> Facebook Group</strong>?
