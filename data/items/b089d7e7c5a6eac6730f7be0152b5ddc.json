  "description": "<p>Cosmological constraints on the sum of the neutrino masses can be relaxed if\nthe number density of active neutrinos is reduced compared to the standard\nscenario, while at the same time keeping the effective number of neutrino\nspecies $N_{\\rm eff}\\approx 3$ by introducing a new component of dark\nradiation. We discuss a UV complete model to realise this idea, which\nsimultaneously provides neutrino masses via the seesaw mechanism. It is based\non a $U(1)$ symmetry in the dark sector, which can be either gauged or global.\nIn addition to heavy seesaw neutrinos, we need to introduce $\\mathcal{O}(10)$\ngenerations of massless sterile neutrinos providing the dark radiation. Then we\ncan accommodate active neutrino masses with $\\sum m_\\nu \\sim 1$ eV, in the\nsensitivity range of the KATRIN experiment. We discuss the phenomenology of the\nmodel and identify the allowed parameter space. We argue that the gauged\nversion of the model is preferred, and in this case the typical energy scale of\nthe model is in the 10 MeV to few GeV range.\n</p>",
