  "description": "After initially cooperating with the select committee investigating the events of January 6, former White House chief of staff Mark Meadows reversed course, deciding instead to assert executive privilege. But Meadows had already handed over documents and text messages relating to that day—painting a picture of how Trump’s inner circle reacted as the Capitol was under siege. \n\nWhat happens to Meadows now that he’s been held in contempt of Congress? And could possible criminal charges for defying the committee spur other witnesses to speak? \n\nGuest: Nicholas Wu, congressional reporter for Politico.\n\nIf you enjoy this show, please consider signing up for Slate Plus.
