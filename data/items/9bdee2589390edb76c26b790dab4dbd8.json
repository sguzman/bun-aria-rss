  "description": "<p>Forepaugh's Restaurant was once housed within the beautiful mansion for which it is named. The restaurant shuttered in March of 2019 after the death of its Executive Chef. Before closing, this was considered one of the most haunted restaurants in Minnesota. There are thought to be at least three spirits in this former home, including the man who had it built. One has to wonder if these ghosts are lonely now. Join us as we explore the history and hauntings of Forepaugh's Restaurant. The Moment in Oddity features the Horned Helmet of Henry VIII and This Month in History features Dafydd ap Gruffydd Hanged, Drawn and Quartered.
