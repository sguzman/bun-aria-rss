The planning talks have escalated to the point where Trump allies are reportedly marking off dates on their calendars and booking their travel arrangements.</p>\n<p>The announcement will be followed by a series of political events to promote Trump&rsquo;s campaign, according to Axios. A Trump spokesman declined to comment on the plans. They still haven&rsquo;t been finalized and the timing could be pushed back based on the results of the congressional midterms, according to the media outlet.</p>\n<p>Trump and his allies have hinted in recent weeks that his 2024 campaign announcement is imminent, but they haven&rsquo;t publicly disclosed a date. His former campaign manager, <a href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/565921-trump-2024-announcement-soon/\">Kellyanne Conway</a>, told reporters that Trump had held back on launching his bid to avoid taking attention away from congressional candidates in the November 8 midterms. &ldquo;I think you can expect him to announce [it] soon.&rdquo;</p>\n\n            \n    <p>\n        <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/565921-trump-2024-announcement-soon/\">\n            <span>READ MORE: </span>Trump expected to make announcement on presidential bid ‚Äòsoon‚Äô\n        </a>\n    </p>\n\n    \n\n<p>The former president appeared to be setting the table for his 2024 announcement on Thursday night at a rally in Sioux City, Iowa. <em>&ldquo;In order to make our country successful and safe and glorious, I will very, very, very probably do it again, OK?&rdquo;</em> he told the cheering crowd.

Only 26% of Americans want Biden to seek re-election, while only 27% want Trump to run again, according to a <a href=\"https://www.usatoday.com/story/news/politics/2022/10/28/biden-trump-rematch-2024-suffolk-poll/10596438002/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">USA Today/Suffolk University</a> poll that was released last week. Recent polls suggest that voters in at least two key swing states &ndash; Florida and Ohio &ndash; believe another Republican, Ron DeSantis, would have a better chance than Trump of winning the presidency in 2024.</p>\n\n            \n    <p>\n        <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.rt.com/news/565917-poll-us-voters-expect-biden-impeachment/\">\n            <span>READ MORE: </span>Voters expect Republicans to impeach Biden ‚Äì poll\n        </a>\n    </p>\n\n    \n\n<p></p>",
