The aircraft that breached the ADIZ was at the southwest corner of the zone, in the same area where a record 56 Chinese jets flew on October 4.</p>\n<p>However, contrary to an allegation by US Senator Robert Menendez, who visited Taiwan last April, the Chinese jets didn&rsquo;t cross into Taiwanese airspace. The ADIZ extends far beyond Taipei&rsquo;s territory, covering the region where Taiwan monitors aircraft for security purposes.</p>\n<p>China has ramped up military exercises in the region around Taiwan since August, when US House Speaker Nancy Pelosi defied Beijing&rsquo;s warnings against visiting Taipei. In response to the row, China cut off military and climate ties with the US and conducted wargames in the Taiwan Strait.</p>\n\n            <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">9 PLA aircraft and 2 PLAN vessels around our surrounding region were detected today (Nov. 5, 2022) until 1700(GMT+8). <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ROCArmedForces?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ROCArmedForces</a> have monitored the situation and responded to these activities with aircraft in CAP, naval vessels, and land-based missile systems. <a href=\"https://t.co/LbB1M57N6D\">pic.twitter.com/LbB1M57N6D</a></p>&mdash; åœ‹é˜²éƒ¨ Ministry of National Defense, R.O.C. ðŸ‡¹ðŸ‡¼ (@MoNDefense) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/MoNDefense/status/1588863854863605760?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 5, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n    \n\n<p>China has vowed to reunify with Taiwan, by force if necessary, and considers the island to be part of its sovereign territory.
