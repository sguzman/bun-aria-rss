  "description": "<p>Not since Abbott and Costello Met Frankenstein has a meeting been so highly anticipated as today’s episode of The Cigar Authority. Today we speak with Richard Hacker, author of The Ultimate Cigar Book and contributor to Cigar Aficionado and the Robb Report. We will do something almost unheard of on the ultimate cigar podcast and talk cigars. We will discuss how the industry has changed between the 1st edition and the 4th edition of the Ultimate Cigar Book all while we smoke something from Dave’s vault; House of Windsor Sportsman 1980.</p>\n<p>In the second hour we fire up El Tallo from The Cigar Authority care package and Dave has a bone to pick with Mr. Jonathan over last weeks Offer of the Day. Will Dave welch on a bet? Did Jonathan attempt to pull a fast one? Tune in to hear this outcome.</p>\n<p>We will have this all the usual suspects including Versus, Offer of the Day, Cigar News and a peek into the Asylum. The Cigar Authority is a member of the United Podcast Network and is recorded live in front of a studio audience at Studio 21 Podcast Cafe upstairs at Two Guys Smoke Shop in Salem, NH and as always you can find many of the cigars we discuss at <a href='https://www.youtube.com/redirect?q=http%3A%2F%2Fwww.2GuysCigars.com%2F&redir_token=__oxaDyDdFvL0tSDitXGL8P7Hqd8MTU2NTQ2OTY0NkAxNTY1MzgzMjQ2&event=video_description&v=5KB10PtanU4'>http://www.2GuysCigars.com/</a>.</p>\n<p>Never miss an episode by subscribing to the show via <a href='http://itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/the-cigar-authority/id413869893?mt=2&ign-mpt=uo%3D4'>Apple Podcasts</a> and <a href='http://thecigarauthority.podbean.com/'>Podbean</a></p>\n",
