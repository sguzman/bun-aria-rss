  "description": "<p>Raised on an island in South Carolina, singer/songwriter&nbsp;<a href=\"http://trevorhallmusic.com\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Trevor&nbsp;Hall</a>&nbsp;realized at a young age that music was more than just a passion - it was his life’s art. So, he moved to California to pursue a degree in music, began performing live shows and was quickly signed to his dream deal at a major label. His trajectory seemed meteoric, then everything came tumbling down. His albums never made it out of production, he found himself out of money, abandoned by his label and on his own to figure out how to move forward.</p><p>During this same time, he was also introduced to yoga and meditation and found himself traveling to a local ashram to practice and eventually find housing and sustenance. In his time of greatest need, he found himself living in the ashram, then traveling to India and rediscovering who he really was and how he wanted to bring his music and voice to the world. From there, he began to rebuild not only his living as a musician, but also his life.</p><p>Hall’s music, a blend of roots and folk music with hints of inspiration from India, has since led him to a series of sold-out tours and collaborations with artists such as Steel Pulse, The Wailers, Jimmy Cliff, Matisyahu, Michael Franti, Xavier Rudd and Nahko & Medicine for the People. Trevor Hall’s Chapter of the Forest (2014) and KALA (2015), debuted at #3 and #2 on the iTunes singer/songwriter chart respectively. He is currently touring around the US and Australia. While on tour, Hall collects donations to support children’s education in India.</p><p>Hall’s latest album, The Fruitful Darkness, became the #1 Kickstarter Music campaign of 2017 and&nbsp;debuted at #9 on the iTunes alternative chart.</p><p>Be sure to listen to the end, where Trevor shares a moving acoustic rendition of one of his songs, live in the studio.</p><p>-------------</p><p>Have you discovered your&nbsp;Sparketype&nbsp;yet?&nbsp;Take the Sparketype Assessment™ now.
