  "description": "At the end of the Cold War, the West triumphantly crowed that it was our open societies and the information revolution that ultimately defeated the USSR.  They lost because people deprived of information simply couldn't compete.  Now however, as we enter another stage of the information revolution, it may be that we celebrated yet another premature \"mission accomplished\" moment.
