  "description": "<p>Conventional wisdom tells us that getting out of debt is smart. And while generally that might be true, we're here to explain how that approach may not be the best decision for you! Oftentimes keeping low-interest debt around while you're able to invest and maximize your returns elsewhere will easily make the most sense when you're looking at the numbers. In this episode we cover the characteristics of good debt and bad debt, and then we talk through some helpful pointers on how to manage your current debt.</p><p>Remember this one thing: somewhere around <strong>7% is the magic number that separates low interest debt from high interest debt</strong>. That's the interest rate that acts as a divider in our current market. Anything higher than that you'll want to pay off sooner than later, and anything lower than that, there is a good chance you can take those extra payments and invest to make a big enough return to make it worthwhile. Listen to the entire episode to hear us break it down because it's a very nuanced topic!</p><p>At the beginning of this episode we each cracked open and enjoyed a beer called Infusion A - Coffee Porter by Hoppin' Frog Brewery, a peanut buttery porter which you can learn all about on Untappd.
