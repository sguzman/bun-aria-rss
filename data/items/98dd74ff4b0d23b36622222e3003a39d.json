  "description": "<h2>For The Love Of Volcanoes</h2>\n<p>A new documentary, “Fire of Love,” tells the story of French volcanologists Katia and Maurice Krafft. The married couple spent two decades chasing volcanic eruptions across the world. Katia was a geochemist and Maurice a geologist. Together, they studied <a href=\"https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/fire-of-love-documentary/?utm_source=wnyc&amp;utm_medium=podcast&amp;utm_campaign=scifri\" target=\"_blank\">the science of volcanoes</a> and produced films showcasing their power. That is, until their deaths in 1991, when they were killed by the very thing they loved so much.</p>\n<p>Guest host Sophie Bushwick talks with Sara Dosa, director of the documentary “Fire of Love,” which is in theaters nationwide, and will be available on Disney+ later this year.<br><br></p>\n<hr>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>A Blind Researcher Making A More Accessible World</h2>\n<p>Joshua Miele has spent his career trying to make the world more accessible for blind and visually impaired people. As a blind person, his lived experiences have shaped the way he thinks about technology and how it can be used to better serve disabled people. He’s invented products like <a href=\"https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/joshua-miele-adaptive-technology/?utm_source=wnyc&amp;utm_medium=podcast&amp;utm_campaign=scifri\" target=\"_blank\">YouDescribe—a tool that adds audio description to YouTube videos</a>—and Tactile Maps Automated Production, a software that creates tactile maps for people to feel.</p>\n<p>Although adaptive technologies try to help disabled people access information, it isn’t always driven by the input and needs of disabled people. There needs to be more disabled designers, engineers, and researchers spearheading this work, Miele says. Now, he works as a principal accessibility researcher at Amazon’s Lab126, where he helps make products like the <a href=\"https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/joshua-miele-adaptive-technology/?utm_source=wnyc&amp;utm_medium=podcast&amp;utm_campaign=scifri\" target=\"_blank\">Echo and Fire tablets more accessibl</a>e.</p>\n<p>Guest host Sophie Bushwick speaks with Miele about how his own experiences shape his work, and the importance of disability inclusion in designing new technologies.<br><br></p>\n<hr>\n<p> </p>\n<h2>What You Might Not Have Known About The Vagina</h2>\n<p>When it comes to researching human genitals and the organs called, in simple terms, “reproductive,” the penis has long been the star of the show.</p>\n<p>“It doesn’t help to only look at one or the other. Only by zooming out can we see them in their full range of variation and possibility,” writes science journalist Rachel E. Gross in her book, Vagina Obscura: An Anatomical Voyage, which tells the long history of neglected research into the vagina and its companion organs—the uterus, clitoris, Fallopian tubes, and ovaries. The book takes readers through myths, mysteries, and the legacy of shame around sexuality. It also introduces researchers who are <a href=\"https://www.sciencefriday.com/segments/vagina-obscura-rachel-gross/?utm_source=wnyc&amp;utm_medium=podcast&amp;utm_campaign=scifri\" target=\"_blank\">finally making breakthroughs in our understanding of fertility</a>, pleasure, and even immune health that’s been linked to these organs.</p>\n<p>The book interviews doctors who are using that knowledge to make life better for everyone—including cancer patients and older people going through menopause, transgender women who want their own vaginas, people with endometriosis, and those, including intersex people, looking to regain pleasure and agency after childhood genital cutting.</p>\n<p>Producer Christie Taylor interviews Gross about our growing understanding of clitoral anatomy, the long-misunderstood egg cell, the uterus’ ability to heal, and more. Plus, why these organs are important for whole-body health, and why everyone needs to understand them better.</p>\n<p>To read an excerpt from Vagina Obscura: An Anatomical Voyage by Rachel E.
