  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">Your brain is a powerful force that regulates so many functions and processes in your body. Everything from memory and emotion to temperature and metabolism are controlled by this complex and dynamic organ. Because of the expansive nature of the human brain, the field of neuroscience is vast and ever-evolving.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p class=\"p1\">Dr. Lisa Mosconi is a world-renowned neuroscientist who is ranked amongst the top 1% of scientists in the past 20 years. Dr. Mosconi studies the fascinating and growing intersection of neuroscience and nutrition, including how what we eat impacts our brain health and can ultimately determine our susceptibility to neurodegenerative diseases. She is the director of the Women’s Brain Initiative and the associate director of the Alzheimer’s Prevention Clinic at Weill Cornell Medicine, an adjunct faculty member at the NYU Department of Psychiatry, and the author of two incredible bestselling books, <em>Brain Food</em> and <em>The XX Brain</em>.<span class=\"Apple-converted-space\"> </span></p> <p class=\"p1\">On today’s show, you’re going to hear two powerful excerpts from previous interviews with Dr. Lisa Mosconi. She’s sharing the science on a wide variety of topics under the umbrella of brain health—including how Alzheimer’s disease develops over time, what your brain is made of and what nutrients it needs to survive, how men and women’s brains differ, and so much more. We can all learn more about how to nourish and protect our brain health, and I hope this episode empowers you to do just that.
