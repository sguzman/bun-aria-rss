  "description": "Few working composers transcend their compositional means as thoroughly as Tim Hecker. Hecker's sixth and most recent album — titled Ravedeath, 1972 — is an enveloping, almost suffocating exploration of noise music. Hecker buries melodies and rhythms in a deluge of dissonance and sound, obfuscating instrumentation; sifting through the thick, ambient textures of \"The Piano Drop\" is as gratifying as it is hypnotic. Hear Hecker's textured noise in a full concert, recorded live on October 30, 2011 at Moogfest in Asheville, N.C.",
