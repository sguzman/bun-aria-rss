  "description": "<p>On this episode of the She Reads Truth podcast, founders Reachel Myers and Amanda Bible Williams, and She Reads Truth content director, John Greco, go in-depth about the tension of the “already and not yet” of the gospel. How do we find beauty in brokenness? How does God enter into our trials? How do we give thanks when we are suffering? </p><p>Amanda, Raechel, and John talk about the first Thanksgiving and how the holiday has been a delicate dance of celebration and sorrow from the start. Amanda remembers what it felt like to give thanks while her 4-year-old son was on life support. And the group discusses the right-now and future hope we have in Jesus. </p><p><b>Read with Us: </b></p><p>This episode corresponds to Week 2 of the <a href='https://shereadstruth.com/plans/mourning-dancing/'>She Reads Truth Mourning & Dancing reading plan</a> found on the <a href='https://apps.apple.com/us/app/she-reads-truth-bible-devotional/id892128363'>She Reads Truth app</a> and <a href='https://shereadstruth.com/plans/mourning-dancing/'>SheReadsTruth.com</a>. </p><p><a href='https://www.shopshereadstruth.com/collections/mourning-dancing'>Mourning & Dancing Study Book </a></p><p><b>Open Your Bibles: (passages referenced in this episode) </b></p><p><a href='https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Matthew+9%3A14%E2%80%9317&version=CSB'>Matthew 9:14–17</a><br/><a href='https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+14%3A18&version=CSB'>John 14:18</a><br/><a href='https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=ecc+3%3A1-8&version=CSB'>Ecclesiastes 3:1–8</a><br/><a href='https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+56%3A8&version=CSB'>John 56:8</a><br/><a href='https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Acts+16%3A25&version=CSB'>Acts 16:25</a><br/><a href='https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=rev+21%3A3-5&version=CSB'>Revelation 21:3–5</a><br/><a href='https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Psalm+56:8&version=CSB'>Psalm 56:8</a><br/><a href='https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=col+1%3A13&version=CSB'>Colossians 1:13</a><br/><a href='https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+6%3A68&version=CSB'>John 6:68</a><br/><a href='https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=Genesis+50%3A20&version=CSB'>Genesis 50:20</a><br/><a href='https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Thessalonians+5%3A16-18&version=CSB'>1 Thessalonians 5:16</a><a href='https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=rev+21%3A3-5&version=CSB'>–</a><a href='https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=1+Thessalonians+5%3A16-18&version=CSB'>18</a><br/><a href='https://www.biblegateway.com/passage/?search=John+16%3A20&version=CSB'>John 16:20</a></p><p><b>Other Links: </b></p><p><a href='https://www.history.com/news/first-thanksgiving-colonists-native-americans-men'>Who Was at the First Thanksgiving?</a> (History.com article)<br/>“You never know how much you really believe anything until its truth or falsehood becomes a matter of life and death to you.
