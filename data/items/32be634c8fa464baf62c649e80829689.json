There are a ton of links throughout, and I included the slide notes so you have those along with the presentation (I&#8217;m not sure why all of the URLS aren&#8217;t automatically linked, so you have to copy and paste some, sorry.) I&#8217;m prepping for another presentation right now and don&#8217;t have time to write a whole lot about it &#8211; so without further ado, here are the PDF files with the slides and the notes:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Can-a-Machine-Be-Racist-or-Sexist-Renee-Teate-2-per-pg.pdf\" target=\"_blank\">SLIDES</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Can-a-Machine-Be-Racist-or-Sexist-Renee-Teate-outline-view.pdf\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">[SOME] NOTES &#038; LINKS</a></p>\n<p>Just noticed the link above still doesn&#8217;t contain all of the notes and links&#8230; I need to figure out how to save that to PDF in the right format from Powerpoint. For now, here&#8217;s the full slide + notes view with all links. Just don&#8217;t print it &#8211; it&#8217;s almost 100 pages long!<br />\n<a href=\"https://www.becomingadatascientist.com/wp-content/uploads/2018/04/Can-a-Machine-Be-Racist-or-Sexist-Renee-Teate-notes-pages.pdf\">SLIDES WITH NOTES &#038; LINKS</a></p>\n<p>Update: There&#8217;s a video on YouTube of <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=_ZLGAOstE9w&#038;list=PLTnOXzOljuWa3xa3yf2FSFEh8mqj1q9KF&#038;index=7\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">this talk</a> and <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=Zc_-ImDxIPE&#038;list=PLTnOXzOljuWa3xa3yf2FSFEh8mqj1q9KF&#038;index=8\" rel=\"noopener\" target=\"_blank\">the panel</a> that followed!</p>\n",
