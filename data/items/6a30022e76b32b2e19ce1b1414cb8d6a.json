  "description": "<p>In this 73rd in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens. This episode marks the one year anniversary of the Evolutionary Lens! We discuss its origin, and talk about the books we’ve read from on-air over the last year. In other news: A ship is stuck in the Suez Canal; Bret has an Evergreen take on the situation. Also the former head of the CDC, Robert Redfield, says that lab leak is the most likely origin for SARS-CoV2. Meanwhile, RT wants us to believe that the Amazon rainforest causes global warming. In happier news, saffron seems to lift depression. And finally: why we should absolutely be talking about detransition, which is what happens when people who have transitioned decide that they made an error, and work to regain their former sexual identities, health, and lives.<br/><br/>Our book, A Hunter-Gatherer’s Guide to the 21st Century, is now available for pre-sale at amazon.
