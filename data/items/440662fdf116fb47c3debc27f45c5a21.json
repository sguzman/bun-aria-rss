Premiering at Sundance, it was fêted with the festival’s highest award before going on to become an indie cult classic.</p><p>In addition to countless appearances in both movies and television, Kevin has created a litany of films, affectionately and collectively referred to by his many rabid fans as the&nbsp;<em>View Askewiverse,</em>&nbsp;a nod to Kevin’s production shingle, View Askew Productions.</p><p>Returning to his roots (did he ever leave?), Kevin toured his latest film,&nbsp;<em>Jay and Silent Bob Reboot&nbsp;</em>(featuring names like Chris Hemsworth and Ben Affleck) to roadshow box office success, promoting it with pre-pandemic live events in over 60 cities across North America.</p><p>An iconic and beloved character amongst indie film fans and comic book nerds, Kevin has always been immediately recognizable and famous for his hockey jerseys, backward hat and well, his weight.&nbsp;&nbsp;But in February of 2018, Kevin had a near-fatal heart attack.</p><p>A lifestyle change was needed. Desperately. Enter Harley.</p><p>An actress, animal rights activist and bass player for the bubblegum punk band, The Tenth, Harley suggested —some might say&nbsp;<em>coerced</em>—Kevin to adopt her plant-based ways. Kevin obliged. In short, he dropped 50 pounds and kept the weight off. His blood work normalized. And the rest is history.</p><p>Together they recently launched&nbsp;<em>Vegan Abattoir</em>—a daddy daughter podcast affair that&nbsp;provides plant-based answers to the vegan-curious questions they get from a meat-eating and dairy-drinking audience. Dare you enter? If so you can catch yours truly in&nbsp;episode 2.</p><p>Picking up where I left off with Kevin in last year’s barnburner 2.5 hour Vulcan mind meld (<a href=\"https://www.richroll.com/podcast/kevin-smith-433/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">RRP #433</a>), Today’s discussion centers primarily on veganism and animal rights.

And while this conversation is light, I promise there is much to be gleaned — especially if you are new to the vegan world or perhaps contemplating a more-plant based approach to your plate and life.</p><p>I’ve interviewed a lot of people.
