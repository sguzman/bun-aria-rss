  "description": "<p>We show that we can derive the asymptotic Einstein's equations that arises at\norder $1/r$ in asymptotically flat gravity purely from symmetry considerations.\nThis is achieved by studying the transformation properties of functionals of\nthe metric and the stress-energy tensor under the action of the Weyl BMS group,\na recently introduced asymptotic symmetry group that includes arbitrary\ndiffeomorphisms and local conformal transformations of the metric on the\n2-sphere. Our derivation, which encompasses the inclusion of matter sources,\nleads to the identification of covariant observables that provide a definition\nof conserved charges parametrizing the non-radiative corner phase space. These\nobservables, related to the Weyl scalars, reveal a duality symmetry and a\nspin-2 generator which allow us to recast the asymptotic evolution equations in\na simple and elegant form as conservation equations for a null fluid living at\nnull infinity. Finally we identify non-linear gravitational impulse waves that\ndescribe transitions among gravitational vacua and are non-perturbative\nsolutions of the asymptotic Einstein's equations. This provides a new picture\nof quantization of the asymptotic phase space, where gravitational vacua are\nrepresentations of the asymptotic symmetry group and impulsive waves are\nencoded in their couplings.\n</p>",
