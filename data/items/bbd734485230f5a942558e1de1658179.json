  "description": "In this episode, David Solomon reflects on his first year as Goldman Sachs CEO: “I've been very focused on making sure that our client focus is at the center of everything we do, and that we really work with our clients as one firm,” he says. “We're a divisional firm, we've always been a divisional firm, but I think there's a great opportunity to make sure for our clients that we're delivering the whole firm.” Looking toward year two, Solomon says his priorities are about execution – from centralizing the firm's investing platforms to scaling new business initiatives, such as the Apple-Goldman Sachs credit card. “The big thing that we as a leadership team -- and I'm very personally focused on -- is the rollout of our broader strategy,” Solomon says.",
