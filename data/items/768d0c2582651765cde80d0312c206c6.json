  "description": "Murder of Elizabeth DeCaro. March 6th, 1992. St. Charles County, Missouri. A parolee by the name of Daniel Anthony Basile murdered Elizabeth DeCaro in her St. Charles County home. Her family had gone on a trip while she stayed behind. Basile had waited in the home for her to return from work and shot her twice from behind. An investigation uncovered a possible motive; money. Her husband was said to have paid Basile to murder her. The couple had been experiencing marital and financial issues. Did Elizabeth's husband, Richard DeCaro, pay to have his wife killed? The details of this case are almost unbelievable, unless you happen to watch a lot of true crime shows. But even then, there are aspects to this case that will make you shake your head. After the episode there is an update on the Holly Bobo case. Zach Adams, the man at the center of the trial, was recently sentenced after being found guilty.\n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
