    "media:description": "In the 70s, there was metal - Black Sabbath, Led Zeppelin, Deep Purple. And then there was punk, Sex Pistols, The Clash, The Damned. Two separate entities that rarely if ever mixed. However a band both subcultures could agree on was Motörhead.\n\nLed by the hoarse rumble of Lemmy, with their first three albums they cemented their place as one of the loudest bands Britain has ever produced. But the lead single from their fourth album proved they could be metal heavy, mangle it with a punk attitude and still be able to crossover to the pop charts. This is New British Canon and this is the story of \"Ace of Spades.\"\n\n#Motorhead #Lemmy #MusicDocumentary\n\nFact-checking by Serenity Autumn.\n\nSoundtrack\nLuar - Citrine (https://soundcloud.com/luarbeats)\nJesse Gallagher - Maestro Tlakaelel\nLuar - Anchor (https://soundcloud.com/luarbeats)\n\n00:00 Prologue\n00:51 Lemmy: An Introduction\n04:00 Motörhead: \"Remember Me Now...\"\n10:55 \"The Only Card I Need is...\": Ace of Spades\n16:06 The Enduring Impact of Motörhead\n\nYou can also follow me here:\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/TrashTheory\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/TrashTheoryYT\n\nOr support me on Patreon:\nhttps://www.patreon.com/TrashTheory",
