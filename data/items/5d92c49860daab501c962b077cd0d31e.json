A full deep dive into one of our favorite — or possibly our favorite! — romcoms…Moonstruck! Moonstruck was released December 18th, 1987, one day after Sarah turned nine…auspicious Sagittarius energy! It’s set in Brooklyn, is a perfect romance novel on film, and features more than one wolf, bewitched by the full moon. It is everything.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Go watch it (you won’t be sorry), then come back here and listen to us wax poetic about it. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Thank you for being with us for 200 episodes…you’re the moonlight in our martini.   </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><strong>Show Notes</strong></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Moonstruck was released on Dec 18, 1987. It was nominated for several oscars. Cher won for best actress, Olympia Dukakis for best supporting actress, and Best Original Screenplay for John Patrick Shanley.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\"><a href=\"https://www.esquire.com/entertainment/movies/a34691455/moonstruck-italian-american-movie-essay/?scrlybrkr=958e9960\">Everyone loves Moonstruck</a> and there are lots of fun <a href=\"https://www.mentalfloss.com/article/84010/13-enchanting-facts-about-moonstruck\">listicles</a> and <a href=\"https://2020.cinepunx.com/we-are-here-to-love-the-wrong-people-and-die-romance-and-mortality-in-moonstruck/\">essays</a> about the movie. Here’s <a href=\"https://twitter.com/vulture/status/1246210882348212227?s=20\">a great thread from Vulture</a> where a movie critic named Rachel Handler live-tweeted a rewatch.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Most of the film’s <a href=\"https://youtu.be/v9t7PMToEoE\">exteriors were filmed in Brooklyn</a>, but many interiors were shot <a href=\"https://torontoist.com/2011/07/reel_toronto_cinematic_classic_grab-bag/\">in Toronto.</a></p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Sarah mentioned an essay by Emily VanDerWerff, <a href=\"https://www.criterion.com/current/posts/7192-moonstruck-life-in-the-in-between\"><em>Moonstruck: Life in the In-Between</em></a>, about the beauty shop scene and how it can be analyzed as showing the power of the female gaze in Moonstruck.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">The last scene at the breakfast table is a good example of <a href=\"https://thedramateacher.com/farce/\">farce</a>. An article about the making of Moonstruck and <a href=\"https://thewalrus.ca/the-making-of-moonstruck/\">the ending scene played in the style of a farce</a>, with lots of cool info on Loretta's grandfather, played by Feodor Chaliapin Jr.</p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">Jen liked all <a href=\"https://twitter.com/JenReadsRomance/status/1578910561797959680?s=20\">that moon stuff</a>. </p><p class=\"\" style=\"white-space:pre-wrap;\">When Cher won the Oscar, she was wearing <a href=\"https://www.vanityfair.com/hollywood/2022/02/awards-insider-the-making-of-chers-oscar-revenge-dress\">a very memorable dress</a>. May we all vow to live our 40s with her as our guide.</p>",
