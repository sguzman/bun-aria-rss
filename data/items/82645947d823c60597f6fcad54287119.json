He's a partner at The Collaborative Fund which is a venture capital firm that invests in companies that are trying to make the world a better place. Morgan is also a former columnist at The Motley Fool and the Wall Street Journal but his work has also been published in Time, USA Today, Business Insider. He's truly an expert on behavioral finance and he recently published his book, \"The Psychology of Money: Timeless lessons on wealth, greed, and happiness.\" This episode is all about the behavioral aspects of our money, because as Morgan explains- there is a massive gap between <em>knowing</em> the right things to do with our money, and <em>doing</em> the right things with our money.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Polygamy Porter by Wasatch Brewery- thanks to Sam for donating this one to the podcast!
