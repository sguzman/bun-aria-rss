  "description": "I AM ATHLETE | Season 3: Episode 16\n\nBrandon Marshall, Jared Odrick and Nick “Swaggy P” Young connect with former Tampa Bay Buccaneers wide receiver Antonio “AB” Brown in episode 16 of I Am Athlete. AB is currently at the center of the conversation after he was released by the Tampa Bay Buccaneers for taking his jersey off and running off the field mid-game vs the New York Jets at Met Life Stadium. Brandon and Jared travel across the country from Miami to L.A. to sit down with AB in efforts to find out if AB’s actions were reactionary or responsive. \n\nAntonio sits down with the I Am Athlete crew in a Kumbaya session to answer questions surrounding the week 17, 3rd quarter incident vs the Jets. AB walks the crew through what led up to the moment on the sideline where he made the decision to strip off his shoulder pads, shirt and gloves and throw them into the crowd before running into the locker room as he flashed a peace sign. AB emphasizes that coach Bruce Arians tried to get him to play while he was injured, and that Arians then told him to get the F--- out after brown pleaded with him that he couldn’t play. \n\nBrandon shares how he would have handled the situation with head coach Bruce Arians and then asks Antonio if he thinks he could have handled his situation in differently. AB explains that he doesn’t regret the way that he handled the moment at MetLife Stadium and explains that there isn’t anything wrong with his mental health and that he refuses to compromise his integrity. AB brings mental health into the center of the discussion after he questions how do NFL players maintain their mental health while still protecting and keeping their integrity? \n\nMoving the conversation along, AB reveals that his relationship with Tom Brady is still intact and that he believes Brady is a great leader and that he is one of the best in NFL. Brandon asks AB what quarterbacks he thinks is next in line behind Brady. AB responds that he believes Lamar Jackson is the next greatest NFL quarterback and that everyone needs to give him his flowers now.\n\nWrapping things up, the group decides to give out “flowers” to those that have made an impact in their lives or others. Brandon, Jared and Swaggy end the episode by sharing that the I Am Athlete family is rooting for him and wishes him the best.\n\n0:00 - Intro\n2:36 - DraftKings \n3:30 - Commercials\n6:04 - Music, Kanye, Madonna and Floyd Mayweather\n11:21 - Mental Health and CTE\n24:55 - Being Responsive vs Reactive \n29:01 - Principles, Integrity and Mental Health\n50:14 - Tom Brady, Lamar Jackson and whats next\n1:01:20 - Giving out flowers\n1:03:58 - End\n1:03:57 - Credits\n\nWATCH MORE → https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list...\nSUBSCRIBE → https://www.youtube.com/c/IAMATHLETE\n\nSHOP NOW → \"CRAZY WORK\" Tee\nhttps://houseofathlete.com/products/iaa-crazy-work-tee\n\nSPECIAL THANKS TO\n\nFollow I AM ATHLETE:\nOfficial Site: https://iamathletetv.com/\nYouTube: https://www.youtube.com/iamathlete\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/IAMATHLETEpod\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/iamathletep...\nTikTok: https://www.tiktok.com/@iamathlete_po...\n\nFollow HOUSE OF ATHLETE:\nOfficial Site: https://houseofathlete.com/\nInstagram: https://www.instagram.com/thehouseofa...\nFacebook: https://www.facebook.com/houseofathlete\nApparel Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/houseofathl...\nHoA Supplements on Amazon: https://www.amazon.com/houseofathlete\n\n\n#IAMATHLETE #MoreThanAPodcast #BrandonMarshall #JaredOdrick #SwaggyP #NickYoung #AntonioBrown #AB\n\nSPECIAL THANKS TO:\n- INI IKPE: PRODUCER\n- BIANCA DIAZ: PRODUCTION MANAGER\n- INDIA ROBINSON: PRODUCTION ASSISTANT \n\nDRAFTKINGS:\nIf you or someone you know has a gambling problem, crisis counseling and referral services can be accessed by calling 1-800-GAMBLER (1-800-426-2537) (IL/IN/MI/NJ/PA/WV/WY), 1-800-NEXT STEP (AZ), 1-800-522-4700 (CO/NH), 888-789-7777/visit ccpg.org/chat (CT), 1-800-BETS OFF (IA), 877-8-HOPENY/text HOPENY (467369) (NY), call/text TN REDLINE 1-800-889-9789 (TN), or 1-888-532-3500 (VA). 21+ (18+ NH/WY). \n\nPhysically present in AZ/CO/CT/IL/IN/IA/MI/NH/NJ/NY/PA/TN/VA/WV/WY only.
