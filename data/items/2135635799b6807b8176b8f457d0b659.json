  "description": "Philip Mirowski is author of Never Let A Serious Crisis Go To Waste: How Neoliberalism Survived the Financial Meltdown (Verso Books 2013). Mirowski is the Carl Koch Chair of Economics and the History of Philosophy at the University of Notre Dame. He’s previous authored Science-Mart, Machine Dreams, and More Heat than Light.\n\nMirowski brings his broad background as an economist, historian, and philosopher to this meaty subject. He weaves together a stinging critique of the ways many economists reacted to the recent economic crisis with a larger discussion of the nature of economic ideas in politics. He highlights the rise of the Mont Pelerin Society and its links to what he dubs the Neoliberal Thought Collective. Rather than resting on broad generalities, he distinguishes between famed neoliberals to show how, for example, Milton Friedman and George Stigler approach their advocacy in very different ways.\n\nPhilip Mirowski is a contributor to Public Books.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
