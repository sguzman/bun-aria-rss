  "description": "On Tuesday’s Mark Levin show, President Trump’s National Security Adviser John Bolton calls in to discuss the administration’s decision to leave the U.N. Human Rights Council. The UNHRC has been manipulated and used by human rights abusers against the United States and Israel. This decision effectively reverses the posture of the Obama administration, which re-entered the UNHRC following a U.S. departure under the Bush administration. Today we struck a small blow for America by getting out of this council and this is not the last that we'll hear of the President defending US sovereignty. Then, Paul Manafort is being held in solitary confinement for his own safety, after Judge Burman-Jackson revoked his bail following witness tampering allegations by Special Counsel Mueller. This escalation in his treatment is no doubt another attempt to pressure Manafort into cooperating with Mueller, who was originally arrested when agents with guns drawn ripped him from his home on process crimes. Meanwhile, the border issue is not a human rights issue, this is a United States issue. The left had a chance to fix this and did nothing. The media had a chance to report on this in the past and did nothing. Walter Mondale, Latino groups, and labor unions used to go to the border to protect America against cheaper illegal labor and now they’ve flipped. They claim to be wrapped in compassion yet call a baby a choice! Later, Conservative Review Editor Daniel Horowitz weighs in immigration. Chuck Schumer is a pathetic fraud who started this whole policy that separated families to begin with. There's something called sovereignty and we control who comes into our country, so if Trump wanted to completely shut this down he could. Finally, Derek Hunter calls is to discuss his new book Outrage, inc.:How the Liberal Mob ruined Science, Journalism and Hollywood.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
