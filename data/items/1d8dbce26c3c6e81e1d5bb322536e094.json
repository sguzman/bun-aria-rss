    "media:description": "We just learned Gauss's law for the electric field, but wait, there's also Gauss's law for the magnetic field! This will help us better understand magnetic fields, obviously. And who doesn't want that? Again, if all the advanced calculus is too much to handle, visit the mathematics playlist for some review! Otherwise let's learn about how moving electric charges generate magnetic fields.\n\nWatch the whole Classical Physics playlist: http://bit.ly/ProfDavePhysics1\n\nModern Physics Tutorials: http://bit.ly/ProfDavePhysics2\nMathematics Tutorials: http://bit.ly/ProfDaveMaths\nGeneral Chemistry Tutorials: http://bit.ly/ProfDaveGenChem\nOrganic Chemistry Tutorials: http://bit.ly/ProfDaveOrgChem\nBiochemistry Tutorials: http://bit.ly/ProfDaveBiochem\nBiology Tutorials: http://bit.ly/ProfDaveBio\n\nEMAIL► ProfessorDaveExplains@gmail.com\nPATREON► http://patreon.com/ProfessorDaveExplains\n\nCheck out \"Is This Wi-Fi Organic?\", my book on disarming pseudoscience!\nAmazon: https://amzn.to/2HtNpVH\nBookshop: https://bit.ly/39cKADM\n&#13;Barnes and Noble: https://bit.ly/3pUjmrn \nBook Depository: http://bit.ly/3aOVDlT",
