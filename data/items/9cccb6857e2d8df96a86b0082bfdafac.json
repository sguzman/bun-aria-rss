That platform is playing a lot more with video. When I first started putting out content in 2006, it was video because that felt most natural to me. The best way I could communicate. But it was hard for me to execute on it. In 2007 and 2009, I would carry a Flip Cam around with me and use that as my main medium. The fact that I can now do that straight through the Twitter app is awesome. </span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">So video does seem most natural to me. But I don't over think my content. Way too many people over think the stuff they are putting out there. We're living in a culture where kids are growing up scrutinizing every selfie they take. It takes them forty-seven minutes to post because they have to make sure the lighting is right. Then when it doesn't get enough likes in the first four minutes, they pull it down. I have the reverse of that rigor. I would take the most unflattering selfies, not caring about the lighting (this is actually the first year I've started to understand lighting...).</span><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><br style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\" /><span style=\"color: #333333; font-family: arial, sans-serif; font-size: 13.5135135650635px; line-height: 17px;\">Bottom line: I really don't care about the angles.
