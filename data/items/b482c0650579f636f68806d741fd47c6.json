La La shares her career journey from radio personality to MTV VJ (hello, “Total Request Live”) to producer, actress, entrepreneur and activist. They touch upon the ups and downs of quarantine life, but also dive deep into the current state of social and racial unrest and its emotional toll. Although the country’s racial injustices are amplified now, it is a reality both women have dealt with their whole lives and now have to watch their children go through, too.

So we tell him ‘this at any moment could be you.’” It’s a deeply personal conversation about their struggles, as well as their hopes for what can change. “There’s still so much work to do,” La La says, “and you don’t stop just because a hashtag isn’t trending anymore.\" </p><p>For more, subscribe to Katie Couric’s morning newsletter, “Wake-Up Call,” at <a href=\"https://katiecouric.com/newsletter\">KatieCouric.com</a>.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
