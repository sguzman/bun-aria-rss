Most people know they should get more high-quality sleep, but they don’t really know where to start. But understanding the way our brain and neurotransmitters work means we can hack our sleep to not just feel amazing but to level up our focus, skills, and knowledge. And it’s not all about what happens at night, either—getting the right exposure to light at the right times has a profound impact on our circadian rhythms and the way our bodies transition to sleep.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>In today’s episode, I talk with Dr. Roger Seheult, Dhru Purohit, and Dr. Andrew Huberman about why optimizing your sleep should be prioritized and how you can get better sleep.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Roger Seheult is currently an associate clinical professor at the University of California, Riverside School of Medicine, and an assistant clinical professor at the School of Medicine and Allied Health at Loma Linda University. Dr. Seheult is quadruple board certified in Internal Medicine, Pulmonary Diseases, Critical Care Medicine, and Sleep Medicine through the American Board of Internal Medicine. He is also the cofounder of MedCram, an online medical education company that helps healthcare professionals and laypeople understand medical topics clearly.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dhru Purohit is a podcast host, serial entrepreneur, and investor in the health and wellness industry. His podcast, <em>The Dhru Purohit Podcast</em>, is a top 50 global health podcast with over 30 million unique downloads. His interviews focus on the inner workings of the brain and the body and feature the brightest minds in wellness, medicine, and mindset.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Dr. Andrew Huberman is a McKnight Foundation and Pew Foundation Fellow and was awarded the Cogan Award in 2017, which is given to the scientist making the largest discoveries in the study of vision. His lab’s most recent work focuses on the influence of vision and respiration on human performance and brain states such as fear and courage. Work from the Huberman Laboratory at Stanford University School of Medicine has been published in top journals including <em>Nature</em>, <em>Science</em>, and <em>Cell</em> and has been featured in <em>TIME</em>, BBC, <em>Scientific American</em>, <em>Discover</em>, and other top media outlets.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>This episode is brought to you by Rupa Health, ButcherBox, and Mitopure.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>You can check out a free, live demo with a Q&A or create an account at <a href=\"https://rupahealth.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">RupaHealth.com</a>.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>If you sign up at <a href=\"http://butcherbox.com/farmacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">butcherbox.com/farmacy</a>, ButcherBox will give you 2lbs of ground beef free for one whole year.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Get 10% off at <a href=\"http://timelinenutrition.com/drhyman\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">timelinenutrition.com/drhyman</a> and use code DRHYMAN10 at checkout.</p><p>&nbsp;</p><p>Full-length episodes of these interviews can be found here:</p><p><a href=\"https://drhyman.com/blog/2022/03/16/podcast-ep509/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Roger Seheult</a></p><p><a href=\"https://drhyman.com/blog/2022/01/28/podcast-ep487/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dhru Purohit</a></p><p><a href=\"https://drhyman.com/blog/2021/07/07/podcast-178/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Dr. Andrew Huberman</a></p><p><br></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
