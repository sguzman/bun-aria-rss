  "description": "<p>May 27, 2011. Highland Township, Michigan. Bernie Pyne and his 10 year old daughter, Julia, returned home to discover Ruth Pyne murdered. The wife and mother, 51, was beaten and stabbed to death. Detectives first looked at Bernie but after the investigation was well under way, a new suspect emerged; 21 year old Jeffrey Pyne. By his own admission, he had been home right around the time that the crime likely occurred. But did Jeffrey really kill his mother? What would his motive have been? Police had been called to the family home in the past after Ruth had attacked her son. She had not been taking her prescription regularly to manage her bipolar disorder. Could things have escalated between the two of them once again? Or was someone else responsible for killing Ruth? </p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
