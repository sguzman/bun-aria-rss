  "description": "<p>Entanglement entropy (EE) of a state is a measure of correlation or\nentanglement between two parts of a composite system and it may show\nappreciable change when the ground state (GS) undergoes a qualitative change in\na quantum phase transition (QPT). Therefore, the EE has been extensively used\nto characterise the QPT in various correlated Hamiltonians. Similarly fidelity\nalso shows sharp changes at a QPT. We characterized the QPT of frustrated\nantiferromagnetic Heisenberg spin-1/2 systems on 3/4, 3/5 and 5/7 skewed\nladders using the EE and fidelity analysis. It is noted that all the\nnon-magnetic to magnetic QPT boundary in these systems can be accurately\ndetermined using the EE and fidelity, and the EE exhibits a discontinuous\nchange, whereas fidelity shows a sharp dip at the transition points. It is also\nnoted that in case of the degenerate GS, the unsymmetrized calculations show\nwild fluctuations in the EE and fidelity even without actual phase transition,\nhowever, this problem is resolved by calculating the EE and the fidelity in the\nlowest energy state of the symmetry subspaces, to which the degenerate states\nbelong.\n</p>",
