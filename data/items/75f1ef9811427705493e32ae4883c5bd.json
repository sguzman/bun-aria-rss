  "description": "<p>Meditation: Cultivating a Clear and Relaxed Presence (2018-04-25) - This guided meditation begins with a calming breath to quiet the mind and relax the body. Following this, we establish our presence with an anchor - the breath, sound or sensation - and practice “coming back” from distractions, and including whatever direct experience asks for our kind attention. The meditation ends with a short loving kindness prayer.</p> <p>Free download of Tara's 10 min meditation: \"Mindful Breathing: Finding Calm and Ease\" when you <a href=\"http://eepurl.com/6YfI\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">join her email list</a>.</p>",
