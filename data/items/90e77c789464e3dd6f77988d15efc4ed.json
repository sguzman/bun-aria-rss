  "description": "<p>On average, housing costs easily account for a third of our monthly expenses. That’s why it’s so important for us to cover how we can cut housing costs to zero, and even make some money while we’re at it! Here to tell us how she did it is Zeona McIntyre. Zeona went from earning minimum wage to becoming financially free in two years with real estate- specifically with Airbnb. Zeona now owns 7 properties and manages 20, all over the world. She also consults by working with her clients and helping them achieve their short-term rental goals: from finding an ideal rental property to purchase, tips on furnishing, all the way through to management. Zeona is using real estate to design the kind of life she wants to live, and hopefully after this interview you’ll be inspired to do the same.</p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Chocolate Peanut Butter Porter by Lupulin Brewing!
