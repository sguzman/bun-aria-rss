  "title": "#351: The Surprising Power of a \"Useless\" Liberal Arts Education",
  "description": "<p>We’ve all heard the jokes about useless liberal arts degrees, but my guest today argues that in today’s high tech economy, liberal arts degrees can be incredibly useful and even lucrative. His name is George Anders and he’s the author of the book \"You Can Do Anything: The Surprising Power of a 'Useless' Liberal Arts Education.\" We begin our conversation looking at research that suggests that the jobs that pay the most money and are in the most demand today require a liberal arts background, and not necessarily a STEM degree. He then goes on to highlight research that shows how most of the jobs being created today aren’t in computer programming or engineering, but rather in jobs that support those fields like sales, management, and consulting. George then argues that individuals with a liberal arts background are in a killer position to fill those jobs. <br />We then discuss the perils of liberal arts degrees and what individuals who've earned them can do to market themselves and take control of their careers.</p>\n",
