  "description": "<p>In this episode, John looks at the bleak future for Sam Darnold with the Jets, why he could be gone sooner than later, why the Steelers/Titans will push through despite their game being postponed due to positive COVID tests, why Aaron Rodgers' pretending his headset isn't working in order to call is own play isn't necessarily a bad thing, why Carson Wentz and Doug Pederson will sink or swim together in Philly, the lack of accountability from no fans in the stands, and why he's so impressed with Nick Saban's ability to adapt and transform Alabama's identity from defense to wide open offense. Middlekauff also gives his 3 for the $ Week 4 ATS picks after a 6-3 start to the season, and answers listener questions in the Middlekauff Mailbag.
