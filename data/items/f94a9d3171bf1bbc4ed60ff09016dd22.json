    "media:description": "To celebrate reaching 100,000 subscribers I've tried to make a sequel to the most popular video on Maths Town: \"The Hardest Trip\".  Same colouring, same music artist, a bit deeper, and a few less iterations. \n\nThanks to everyone who has supported the channel over the last few year. 100,000 subscribers is a huge milestone for such a niche channel!  Your support is most appreciated!\n\nAs usual, presented with mid-roll ads disabled so you can simply enjoy.\n\nThank-you to my supporters on Patreon.\n\nThis video will be available for Patreons to download in the coming days, which will have a higher bitrate.  You can also use these visuals on your own channel if you are a member of my Patreon page. https://www.patreon.com/mathstown\n\n/********************************************************************************\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/mathstown (Support, Downloads & Usage Rights)\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/MathsTown\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/YphYVt787v (Drop by and say hello)\nWebsite: https://www.maths.town\n********************************************************************************/\n\nMusic from Epidemic Sound: https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/ekoiev/\n\n#Mandelbrot #fractal #mathstown #fractals",
