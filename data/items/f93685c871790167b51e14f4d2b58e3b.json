  "description": "<p>The Suns are no longer going to win in 4 (00:02:49 - 00:07:19). Trae Young is going to take the Hawks all the way? (00:07:19 - 00:22:01) The boys went to the Nassau Coliseum and saved the Islanders season plus a review of the old barn. The Canadiens get into the Stanley Cup Final (00:22:01 - 00:36:12). Jay Williams had the worst tweet of all time and it wasn't even his original terrible tweet (00:36:12 - 00:46:23). Paul Rabil joins the show to talk PLL, Waterdogs, and how Lacrosse is going to the next level (00:46:23 - 01:26:37). We finish the show with Fyre Fest of the week and Billy's recap.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
