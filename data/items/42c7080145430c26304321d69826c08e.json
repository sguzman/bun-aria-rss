  "description": "<p>Samuel Hammond is returning to the podcast today to discuss the relationship between capitalism and social justice.</p> <p>Sam was prompted to <a href= \"https://www.liberalcurrents.com/pepsi-justice/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">write about this</a> by an <a href= \"https://www.nytimes.com/2017/04/05/business/kendall-jenner-pepsi-ad.html\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">insensitive Pepsi commercial</a> that caused some controversy in April 2017.</p> <p>The controversial ad featured generic protesters and Kendall Jenner sharing a Pepsi with police. While the ad was insensitive and more than a little absurd, Sam pointed out that Pepsi has a history of promoting social justice and racial harmony through its marketing.</p> <p>Back in 1940, Pepsi was a small player compared to Coca-Cola; the latter selling 25 sodas for each one Pepsi sold. In order to compete, Pepsi's CEO Walter S. Mack Jr. decided to do something the other companies weren't doing: marketing specifically to African Americans:</p> <blockquote>\"In 1947, [Mack Jr.] hired Edward F. Boyd, an African-American adman who later became known as one of the fathers of niche-marketing. Boyd crafted ads for Pepsi that celebrated black cultural and professional achievements, and above all portrayed African-Americans as normal, middle-class consumers. It was this marketing push that ultimately drove Pepsi’s rise to the number two soda company in America.\"</blockquote> <p>In pre-civil-rights America, this was a major achievement, and it served a deeper social purpose by extending social recognition to black Americans.</p> <p>We also discuss some other interesting niche marketing campaigns, like Subaru's marketing strategy <a href= \"https://priceonomics.com/how-an-ad-campaign-made-lesbians-fall-in-love-with/\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">targeting lesbians</a> in the 1990s. Finally, we tie it all back to capitalism as a force promoting diversity and inclusion, with references to Becker's work on taste-based discrimination.</p> <hr /> <p> </p>",
