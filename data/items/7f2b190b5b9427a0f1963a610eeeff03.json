  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys have a legendary conversation with 6x Major Champion, 45x winner on the PGA Tour, 2012 World Golf Hall of Fame Inductee, one of the greatest golfers of all-time, Phil Mickelson. Pat and Phil chat about his involvement with the match and why he wanted to start doing it, what he's learned from Tom Brady, how he learned to hit the crazy flop shots that he does so often, his mindset going into tournaments, how his coffee basically saved his wife, why he thinks he can continue to play well for many years to come, what he's working on currently, his thoughts on Bryson Dechambeau and Brooks Koepka's rivalry, and much more (9:39-40:50). Later, Pat and AJ Hawk jump around the NFL training camps and talk about tomorrow night's Hall of Fame game between the Steelers and the Cowboys, if they're going to bet on it, news from Carolina that the Panthers are keeping an eye on the Deshaun Watson situation and may still be interested in acquiring him, fallout from the Giants fight yesterday at camp, and everything else pertinent in the NFL and sports world (40:53-1:52:37).
