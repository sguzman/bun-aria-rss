  "title": "#130: Coerced Consensus (Bret Weinstein & Heather Heying DarkHorse Livestream)",
  "description": "<p>In this 130th in a series of live discussions with Bret Weinstein and Heather Heying (both PhDs in Biology), we discuss the state of the world through an evolutionary lens.</p><p> </p><p>This week, we discuss the state of Portland, Oregon, two years after protests and riots made a mess of the city. Still found on the streets: entreaties to abolish the police, and protect “black trans sex workers,” and to attend a pride brunch that is actually a “drag queen brunch.” And yet when you talk to people, you almost invariably find that the veneer on the surface is not what it seems. Few people seem to agree with the coerced consensus: that letting people camp and shoot up and defecate on sidewalks is being compassionate to them; or that men can become women. We discuss whether a minority’s self-declared rights should be allowed to infringe on already established rights of others. And we discuss the self-assembly of rackets to fill niches—such as Covid testing centers that are both lucrative for those running them, and mandatory to participate in activities like international travel, and camp.</p><p> </p><p>*****</p><p> </p><p>Our book, A Hunter-Gatherer’s Guide to the 21st Century, is available everywhere books are sold, and signed copies are available here: <a href='https://darvillsbookstore.indielite.org'>https://darvillsbookstore.indielite.org</a></p><p> </p><p>Check out our store!
