Meanwhile, mainstream media continues to slowly back away from the Biden dumpster fire. Bubba is back from his root canal and Speedy updates us on the scorchingly hot golf tournament he attended after Bubba \"had to miss it.\" A robot stunt show goes badly at Disney. Also, we debate which \"Rocky\" movie is the best.\nSponsor: RealEstateAgentsITrust.com - Buying or selling a home is already one of the most stressful things you can do – and it can be ten times worse if you’re not working with the right agent.
