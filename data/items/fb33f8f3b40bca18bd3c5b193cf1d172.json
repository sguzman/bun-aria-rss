But what exactly is that reason?</p><p>Today’s guest became obsessed with better understanding what differentiates those who prevail from those who fail. What he discovered would forever change the game.</p><p>Rich Diviney&nbsp;is a former Navy SEAL Commander who&nbsp;served up 13 overseas deployments over 21 years as an active member and officer of the armed forces’ most elite, secretive group. A group that shall remain unnamed—but one I suspect you might quickly surmise.</p><p>Throughout his career, Rich was intimately involved in a specialized SEAL selection process, which whittled a group of hundreds of extraordinary SpecOps candidates down to a handful of the most elite performers. Oddly, which candidates washed out and which succeeded was often wildly unpredictable. Some could have all the right skills and still fail. Others more easily dismissible would ironically prove to be top performers. The seemingly objective criteria weren’t telling him what he most needed to know:&nbsp;<em>who would succeed in one of the world’s toughest military assignments?</em></p><p>Over time, Rich began to see that beneath obvious skills are&nbsp;<em>hidden drivers of performance,</em>surprising core attributes—including cunning, adaptability, courage, even narcissism—that determine how resilient or perseverant we are, how situationally aware and how conscientious. This epiphany evolved into&nbsp;a SpecOps training program called&nbsp;MindGym—the first of its kind scientifically devised to help elite soldiers perform faster, longer, and better in all environments—especially high-stress ones.</p><p>In his new book,&nbsp;<strong><em>The Attributes:&nbsp;25 Hidden Drivers of Optimal Performance</em></strong><em>,</em>&nbsp;Rich defines and examines these various attributes to explain how we perform as individuals and as part of a team. As you may suspect, his military methodology is equally applicable to our personal and professional lives. Understanding the valence of one’s attributes not only promotes greater self-awareness, it provides a guiding rubric to train the characteristics that predict optimal performance in any situation—from parenting and sports to business and relationships.</p><p>Diviney currently works as a speaker, facilitator, and consultant with the Chapman & Co.
