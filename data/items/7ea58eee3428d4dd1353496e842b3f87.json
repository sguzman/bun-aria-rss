Last explains that although remaining optimistic with regards to the legitimacy of the SCOTUS, he is ultimately losing faith that some voters care not for a system of governance that is capable of functioning competently. Then, we listen to Mike’s Monday Spiel on a similar theme.\n\nProduced by Joel Patterson and Corey Wara\nEmail us at thegist@mikepesca.com\nTo advertise on the show, visit: https://advertisecast.com/TheGist\n \nLearn more about your ad choices.
