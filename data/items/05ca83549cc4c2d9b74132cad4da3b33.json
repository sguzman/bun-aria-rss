Against all odds, But soon against ourselves. \nYou haunted every memory\nWith no goodbyes, all bad for me\nYour pride put out the fire in our flames\nThen just one look is all it takes\nI feel your eyes they’re locked on every part of me\nThen my dumb heart says... \n\nJust look up\nThere is no place to hide... \nTrue love doesn’t die, it holds on tight and never lets you go\nJust look up! \nYou cannot deny the signs...\nWhat you’ve waited for, don’t wait no more. \nIt’s right up above you. Just look up! \n\n(Baby) Know I let you down a n---- can’t deny it (Uh uh) \nAnd there’s so much I could lose and yes that matters (yeah) \nI’ve been dealing with madness (yo) \nWasn’t the man you needed\nYou dealing with sadness\nTruthfully it’s all on me \nAnd I’m sorry my love Imma heal your heart \nI’ll hold it in my hand\nTime is ohh so precious, we don’t really have much left now  \nTake my hand baby Never leave you Riley \n\nLook up\nWhat he’s really trying to say\nIs get your head out of your ass\nAnd listen to the goddamn qualified scientists\nWe really fucked it up, fucked it up this time\nIt’s so close I can feel the heat big time\nYou can act like everything is alright\nbut this is probably happening in real time\n\nCelebrate, Or cry or pray ...\nWhatever it takes to get you through the mess that we made! \nCause, tomorrow may never come! \n\nJust look up\nTurn off that shit box news\nCause you’re about to die soon everybody! \nLook up\nHere it comes\nI’m so glad I’m here with you \nForever in your arms\n\n#ArianaGrande #KIdCudi #JustLookUp #DontLookUp\n\n\nMusic video by Ariana Grande, Kid Cudi performing Just Look Up (From Don’t Look Up) (Lyric Video). © 2021 Republic Records, a division of UMG Recordings, Inc.",
