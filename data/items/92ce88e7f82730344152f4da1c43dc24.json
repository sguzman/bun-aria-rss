  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, Amy Coney Barrett is confirmed as Supreme Court Justice without a single Democrat vote, creating another precedent towards destroying the Supreme Court. While the leftist Democrats lie and say that Barrett’s confirmation was rushed there are plenty of historical examples of confirmations that occurred in just days and some being confirmed on the same day they were nominated. Not a single President has ever abdicated their responsibility to nominate in an election year when a vacancy has occurred at the end of their term. The Constitution limits the power of the federal government so that the individual is empowered by their God-given rights. Then, despite their three million dollar home, the Biden’s gave an average of $369 to charity, according to USA Today in 2008. Later, President Trump will go down in history as one of the greatest presidents and the idea that the American people will cut his time short is a shocking possibility. Afterward, US House candidate Madison Cawthorn calls in with an update on his campaign for North Carolina's 11th congressional district. Cawthorn also invited the nation to pray for the upcoming election.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
