  "description": "Silence comes in lots of different forms. In fact, says writer Paul Goodman, there are several kinds: There's the noisy silence of \"resentment and self-recrimination,\" and the helpful, participatory silence of actively listening to someone speak.

Plus millers, keysmash, subpar, placer mining, dinklepink and padiddle, machatunim and consuegros, and to clock someone.\n Read full show notes, hear hundreds of free episodes, send your thoughts and questions, and learn more on the A Way with Words website: https://waywordradio.org/.
