  "description": "<div>The boys chop it up about Michael's new favorite porn and dudes that jerk off at the library before getting in to a conversation about how to handle critical people on the internet and when to just block someone. Plus a listener writes in about foot underwear, so you know 2fine has opinions. This is still a science podcast.<br>\n<br>\nThanks to Hawthorne for sponsoring this episode.
