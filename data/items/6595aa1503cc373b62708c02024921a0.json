  "description": "<p>I’ve been blessed to have had tremendous mentors and great experiences throughout my life. I believe that success leaves clues. I’ve learned from a lot of my mistakes and a few of my successes. I’ve had the privilege to be interviewed on hundreds of programs. I wanted to distill them down to 10 strategies for a blissful, successful and fulfilled life. These 10 Keys are some of the rules, ideals and beliefs I’ve taken away from these life experiences and now live by religiously. Take a listen, and write some notes down because these are things you can implement NOW, to change your life FOREVER.</p>\n",
