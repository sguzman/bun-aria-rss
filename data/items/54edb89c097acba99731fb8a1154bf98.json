  "description": "<p>Does Electrical Play make you come like a rocket? Traveler & beloved storyteller Soren Berg returns to Burning Man to be part of Shots and Shocks (you know, do a shot of liquor, get zapped by a cattle prod) and he’s anxious; electricity is not really his thing, but his date Daisy is intrigued. Yet when Captain Weak-knees invites them to the ElectroDome for a 2 AM private party, their new guide teaches them how to use electrical current to tease and torture each other.
