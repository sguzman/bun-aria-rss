  "description": "In today's podcast we hear about trends in phishing, ransomware, and distributed denial-of-service—and none of those trends are particularly good. We hear why some ransomware may keep coming back after it's been removed. US bank regulators warn financial institutions to mind their security manners in the wake of the SWIFT-related fraudulent transfers, and investigation into the Bangladesh Bank hack still point toward Pyongyang (with a slight nod in the direction of Shanghai. The FBI is actively stinging potential jihadists, and Singapore gets ready to wean its civil servants from the Internet at work. And we welcome our newest research partner, Dr. Charles Clancy from Virginia Tech's Hume Center.",
