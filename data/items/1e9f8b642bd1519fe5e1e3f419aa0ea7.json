  "title": "#181: At The Mall Talking About Kim Richards",
  "description": "<p>Audiophiles, be warned: we decided to take a field trip to the Glendale Galleria mall today so that we could mix people watching into our usual shady recapping. And boy did we see a lot. For the first hour, Ben Mandelker (@banterblender) and Ronnie Karam (trashtalktv.com) are joined by Angie Thomas (The Lyon's Lair podcast) to discuss Kim Richards' crazy appearance on \"Dr. Phil.\" Was this the intervention we've been waiting for? Then it's on to the \"Real Housewives of New York City\" where we question Bethenny Frankel's social etiquette. At this point, the laptop dies; so we pick up again in the car (real professional) and finish up the podcast with rants about \"Shahs of Sunset\" and \" Southern Charm\" (with occasional commentary about various people we see on the street). It's a classy show.
