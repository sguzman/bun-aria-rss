Do we have another event MCU film with the Fox characters (X-Men, Fantastic Four, etc.) make their big debuts? Plus Chris shares his thoughts on the latest AMC Feature Drink, ‘The Sorcerer’. Then, CageFest continues with the I’m-not-sure-what-it-is-supposed-to-be ‘Kill Chain’, a Nic Cage movie that has a rather large dearth of Nic Cage. As always, there’s the breakdown the Physical Media releases, featuring the Straight To DVD and Streaming Picks of the Week.
