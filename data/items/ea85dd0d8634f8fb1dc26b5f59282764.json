  "description": "<p><p>Round 1: A British soldier is going to jail for six months for...you guessed it, purple nurples.</p><p>Round 2: The Iwo Jima flag raising is one of the most iconic images in history. The people credited for being in that photo recently changed. That changes the legacy of some families. </p><p>Round 3: There's lots of aspects that we miss about being in the military. Having to use military bathrooms isnt one. It's not that they arent clean. They are. It's that the smell of 15 Marines taking tequila shits will change your life forever. </p><p>Round 4: New Zealand's Navy will allow male sailors to wear fake eyelashes, nail polish, and make-up and I'm jealous as hell because my eyes would have popped even more in dress blues. </p><p>Round 5: The United States has the 2nd largest nuclear arsenal in the world. We controlled those bad boys with the greatest technology that the world has even seen. Just kidding. We used and are using floppy disks!</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
