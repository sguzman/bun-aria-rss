And those sudden superpowers can be a boon when you’re running from a lion. But repeatedly dipping into that well can make you sick, even kill you. Since it feels like there’s been an extra bit of stress going around lately, we decided to replay this episode, originally aired back in 2005, which takes a long hard look at the body's system for getting out of trouble. And how in our modern, hyper-connected world, that system misfires and takes us from the frying pan, right into another, albeit entirely different, frying pan.</p>\n<p>Stanford University neurologist (and part-time \"baboonologist\") Dr. Robert Sapolsky takes us through what happens on our insides when we stand in the wrong line at the supermarket, and offers a few coping strategies: gnawing on wood, beating the crap out of somebody, and having friends. Plus: the story of a singer who lost her voice, and an author stuck in a body that never grew up.</p>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n</div>\n<div id=\"ember1101\" class=\"story-credits ember-view\">\n<div class=\"story-credits__appearance-credits\"><em>Support Radiolab by becoming a member of<span> </span><a href=\"https://www.wnycstudios.org/podcasts/radiolab/membership\"><strong>The Lab</strong></a><span> </span>today.    </em></div>\n<div class=\"story-credits__producing-org-credits producing-org-credits\">\n<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCaum_fMDGgFQCmKHUBPq_xg\"><strong>Radiolab is on YouTube!</strong></a><span> </span><span>Catch up with new episodes and hear classics from our archive.
