  "description": "The best way to describe a great interview is with an analogy. Imagine yourself at a restaurant, and the table next to you is having the most incredible conversation. And all the while, you're listening and quietly taking in all the great information that is going back and forth. Now imagine it with four guys talking hoops and breaking down some of the most intricate basketball info you've ever heard. Oh and one more thing... one of those guys is a recently retired 15 year NBA veteran who has seen and heard it all, and another one just happens to be one of the best basketball players on the entire planet. Yep, that's today's episode on the OM3 as JJ and Tommy join forces with The ETC's podcast, which is hosted by Kevin Durant and Eddy Gonzalez, for an absurd hoops conversation that is loaded with unique and personal basketball info. It's an outstanding listen from start to finish.\nTo learn more about listener data and our privacy practices visit: https://www.audacyinc.com/privacy-policy\nLearn more about your ad choices.
