  "title": "267 - Doctor Satan: The Insane Story of Serial Killer Marcel Petiot",
  "description": "<p>Happy Halloween! This episode feels appropriately dark enough for Halloween week. French serial killer Marcel Petiot was an evil genius. A master manipulator. And the greatest scam artist we've covered here so far. He likely lied his way into a medical degree. He ended up working at a psychiatric hospital  when he was supposed to be a patient. He collected 100% disability payments while working full time as a doctor while also double charging his patients. He built his practice up by slandering other doctors. He became mayor by sabotaging an opponent's campaign. And he may be France's most prolific serial killer. While he was charged with 27 murders, he killed an unknown amount of people by fabricating a French resistance group during Nazi occupation and tricking people into paying him to help them start new lives in Argentina. But they only ended up in  his murder mansion. Anything else I give away will just spoil this episode! So many twists and turns. So much, \"how could this have happened???\" This story is a wild one - hope you love it!<br /><br />Thanks to Bad Magic Patreon supporters, we'll be donating somewhere around $15,600 this month to RAINN - the Rape, Abuse & Incest National Network - America's largest anti-sexual violence organization.
