  "description": "<p>Greg Barnett has been an NFL agent for 15 years. Some of the current players that he represents are Justin Houston, Reshad Jones, and Pro-bowler Kyler Fuller. He also co-represents this year’s #4 draft pick Clelin Ferrell and former Heisman trophy winner Jameis Winston. His journey has taken him from being in special education in high school to becoming a school teacher, to making NFL history. In 2015 he helped negotiate the largest contract for a linebacker in NFL history at that time for Justin Houston. The contract was for $101,000,000 with $52,000,000 of it guaranteed. In addition to being an agent, he also is an entrepreneur, investor, and manager for retired players including the legendary Percy Harvin. In episode 47 he walked us through NFL contract negotiations, he explained what college athletes go through, and we talked about the NCAA not paying athletes. We also discussed special education in schools, the business of AAU basketball, and the advantages of HBCUs.
