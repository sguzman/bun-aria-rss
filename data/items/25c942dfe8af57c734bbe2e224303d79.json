  "description": "<p>How do we know Jesus isn’t just a great human king or one of many angelic beings? The Gospel of Mark tells us that Jesus is the anointed King, the Son of God. This passage shows us three things about Jesus the King: 1) The King has come (who he is); 2) The King’s school (how you can meet him in the wilderness); and 3) The King’s cross (where he’s going).</p>\n<p>This sermon was preached by Dr. Timothy Keller at Redeemer Presbyterian Church on January 8, 2006. Series: King's Cross: The Gospel of Mark, Part 1: The Coming of the King. Scripture: Mark 1:1-8.</p>\n<p>Today's podcast is brought to you by Gospel in Life, the site for all sermons, books, study guides and resources from Timothy Keller and Redeemer Presbyterian Church.
