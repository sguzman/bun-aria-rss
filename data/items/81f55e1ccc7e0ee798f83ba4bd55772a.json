  "description": "A surprise guest defeats Si in a battle of skill, and then in true Duck Call Room fashion, she rubs it in. But first, Si and John-David bond over playing \"Tiger Woods PGA Tour\" on Playstation, and Si has a message for a fan who measured how many times he says \"hey\" and \"no.\" Stone installs a canopy on his boat to protect Si, and Martin remembers the time Si burned his legs to a crisp in the Bahamas. The boys also tackle how to pronounce \"crappie\" the right way, why there are too many cities in the city of Dallas (not a typo), and what their favorite shotguns are.\n-\nLearn more about your ad choices.
