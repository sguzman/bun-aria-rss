  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I attended skateboarder and standup comedian Dave Chappelle’s screening of his movie at Madison Square Garden. And MAN! What a show. I really thought it was just going to be a movie screening. But why would I expect that for $100+ per ticket? No, Chappelle put on a show. Comedians, musicians, Jeff Ross. Folks!</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">I wish you all could’ve been there. It was a really fun night. Please make sure to watch Dave Chappelle on Netflix today. He needs the views. And also watch my special on Netflix, Double Negative. It’s not 2 specials like Dave’s, it’s a double special. </span></p> <p><strong>For more Ari:</strong></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href= \"http://www.arishaffir.com/tour/\">Tour Dates</a></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> <a href= \"https://www.patreon.com/arishaffir\">Patreon</a></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href= \"https://bit.ly/arimerch\">Merch</a></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><a href= \"https://www.instagram.com/arishaffir/\">Instagram</a></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">The Music:</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Tobe Nwigwe- I'M DOPE</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">H.E.R ft.
