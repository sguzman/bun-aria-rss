Another not so astronomically terrible game but instead a disappointing end result for many fans. Biomutant is a Kung Fu fable set in a post apocalyptic world which is ruled by rodents. \n\nThere is so much to do in Biomutant but a lot of it feels basic and the game overall becomes quite repetitive. Questing is most just fetch this talk to that. Combat is easy to cheese with kiting even though it's quite comprehensive with all the unique move sets to unlock. It's kind of unbalanced, you'll become too powerful early on so most of the loot you find is useless. And so on.\n\nIs Biomutant worth it in 2022? It's not necessarily a bad game, it's just a bit lacklustre and was clearly an ambitious project from the start. I expected more from a game with a triple A price tag.\n\n0:00 - Intro\n0:31 - What is Biomutant?\n2:20 - Development\n17:21 - Review",
