  "description": "<p>1 out of every 4 women experiences a miscarriage (in our case, 2 out of 3!). It's WAY more common than you think. This topic is somewhat taboo, but not here.

We are also answering YOUR questions on the subject: what to say to someone who has had a miscarriage, how to be there for them, what to expect, when can you start trying again?</p>",
