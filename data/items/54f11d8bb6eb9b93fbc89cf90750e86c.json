  "description": "Yes, Elon… Sanders is still alive. If you haven’t heard the latest drama surrounding Tesla CEO Elon Musk’s Twitter account, he and Senator Bernie Sanders exchanged jabs this week over the two things humans can’t escape: death and taxes. Daniel and I share a laugh over the spat. [1:06] The end of earnings season means the release of 13Fs... where the largest money managers disclose what they bought and sold during the previous quarter. As Peloton shares tumbled this quarter, Viking Global—a popular hedge fund—scooped up millions of shares… We speculate whether it’s already unloaded shares for a loss. [4:20] 13Fs can be a great place to find new ideas… Daniel highlights a couple of new names he discovered that he’s now digging into… And I point out what caught my attention in big tech. [11:18] The price of bitcoin dropped 10% overnight... and other cryptos are following suit. Here’s the best way for investors to handle the volatility… (It’s how we manage our Crypto Intelligence portfolio, which currently holds 5 quadruple-digit winners.) [21:51] Finally, I explain why Luke Downey’s Big Money Trader—launching today!—is the easiest way to maximize your returns on the best growth opportunities in the market.
