  "description": "<p>Today we talk about Vietnam. Do you know how the Vietnam war began? What events really led up to it? You will after this episode. You'll learn about centuries of foreign occupation at the hands of the Chinese and the French, and how colonial oppression led to a willingness to accept communist ideology. Communism may not be fun, but neither is being ruled by the French. We go over battles and the American counterculture's response to the battles. A LOT of info packed into this one.
