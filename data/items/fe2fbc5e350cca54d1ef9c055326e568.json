  "description": "<p>We continue Season 2 of Architecture, Design & Photography with a sit down interview with Painter & Muralist Ryan Adams. Ryan's background in traditional graffiti led him to creating large-scale mural work and hand lettered design and signage. His signature ‘gem’ style of work is a geometric breakdown of letter-forms with shadows and highlights included to create depth and movement throughout the pieces. His pieces tend to be bold, colorful and clever; often including statements within. Currently, Ryan co-owns and operates a hand painted signage business, designs for a brewery, paints murals any and everywhere and exhibits his work as often as possible. </p><p>More from Ryan Adams: </p><p>Website: <a href=\"http://ryanwritesonthings.com \">http://ryanwritesonthings.com </a></p><p>Instagram: <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/ryanwritesonthings \">http://www.instagram.com/ryanwritesonthings </a></p><p>This episode of ADP is sponsored by Maine Home + Design</p>\n",
