  "description": "<p>There are many different types of snow. From the fluffy to the slushy, this slippery frozen stuff comes in all different shapes and sizes. </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>From a distance, snowflakes may all look the same, but they are not. In fact, there are lots of different shapes of snowflakes — not just those classic shapes you might try to replicate with paper cut-outs.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>In this episode, Dr. Ken Libbrecht answers all of our snowflake questions: How are snowflakes made? Why are they different shapes? How is it that they’re all unique? And how does a scientist who lives in southern California study snow? And, he also lets us in on his brush with a couple Arendelle princesses.</p>\n<p></p>\n<p>Plus our pal Ruby Guthrie pays her local ski slope to visit a snow-making machine called “Kevin.” And of course, there’s a new Mystery Sound to warm your ears.</p>\n<p><br>If you’re looking for some fun snowflake activities to do at home, <a href=\"http://www.snowcrystals.com/activities/activities.html\">Ken’s provided this great list</a> — and you don’t need to live in a cold climate for all of them: http://www.snowcrystals.com/activities/activities.html </p>\n<p></p>\n<p>This episode was sponsored by:</p>\n<p>Shopify (<a href=\"https://shopify.com/brainson\" class=\"default\">Shopify.com/brainson</a>)</p>\n<p>Indeed (<a href=\"https://indeed.com/brainson\" class=\"default\">Indeed.com/BRAINSON</a>)</p>\n<p>Interlochen Center for the Arts (<a href=\"https://interlochen.org/brainson\" class=\"default\">Interlochen.org/brainson</a>)</p>\n",
