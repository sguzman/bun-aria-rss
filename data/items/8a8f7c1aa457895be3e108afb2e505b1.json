  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">89-year-old Dr. John Perkins has a lot to say to Christians about race, friendship, and the power of God’s love. The civil rights legend talks with Skye about his remarkable life, the problem with everyone focusing on their victimhood, and how “real reconciliation is washing each other’s wounds.” Also this week: John MacArthur tells Beth Moore to “Go home.” His audience laughed; Christian-twitter did not. Phil and Skye debate whether MacArthur even matters anymore. New Pew data says the U.S. will be majority non-Christian by 2035. Plus, the world’s largest ouija board debuts in Salem, Massachusetts.</p>",
