  "description": "The Smurl family claims that they were tormented by a demonic presence in their home for 13 years. Black masses would materialize before them, loud banging and scratching in the walls would keep them up at night, and a succubus with the head of a young woman and the body of an old lady covered in scales did the unthinkable. The Smurls and famed demonologist and clairvoyant Ed and Lorraine Warren claim their horrifying stories are true. However many believe this was the product of untreated health conditions or just an elaborate hoax for fame and fortune. You be the judge.\nSupport Sinisterhood\nLearn more about your ad choices.
