  "description": "The “great separation” is starting… and if you’re not paying attention to it… you’re at risk... But first, I’m humbled and grateful that so many of you took advantage of our Crypto Intelligence special offer. Members: Expect a new recommendation to hit your inbox tomorrow! [0:34] I hope you had a great Halloween. Ours was amazing… with tons of families out trick-or-treating in my neighborhood. It was like it’s supposed to be. [2:20] Turning to the markets… The major indices are hitting record highs as earnings season winds down. I share what stood out the most as I went through the latest results. And I break down the “great separation” I’m seeing in certain industries. [7:40] It’s been over 18 months since the COVID lows… and the markets are starting a new chapter. I point out several examples of the “great separation” across industries... including the opposite paths that Intel and AMD are taking… as well as Under Armour and Nike. Plus, I share why Amazon will continue to dominate (even though it pulled back after earnings). [14:10] Speaking of great companies, a listener wants my thoughts on tech giant Nvidia ahead of its earnings report. [19:50] Our last question comes from an older investor who’s getting into crypto… and wants to know about taxable gains. I dig into the details a bit… and explain why stable coins can be especially useful when you’re juggling different trading platforms. [27:36] Enjoyed this episode?
