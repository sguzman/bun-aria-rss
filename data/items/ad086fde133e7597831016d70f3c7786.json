  "description": "Today, instead of discussing a new book, I am convening a “New Books in African American Studies Roundtable” to talk with two historians early in their careers about their recent transitions from graduate school into the professorate, and some of the scholarly and public projects they are developing at their respective institutions: Dr. Robert Greene II, Assistant Professor in History at Claflin University, and Dr. Tyler D. Parry, Assistant Professor of African American and African Diaspora Studies at the University of Nevada-Las Vegas. Both Drs. Greene and Parry are incredible examples of what scholarly integrity and kindness are. They also both are graduates of the University of South Carolina’s doctorate program in history!\nAdam McNeil is a 2nd year PhD in Early African American history at Rutgers University-New Brunswick.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
