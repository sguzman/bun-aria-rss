His teaching and research cover many areas of Roman history and Latin literature, with a special focus on the fall of the Roman Republic. Josiah’s interest in the fall of the Roman empire began in high school Latin class, where he read Cicero’s speeches against Catiline. He found Cicero’s rhetoric so powerful that he became enthralled by Roman politics and has been studying the subject compulsively for twenty years since. He is the author of several books, including a translated edition of Suetonius, entitled How To Be A Bad Emperor, which looks at some of the worst Roman Emperors, and his most recent translation of Sallust’s The War with Catiline―a brief, powerful book that has influenced how generations of readers, including America’s founders, have thought about coups and political conspiracies.</p><p><a href='https://insidetracker.com/STOIC'>InsideTracker</a> provides you with a personalized plan to improve your metabolism, reduce stress, improve sleep, and optimize your health for the long haul.
