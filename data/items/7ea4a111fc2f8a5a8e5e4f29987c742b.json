  "description": "Adam and Dr. Drew open the show with Drew recounting the realization he had when he drove through Laurel Canyon recently and how it led him to realize that he's seen this kind of thing before. Adam also recalls a recent interview he did and the stark differences that he is observing in which side of the aisle is interested in protecting which rights of citizens.  They then turn to the phones and speak to a caller who is suffering from a recurrence of tinnitus and is wondering if it's Covid related. They also speak to a returning caller who works in law enforcement in San Francisco for an update on the state of affairs in his city and finally a caller with a theory on why Africa has done so well with Covid despite a low vaccination rate. \n\nPlease Support Our Sponsors:\nSimpliSafe.com/ADAM2\nCon-Cret.com/podcast\nTrueBill.com/ADS\nTalkSpace.com, promo code ADS\nLiveXLive.com/ADAMandDREW\n",
