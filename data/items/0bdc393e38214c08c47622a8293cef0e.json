  "description": "<p>Andy Baio and Andy McMillan simultaneously had the idea for an arts-and-technology conference, and the synchronistic good fortune to wind up in the same city, at the same bar, with the same friend who connected them to talk. The result was <a href=\"http://2013.xoxofest.com/\">XOXO</a>, an event that tore the top of my head right off and led directly to creating this podcast. Hundreds of attendees and tens of thousands of video watchers describe similar enlightenment about what's currently possible — without cynicism, snark, irony, or greed. Andy and Andy talk about the <a href=\"http://2012.xoxofest.com/\">first XOXO in 2012</a>, and preview the second outing, coming in September 2013.
