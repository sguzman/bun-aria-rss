  "description": "On Thursday’s Mark Levin Show, Democrats and the leftist media are so shameless attacking President Trump for responding to their fake issues. They don’t care about the people that perished in Puerto Rico last year, but they use them to paint Trump as an incompetent racist. This is their game every time there’s a natural disaster with a Republican in office. Assigning 3,000 deaths to Trump to score political points is morbid and sick. We’ve been dragged down as a society by the tyrannical “free press” – leftists dressed up as reporters and journalists distorting events. Also, Dianne Feinstein is completely eviscerating the Supreme Court confirmation process by forwarding an anonymous letter to the FBI about possible sexual misconduct by Brett Kavanaugh. This is where Democrats always go to discredit Republicans, just like with Clarence Thomas. Congress is supposed to work for us, but instead they undermine us with these games.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
