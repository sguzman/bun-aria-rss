  "description": "Every night — or really, early morning — during South By Southwest, Bob Boilen, Carrie Brownstein, Robin Hilton and Stephen Thompson will meet up on some random street corner in Austin, Texas and break down the events of the day. And every morning during the festival we'll post these lively and increasingly loopy recaps here and on the blog. In this second installment, the gang met up around 2:30 a.m. to rave about NPR Music's SXSW daytime party at The Parish, which included Brooklyn Rider, Smith Westerns, Local Natives, G-Side, Surfer Blood, and Sleigh Bells. They also talk about some of the shows they were able to catch later that night in venues all across Austin.",
