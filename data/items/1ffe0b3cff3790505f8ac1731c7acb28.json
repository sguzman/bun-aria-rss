  "description": "<p>We bring you a new interview today with the first ever Nordic Combined athlete we've had on the show, the one and only Nathaniel Mah. In this chat Nathaniel explains the unique sport of Nordic Combined to us and carries us through his history of getting into the sport. We also talk to him about what it was like competing in Canada where the sport isn't nearly as prominent as other countries in the world. Nathaniel catches us up on what he's been up to since retiring last year, and of course answers our \"My Name Is\" series of questions.</p>",
