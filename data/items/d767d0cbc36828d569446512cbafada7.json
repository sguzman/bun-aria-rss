  "description": "<p>This week, we’re tackling that most sensitive of topics - money. We didn’t have much of a plan for this episode - we just decided to start talking and see what happened. And what happened was a fascinating conversation about how we view money and why. Where are we generous? Where do we hold back? How does upbringing show up in our current relationship with money? Why will Alice happily buy a new car, but haggle for a £2 discount on a canvas? Why is Louise perfectly happy spending money on other peoples’ stuff, but sometimes struggles to charge a fair price for her own art? And how are we working to change our relationship to money? We also get into the financial side of an art career- for those who want to make a living from art, we consider the questions to ask yourself and the conscious steps you can take in the right direction.&nbsp;</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p>Parasite <a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEUXfv87Wpk\">https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SEUXfv87Wpk</a></p>\n<p>Reply All podcast <a href=\"https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all\">https://gimletmedia.com/shows/reply-all</a></p>\n<p>Book a personal session with Alice: <a href=\"https://bookme.name/alicesheridan\">https://bookme.name/alicesheridan</a></p>\n<p><br></p>\n<p>Find us and sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\">bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</a></p>\n<p>Support the podcast with a small donation at: <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\">https://ko-fi.com/artjuice</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p>Alice <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com@alicesheridanstudio/\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p>Louise <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p><strong>Credits</strong></p>\n<p><em>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</em></p>\n",
