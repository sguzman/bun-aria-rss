  "description": "Some theories violate common sense so wildly that you want to just reject them out of hand. For example, \"The United States is conscious,\" or \"The most moral act would be to replace all living beings with an orgasmic blob.\" On the other hand, many theories in physics that sounded similarly crazy turned out to be very well-supported (think of quantum theory, or relativity). So what role should \"common sense\" play in evaluating new theories? This episode features a discussion with philosopher Eric Schwitzgebel on his theory of \"Crazyism,\" that we should expect the truth to be at least a little bit crazy.",
