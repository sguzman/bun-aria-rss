  "description": "<p>Simulators driven by deep learning are gaining popularity as a tool for\nefficiently emulating accurate but expensive numerical simulators. Successful\napplications of such neural simulators can be found in the domains of physics,\nchemistry, and structural biology, amongst others. Likewise, a neural simulator\nfor cellular dynamics can augment lab experiments and traditional computational\nmethods to enhance our understanding of a cell's interaction with its physical\nenvironment. In this work, we propose an autoregressive probabilistic model\nthat can reproduce spatiotemporal dynamics of single cell migration,\ntraditionally simulated with the Cellular Potts model. We observe that standard\nsingle-step training methods do not only lead to inconsistent rollout\nstability, but also fail to accurately capture the stochastic aspects of the\ndynamics, and we propose training strategies to mitigate these issues. Our\nevaluation on two proof-of-concept experimental scenarios shows that neural\nmethods have the potential to faithfully simulate stochastic cellular dynamics\nat least an order of magnitude faster than a state-of-the-art implementation of\nthe Cellular Potts model.\n</p>",
