member of the Junior Ranks to be interviewed for the podcast as well as the first television star; as he had been featured on a season of The Amazing Race Canada.</p>\n<p>He is well known for his efforts in supporting the recovery of wounded soldiers as he had to go through that himself when a land mine blew both of his feet off in Afghanistan.  He is also the founder of <a title=\"Never Quite

amputee children, and first responders injured in the line of duty by conducting special events and product sales.</p>\n<p>It was truly a pleasure to have the opportunity to speak with him and listen to his experiences brought to life.</p>\n<p>Don&#8217;t forget that you can support this site by shopping on <a title=\"Amazon.ca\" href=\"http://www.amazon.ca?_encoding=UTF8&tag=thecanamilihi-20\"
