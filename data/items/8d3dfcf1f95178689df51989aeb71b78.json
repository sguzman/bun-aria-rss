  "description": "<div>My guest on this week's podcast is best known as a stand-up comic, and co-host of the hit second world war podcast <em>We Have Ways of Making You Talk. </em>Now Al Murray has produced a book – <em>Command: How The Allies Learned To Win the Second World War</em> – in which he looks at the progress of the war through case studies of the men who, one way and another, made a difference to it. He tells me how we turned round a war we spent three years losing so badly, and along the way provides some sharp reassessments of (among other eminences) Orde Wingate, George Patton and the two-pound gun. </div>\n",
