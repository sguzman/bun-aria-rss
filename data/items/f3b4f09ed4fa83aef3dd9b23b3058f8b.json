  "description": "<p>Andrew Santino met me for the last podcast in my quarantine to talk about the wet brown devil, whisky. Bourbon, Scotch, Rye, you know what I'm talking about. It's my favorite alcohol. For when I want to smoke cigars, for when I want to be surly, for when I want to relax, for when I'm drinking.</p> <p>Andrew is a hilarious comic and you should DEFINITELY go see him if he's in your town. But since that looks like it might never happen again, watch his show \"Dave\" on FX. It's as funny as you can get for not being standup.</p> <p>If you want to order the shroomfest shirt, you have till Thursday to get it in time for the holiday. Wear it with pride. <a href= \"https://podcastmerch.com/products/shroomfest-2020-presale-shirt?utm_source=shortlink&utm_lkey=i7h0e\"> https://podcastmerch.com/products/shroomfest-2020-presale-shirt?utm_source=shortlink&utm_lkey=i7h0e</a></p> <p><strong><em>The Music</em></strong></p> <p>Willie Nelson - Whisky River</p> <p>Chris Stapleton - Tennessee Whisky</p> <p>Flamin Groovies - Whisky Woman</p> <p>The Dubliners - Whiskey In The Jar</p> <p>Muddy Waters - Whisky You Ain't No Good</p> <p> </p>",
