And some notes on the Lazarus Group, and a quick look at information ops across the Taiwan Strait. Emily Wilson from Terbium Labs with details from their recent report, “How Fraud Stole Christmas.” Guest is Karl Sigler from Trustwave in the risks of using Windows 7.\n For links to all of today's stories check our our CyberWire daily news brief:\n  https://thecyberwire.com/issues/issues2020/January/CyberWire_2020_01_09.html\n Support our show",
