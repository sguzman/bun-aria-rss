  "description": "<p>Scott Soshnick, Michael Barr and Eben Novy-Williams discuss a host of issues related to the business of sports, including the most valuable sneaker in the world that no one seems able to locate. The Nike sneaker that unraveled while being worn by Duke standout Zion Williamson earlier this season is worth, according to one estimate, $250,000. That said, no one associated with the program, including Williamson himself, knows where the sneaker is. Duke was eliminated from the NCAA men's basketball tournament by Michigan State, ending their season and likely Williamson's college career. Also discussed is a Final Four that pits Virginia against Auburn and Michigan State against Texas Tech -- matchups less desirable to CBS executives than programs like Duke and Kentucky. Also touched on is Buffalo Wild Wings' sponsorship of the overtime period in games, and whether such targeted commercials are the future of advertising. </p><p>Hosts: Scott Soshnick, Michael Barr and Eben Novy-Williams</p><p>Producer: Madena Parwana</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
