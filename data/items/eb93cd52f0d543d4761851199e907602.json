  "description": "<p>Tom Rhodes had me over to his pad to tell me about his unique new album, Around the World. It's a standup look at over 20 cities. So we took the opportunity to get Tom to answer some of my questions about these cities. He's been everywhere. Everywhere! Come along with me and be prepared to get the travel bug. I got it bad for one city from this conversation. Tom Rhodes is gonna take us on a trip around the world!</p>",
