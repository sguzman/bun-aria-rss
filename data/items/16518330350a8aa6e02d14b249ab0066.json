After over a decade of living the dream and growing her business, she's decided to share her journey to success. More importantly, she is shining light on her village of people who have journeyed with her and got her to where she is now.<br>\n<br>\nDelina believes that every person needs their own village to achieve success. No one person can do it all by themselves. The motivation and the push to reach for your dreams and live it comes from within and from people you meet. Sometimes, even the not-so-good feedback drives you more to prove them wrong and in effect, they have also helped you reach your goals.<br>\n<br>\nIn 'It Takes A Village,' we start with Delina's aha moment from when she decides to quit her job and start living her life as a creative freelance artist. We get to meet family members, friends, mentors, and colleagues. We'll hear about relationships and stories that are as real and honest as they can get. Listen to all the episodes and we're sure you'll begin to reflect on your own dreams, passion, career, and of course, your own village.<br>\n<br>\nThis is Delina's village and you're about to be a part of it.</p>\n<p>Welcome to It Takes A Village, The True Story of A Beautypreneur.</p>\n",
