  "description": "<p>Ever felt like you've been chasing your dreams forever? Like no matter how hard you work you make hardly any progress? Or like the journey has been more non-linear than clear? In this episode, Jordan brings on Jodi Rademaker of Love and the Outcome, and the two share stories on finding balance in a busy, on-the-go-lifestyle. Additionally, they offer steps on how to be unashamed of your ambition but also faithful in the mundane, unglamorous moments of life. Tune in to learn why the long road isn't necessarily the wrong road, what \"healthy hustle\" means, and why some investments that don't appear to have a financial payoff are the ones worth making. </p>   Follow Jodi here: <a href=\"http://instagram.com/loveandtheoutcome\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener\">instagram.com/loveandtheoutcome</a>\n",
