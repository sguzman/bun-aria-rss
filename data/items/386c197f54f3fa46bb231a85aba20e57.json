  "description": "<p>r/Entitledparents In today's episode, OP pretends to be a cowboy as a hobby. No, seriously -- he dresses up like a cowboy, goes to public events like county fairs, and teaches people about weapons from the Wild West. He comes across a young man about 16 years old who is very interested in one of his antique pieces. OP says that the boy will need his parent's permission before he can hold it because, well, he's a responsible human being. The boy's father shows up SCREAMING at OP to hand over the gun, and then goes on a long rant about how he's a free American and he has a right to other people's property. Yeah, he's that kind of crazy.</p>\n",
