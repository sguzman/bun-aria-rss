With a background in cancer and genetics research, Kelly returned to study a postgraduate degree in nutrition. She places a particular focus on eating to optimise blood sugar balance, developing personalised plans for her clients that consider lifestyle sustainability and ensuring they feel their best.\nAt the end of the day, Kelly’s focus is ensuring that her clients feel in control of and empowered by their food choices. Her philosophy revolves around the “Fab 4” structure, prioritising protein, fat, fibre, and leafy greens to promote blood sugar balance.\n\nIn this episode, you’ll learn about blood glucose control and Kelly’s food choice recommendations.
