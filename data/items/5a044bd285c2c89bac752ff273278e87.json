  "description": "Contributor(s): Vishal Talreja | Education is a national endeavour, but with our growing interdependence, is it time we acknowledge it has a global purpose? Join us for the launch of Thrive: The Purpose of Schools in a Changing World.\nThe event will take the form of an open conversation about the risks and opportunities as education takes a new course. There is no denying that education is in a moment of flux. With disrupted labour markets, entrenched inequality, and stalled social mobility, long-standing international assumptions about education’s purpose are under strain. Meanwhile, the climate crisis and the reckoning with colonialism are pressing for wholescale reform of what schools and universities prioritise. What movements or institutions are fit to lead this change? And what form should change take? There is a need for a new narrative of what education is for: can it be global?\nMeet our speakers and chair\nSuchetha Bhat (@suchethab) is the CEO of Dream a Dream, a nonprofit in India working with 3 million children a year in four states across India, empowering those from vulnerable backgrounds to overcome adversity and thrive in a fast-changing world.
