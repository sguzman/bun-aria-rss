  "description": "<p>Journalist Séamus Malekafzali joins me to try to get a head start on assessing the state of Iran’s June presidential election, a task that I acknowledge is a bit of a sucker’s game since the Guardian Council hasn’t started rejecting candidates yet. At this point the only thing we know for sure is that term-limited incumbent Hassan Rouhani won’t be sticking around.</p><p>But along the way we discuss the current direction of Iranian politics, the increasing politicization of the Islamic Revolutionary Guard Corps, and check in with a couple of prominent presidential candidates from years past, including once and would-be future President Mahmoud Ahmadinejad.</p><p>Check out Séamus’s writing on Iranian politics and other stories about the Middle East at his <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://malekafzali.substack.com/\">Substack newsletter</a>, and also check out his podcast, <em>The Greatest Sin</em>, <a target=\"_blank\" href=\"https://www.greatestsinpod.com/\">here</a> or at Spotify and Apple Podcasts.</p><p>(The episode title refers to the current year on the Iranian calendar, if that wasn’t clear.)</p> <br/><br/>This is a public episode.
