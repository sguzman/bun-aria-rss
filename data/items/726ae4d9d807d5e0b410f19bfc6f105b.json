  "description": "<p>To get our needs met, we first have to be able to articulate our needs – and be brave enough to share them out loud. But it’s easier said than done! We get worried about what the other person will say, or we don’t have the words to express what we want, so we bury those longings and wait for a better time. Then before we know it, years have passed, and that better time <em>never</em> arrived. We’re sexually frustrated and resentful, because we never had the sex talk that was crucial to our happiness…until now.&nbsp;</p><br><p>On this show, we’re leaning into discomfort, so we can come out on the other side sexually satisfied. In other words: we’re learning how to have a sex talk! Even when it’s just with yourself. How do you cultivate positive self-talk, when everyone around you affirms your hotness - but your brain just doesn’t buy it? Or how about when one of you wants to have sex every day, and the other doesn’t: how do you communicate your way through mismatched desires? Finally, let’s get into improving the quality of your sex life with a partner: when the sex itself has become rote, routine, or just plain boring, how do you revive it? The first step is an open conversation, and on this episode, I’m giving you scripts and tools so you can get over those fears, and get into mutually satisfying pleasure.&nbsp;</p><br><p><strong>Show Notes:</strong></p><br><p><a href=\"https://sexwithemily.com/guides/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">The Sex with Emily<strong> </strong>Yes No Maybe List</a></p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
