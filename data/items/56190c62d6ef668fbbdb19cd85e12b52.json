  "description": "The jig is up, the news is out, they finally found Tristan and Isolde. They were renegades who had it made, but they were caught red-handed...mainly because of the blood...when Tristan and Isolde fell into the dwarf's trap and attempted a late night tryst. The executioners are already building their pyre, and they will be thrown atop it in the morning. The creature is a horse with gross little noodle legs. Oh and also he might try eat you, but really, which mythological creature won't try to eat you? -- Sponsors: Turo: Get $25 off your first trip when you sign up for Turo and use promo code LEGENDS at checkout when you go to Turo.com Bombas.
