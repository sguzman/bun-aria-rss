    "media:description": "In the second century CE, the Romans exiled the Jews of Judea and created a far flung diaspora which saw many Jews make their way to Europe, Asia and North Africa. Those who ended up in the East in countries like Iraq, Iran, and Syria and in North African countries like Egypt, Morocco and Tunisia would later become known as Mizrahi Jews. \n\nMizrahi Jews often prospered under Muslim rule in these countries, however by the twentieth century, as Nazi ideology spread to the Middle East, they found themselves facing violent attacks from their once peaceful neighbors. \n\nBy the mid-twentieth century, Mizrahi Jews were in desperate need of a safe haven. From 1948 to 1972, nearly 600,000 immigrated to Israel alongside other Jewish refugees from around the world. Though they faced a difficult transition and discrimination in their new home, Israel today is known for its richly-integrated Mizrahi culture.\n\nSubscribe and turn on your notifications so you don’t miss future uploads!\nhttps://www.youtube.com/UNPACKED?sub_confirmation=1 \n\nRecommended video—The Truth About Ashkenazi Jews\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cw0G9COpeMY&list=PL-DNOnmKkUaZrTGuvoIJFOgn4nr375SR_&index=51\n\nWe have merch! – http://shop.jewishunpacked.com/?utm_medium=youtube&utm_source=video-description&utm_campaign=merch\n\nLet’s connect:\nWebsite — https://www.jewishunpacked.com\nInstagram — https://www.instagram.com/jewishunpacked\nTwitter — https://twitter.com/jewishunpacked\nTikTok — https://www.tiktok.com/@jewishunpacked\nFacebook — https://www.facebook.com/jewishunpacked\n\n-----------\nExecutive Producers:\n- Melinda Goldrich\n- Shmuel Katz\n\nGold Level:\n- Goldrich Family Foundation\n-----------\nImage and footage credits:\nIsrael GPO-Teddy Brauner\nBoris Carmi / Meitar Collection / National Library of Israel / The Pritzker Family National Photography Collection\nIsrael GPO-Fritz Cohen\nIsrael GPO-David Eldan\nIsrael GPO-Amos ben Gershom\nIsrael GPO-Seymour Katcoff\nIsrael GPO-Zoltan Kluger\nIsrael GPO-Moshe Milner\nIsrael GPO-Mark Neyman\nIsrael GPO-Avi Ohayon\nIsrael GPO-Hans Pinn\nIsrael GPO-Yaakov Saar\nMaurice Mamane\nNadav Mann, BITMUNA.
