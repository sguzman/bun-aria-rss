  "description": "<p>There’s something big happening that few people are really talking about in a meaningful and constructive way. A sense of loss, on so many levels, even if there’s also hope and excitement. We hate talking about this stuff, but it’s so important.</p><p>Whenever I’m grappling with any kind of loss or grief, whether around a person or even just a broader sense of freedom, connection, humanity, or possibility, my go-to person is my dear friend, Megan Devine, who also happens to be today’s guest. Megan is a psychotherapist and grief advocate. She's the author of the best-selling book, <em>It's OK that You're Not OK</em>, and the new guided journal for grief, <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3zDRig8\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><em>How to Carry What Can't Be Fixed</em></a>.</p><p>Megan was on the show back in 2016, but I asked her to come back after a conversation we had about how so many of us are carrying an unacknowledged sense of loss and grief right now. I wanted to explore what that does to us, what it means for us, and how to work with it in a way that owns the reality, and also allows us to be changed, and move forward from a place of greater understanding, and maybe even lightness and grace.
