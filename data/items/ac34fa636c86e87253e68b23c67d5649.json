  "description": "Sermon on The Mount: Chapter 17 - “Pearls, Pigs & Pushing Good Things on Others.” Matthew 7:6. “Do not give dogs what is sacred…” Again(!), another section of the sermon that has been taught a lot, but is often missing the point or full context Jesus was bringing. The word of the day (week, year, lifetime) is discernment. So much of what is said here is dismantling the place of condemnation the Church has taken. What is Jesus saying when using the terms ‘dogs’ and ‘pigs?’ Is it derogatory? What is sacred? What are the pearls? How are we to interact with those that need intervention? How does this section fit into and correlate with the previous parts of the Sermon? \n\nThis thread is long, but Jesus is dissecting and confronting so much of how we interact and love as humans. How are we supposed to live life together both in community and in the world? We have much to learn from this section. Jesus understands the complexities of the issue, as well as the depth and uniqueness of each person listening.\n \nWe at VOX are committed to not only confronting all of this, first in ourselves, but also to wrestle with what Jesus would have for us in this time. We are committed to repentance and a pursuit of discernment.\n\nThis is the second section of the Sermon on the Mount. We’re excited to walk this road with you all.\n\nAs always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
