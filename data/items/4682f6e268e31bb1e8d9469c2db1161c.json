  "description": "To the degree that Canadians remember the treatment passengers on the Komagata Maru received when they were barred entry to the port of Vancouver in 1914, it is typically remembered in contrast to the supposed multiculturalism and openness of the country today. Contributors to this volume challenge this framing from top to bottom; not only do they trace out the legacies of the Komagata Maru as ongoing history, but they simultaneously challenge recovery narratives that obscure the colonial and imperial dynamics that are ultimately so fundamental to this story.\nPhil Henderson is a SSHRC Postdoctoral Research Fellow at Carleton University’s Institute of Political Economy where his research interests focus on the interrelations between Indigenous land/water defenders and organized labour in what’s presently known as Canada.
