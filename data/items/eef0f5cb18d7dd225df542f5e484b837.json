  "description": "<p>Meet&nbsp;François D’Haene.</p><br><p>One of the greatest (some say&nbsp;<em>the</em>&nbsp;greatest) ultra-distance trail runners in the world, French superstar François is a former physiotherapist turned winemaker who has collected 36 victories and 51 podiums across some of the most prestigious and challenging races in the world. His palmarès include taking victory at UTMB an astonishing four times, a record&nbsp;only recently matched by Kílian Jornet&nbsp;this year. In 2017, François clocked the fastest-ever traverse of the 210-mile John Muir Trail. And in 2021, he won the Hardrock 100, one of the most difficult trail ultras, breaking the overall record previously held by Jornet.</p><br><p>Beyond the glow of ultra superstardom, François keeps things simple—a lifestyle that prioritizes his family as a dad to three. And an approach to sustained excellence that values community, connection, and nature over race results and rewards.</p><br><p>It’s this disposition—a rare balance many athletes of his caliber struggle to master—that I find most compelling. And it’s the focus of today’s fascinating exploration.</p><br><p>Today we explore the elements of François’ mastery.</p><br><p>We parse his humble and grounded approach to craft—and how this mindset has contributed to sustained success and career longevity at the highest level of sport.</p><br><p>In addition, we discuss the principles that drive him, the details of his training regimen, the allure of nature, advice for tackling your first ultra, and many other topics.</p><br><p>But more than anything, this is a conversation about the tension between the rigors of pursuing mastery and the value of important life experiences beyond the parameters of sport.</p><br><p>Read: <a href=\"https://bit.ly/richroll708\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Show notes</a>.</p><br><p>I should say up front that François’ French accent can be a bit thick at times, but if you listen closely and aren’t tempted to increase the playback speed, you should be able to follow him just fine.
