    "media:description": "A deep zoom all the way to a magnification of 4e2656  (that is 4 with 2656 zeros after it).  Imagine if your camera could do that!  A clasic colouring and some trap sounds from \"Damma Beatz\" for this zoom.  It's a long one so if you don't enjoy my music selection, play something of your own.\n\nAs usual, I have disabled mid-roll ads, so you can enjoy this 3 hour zoom uninterupted.\n\nAll these infinite shapes and patterns are created simply by calculating the equation \"z=z²+c\" over and over again.  How such a simple equation creates such intricate shapes is one of the many wonders of the mathematical world.\n\nThank-you to my supporters on Patreon.\n\nThis video will be available for Patreons to download in the coming days, which will have a higher bitrate.  You can also use these visuals on your own channel if you are a member of my Patreon page. https://www.patreon.com/mathstown\n\n/********************************************************************************\nPatreon: https://www.patreon.com/mathstown (Support, Downloads & Usage Rights)\nTwitter: https://twitter.com/MathsTown\nDiscord: https://discord.gg/YphYVt787v (Drop by and say hello)\nGrab a T-Shirt: https://amzn.to/3eIfqmX\nWebsite: https://www.maths.town/videos/deepish-video/\nOpenSea: https://opensea.io/collection/maths-town\n********************************************************************************/\n\nMusic from Epidemic Sound: https://www.epidemicsound.com/referral/ekoiev/\nAll tracks by \"Damma Beatz\", be sure to check them out on Spotify.\n\n#Mandelbrot #fractal #mathstown #fractals\nZoom: 4.7e2565\nIterations: 591202796\n\nThe location info is too big for the description, you can find it here: https://www.maths.town/videos/deepish-video/",
