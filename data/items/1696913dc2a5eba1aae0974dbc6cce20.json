  "description": "<p>I am returning from the beach after a long needed break. Tonight will be a replay. I really needed to recharge the batteries. I will return next week. Bo writes “If you got time maybe give me a call sometime. I want to tell you my encounter. To sum it up, I hit one with my car when I was 19 yrs old.” Spoke to the witness and he has agreed to come on the show. The encounter took place almost 20 years ago. He describes leaving an area late one night when this creature jumped in front of his car. He said he had his high beams on and saw this creature right before he hit it. He said it was a small creature and it reminded him of a baby gorilla or monkey. At the last moment he hit it and the impact caused a lot of damage. As he slowed down he heard a scream/roar from the tree line. The witness said he was terrified about what he just hit and now something else let out this scream/roar that seemed to shake his insides. The witness hit the gas and as he came around the bend he is pretty sure what ever roared at him was chasing him because he heard it again right next to the road. There is a lot of details we will discuss in this encounter. I will also be speaking to Tom who was on SC EP:319, he is returning to the show to talk about a recent encounter on his property.</p>",
