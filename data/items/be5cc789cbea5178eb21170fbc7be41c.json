  "description": "<p>Jon is joined by Geoffrey Berman, a former US attorney from the Southern District of New York—and author of the new book Holding the Line: Inside the Nation’s Preeminent US Attorney’s Office and Its Battle with the Trump Justice Department. They dig into how Bill Barr tried to have Berman fired, why nailing down powerful guys like Trump is so hard, and whether better guardrails could protect our democracy. Berman also happened to be Jon’s neighbor growing up in New Jersey, so they reminisce about old neighborhood gossip. Plus, writers Jay Jurden and Tocarra Mallard trash-talk Ron DeSantis and Brett Favre, who fully deserve it.</p><p>CREDITS</p><p>Hosted by: Jon Stewart</p><p><br></p><p>Featuring, in order of appearance:</p><p><br></p><p>Tocarra Mallard, Jay Jurden, Geoffrey Berman</p><p><br></p><p>Executive Produced by Jon Stewart, Brinda Adhikari, James Dixon, Chris McShane, and Richard Plepler.</p><p>Lead Producer: Sophie Erickson</p><p>Producers: Zach Goldbaum, Caity Gray, and Robby Slowik</p><p><br></p><p>Assoc.
