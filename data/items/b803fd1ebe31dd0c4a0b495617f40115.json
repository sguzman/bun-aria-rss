  "description": "<p data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">This is a total breakdown of how I plan food.</p> <p>Unless you live under a rock you know all about making a Doable Food Plan.</p> <p>I firmly believe that writing down what you WILL eat for the day ahead of time works.</p> <p>First, the version of you planning the food is looking at what you are facing that day and balancing it against what you want for yourself in a week, a month, and a year.</p> <p>Second, if you're like me the reason you need to lose weight is that when you're left to \"figure out what to eat\" or \"decide what you want in the moment\" your EMOTIONS are doing the talking. And often the emotions of the moment are stress, anxiety, or busted ass tired. None of those guys ever make \"healthy\" choices.</p> <p>Third, you need to quit thinking about food so fucking much! Write it down and the rest of the day think about your LIFE. Not what you are eating the next meal so you have something to look forward to. (Hint: that's a huge problem if the only joy you get is looking forward to what you'll eat.)</p> <p>On today's podcast, Kathy and I break down how we plan our food. We teach you...</p> <p>The difference between a daily plan and a weekly food plan. Yes, there's more than one way to do this and you'll learn all about picking one that works best for you.</p> <p>Why planning is key to your weightloss success (and how it helps you start believing in your ability to lose weight).</p> <p>How we do our planning. We walk you through our process, what we ask ourselves, how we include date nights, workouts, and more.</p> <p> </p> <p>Get the Free Course here:<br /> <u><a class=\"ProsemirrorEditor-link\" href= \"http://NoBSFreeCourse.com\">http://NoBSFreeCourse.com</a></u></p>",
