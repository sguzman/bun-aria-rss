  "description": "<p>Alan Macey thinks about cars differently than we do. After graduating from Art Center of Pasadena (arguably the best school for automotive design in the world), he interned at VW, and then worked as a designer at Jeep. He sees cars differently than us. We see a panel gap, and he knows why it's that size. He understands the constraints designers have when they design a new car. He also created the Manual Gearbox Preservation Society ( links below).   We talk about design, Bugatti, VW, challenges of selling a new car, and then we get into a DEEP conversation about AI, the future of car ownership, and argue about how soon it will all arrive.   It's a good listen. </p><p>New Shirts: <a href=\"https://www\">https://www</a>.blipshift/com/tst</p><p>Follow us!</p><p>T: @thesmokingtire @zackklapman @amacey3000</p><p>IG: @thesmokingtire @fakezackklapman </p><p>https://www.facebook.com/TheManualGearboxPreservationSociey/<br />https://thecurbshop.com/collections/all-products</p><p> </p><p>WATCH this show: https://youtu.be/S9ocH3gZ3Yw</p>\n",
