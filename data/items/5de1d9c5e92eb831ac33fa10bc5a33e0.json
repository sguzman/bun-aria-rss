  "description": "On Mondays Mark Levin Show, President Trump announces an end to all violence and a deployment of the military in Washington, DC, and will deploy them in other states if their governors don't. America is a nation of 330 million citizens of different races and religions and, for the most part, they are law-abiding people that love their country. Of course, there are imperfect organizations and people but by and large no one signs up to risk their lives to fight wars for a systemically racist country. America is not systemically racist. Then, the time has come to put down the insurrection. The intentional silence of Joe Biden and Nancy Pelosi to condemn the violence is outrageous. The media relentlessly calls for President Trump to speak in a conciliatory tone that is inappropriate. Trump responded faster than any previous president facing similar circumstances directing the Department of Justice to get involved immediately. The media will never be satisfied until Trump sounds like Obama or Clinton and they are blind to the facts. Later, ANTIFA is highly well-funded and organized and is focused on the police and anti-Americanism. White college-aged kids seem to be more and more involved in the violence in cities suffering from riots. The Department of Justice is likely surveilling and building a criminal case for those instigating violence turning otherwise peaceful protests into riots. Afterward, Rabbi Steven Burg joins the program to discuss vandalism on synagogues and the brutalization of the Jewish community in Brooklyn, NY.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
