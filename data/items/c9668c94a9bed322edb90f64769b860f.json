  "description": "Today’s show is the definition of a Feel Good Friday as Pat sits down with a couple of great guests. First, ESPN MLB Insider, Jeff Passan joins the program. Pat and Jeff chat about the MLB’s plans to start the season and what they look like, Jeff reacts to Rays pitcher Blake Snell saying that he won’t play for a reduced salary, what opening Arizona and Florida for professional teams could mean for teams like the Yankees and Dodgers, and if the coronavirus is going to end up being the thing that sweeps the Houston Astros’ transgressions under the rug (00:00:40-20:25). Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk where Pat and AJ dive into the things happening in the MLB and try to decide whether or not Blake Snell is making any good points, they discuss Pat as a potential major league ballplayer, the NFL deciding to pipe in crowd noise to the games and whether that would benefit the product on the field, and everything else going on in the sports world (22:36-1:59:57). Next, 2x Pro Bowler, All-Pro, member of the Philadelphia Eagles Hall of Fame, Brian Westbrook joins the show. Pat and Brian chat about his thoughts regarding people saying that Clyde Edwards-Helaire was a better version of him, and having to clear that up with Andy Reid, how he’s been handling quarantine on his horse farm, what he thought of the Eagles drafting Jalen Hurts, and Pat and Brian create potentially the most electric punt return game of all-time (2:00:00-2:17:45). Lastly, 13 year NFL veteran and newest member of the Chicago Bears, Ted Ginn Jr. joins the show. Pat and Ted chat about how he eventually landed on the Bears, why he believes in Coach Nagy, if he’s ever played with someone that is faster than him, and why track speed doesn’t necessarily translate to football speed (2:17:47-2:28:12). Don’t forget to send in a picture of where you’re watching the show with the hashtag #ThisIsWhereImAtPat. Come and laugh with us, and enjoy your weekend.\n",
