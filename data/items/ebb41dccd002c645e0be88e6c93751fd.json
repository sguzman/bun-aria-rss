  "description": "Every child’s brain works differently. A scratchy t-shirt tag or excited squeals at a birthday party might be no big deal for one kid… and cue a *total* meltdown for another. What’s going on for kids who feel extra sensitive to sights, sounds, smells, tastes, or textures? And what can parents do? This week, Dr. Becky talks to Laura Petix—the pediatric occupational therapist behind @TheOTButterfly and mom to a sensory sensitive four-year-old herself—to answer these questions and more. They talk all about parenting neurodivergent kids, whose brains process the world in unique ways, and offer practical strategies to support their needs. Whether you’re familiar with terms like “occupational therapy,” “neurodivergence,” and “sensory processing” or hearing them for the first time, you’ll leave this podcast with a deeper understanding of how sensory systems shape behavior and why it’s so important to believe what our kids perceive.<p/>\n<p/>\nIf you’re thinking, “This sounds like my kid,” follow Laura on Instagram at @TheOTButterfly and visit [www.theotbutterfly.com/drbecky](http://www.theotbutterfly.com/drbecky) to learn more. <p/>\n<p/>\n<p/>\nJoin Good Inside Membership: https://bit.ly/3cqgG2A  <p/>\nFollow Dr. Becky on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/drbeckyatgoodinside <p/>\nSign up for our weekly email, Good Insider: https://www.goodinside.com/newsletter <p/>\nPre-order Dr. Becky's upcoming book, Good Inside: A Guide to Becoming the Parent You Want to Be: www.goodinside.com/book or wherever you order your books.<p/>\n<p/>\n",
