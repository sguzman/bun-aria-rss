  "description": "In the third week of our new series, The Paradox of Purpose we learned that we often blame the devil for things that we should take ownership of. Pastor Charles taught us about deferred responsibility which is the act of placing ownership of one's attitude, circumstance or life on another person. It’s not always the devil, sometimes we are distracted, emotional, vulnerable, irresponsible or lazy. Make sure and check out this message and share it with someone who needs to hear it!<br /><br />Join us for service online every Sunday at 11am (CST) and on Monday’s for Monday Night Prayer at 6pm (CST). <br /><br />If you received Christ through this message, text SAVED to 828282.<br /><br />We would love to hear how God is touching your life through this ministry!
