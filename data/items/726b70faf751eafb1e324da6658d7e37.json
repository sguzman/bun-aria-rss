  "description": "Murder Of Robert Wone. August 2nd, 2006. A Washington D.C. attorney is invited to stay at his friends' house. He had started a new job and would be working late so he didn't feel like traveling back home. He arrives about 10:30pm and isn't there even an hour before he is discovered on a pullout bed with several knife wounds to his chest and abdomen. Those that were in the house with him, Joseph Price, Victor Zaborsky, & Dylan Ward, claim an intruder must have entered the home and killed him. The case appears to get even more bizarre once details of the evening and of the crime scene become known.
