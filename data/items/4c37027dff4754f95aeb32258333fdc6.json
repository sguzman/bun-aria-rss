  "description": "<p>Major advancements have been made in the field of object detection and\nsegmentation recently. However, when it comes to rare categories, the\nstate-of-the-art methods fail to detect them, resulting in a significant\nperformance gap between rare and frequent categories. In this paper, we\nidentify that Sigmoid or Softmax functions used in deep detectors are a major\nreason for low performance and are sub-optimal for long-tailed detection and\nsegmentation. To address this, we develop a Gumbel Optimized Loss (GOL), for\nlong-tailed detection and segmentation. It aligns with the Gumbel distribution\nof rare classes in imbalanced datasets, considering the fact that most classes\nin long-tailed detection have low expected probability. The proposed GOL\nsignificantly outperforms the best state-of-the-art method by 1.1% on AP , and\nboosts the overall segmentation by 9.0% and detection by 8.0%, particularly\nimproving detection of rare classes by 20.3%, compared to Mask-RCNN, on LVIS\ndataset.
