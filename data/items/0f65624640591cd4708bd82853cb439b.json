  "description": "<p><p>Today's episode kicks off with up-to-the-minute analysis of the fantastic Game 1 of the Stanley Cup Final from RA, Whits, and Biz. The boys get into how and why Vegas grabbed the essential 1-0 SCF lead, how come this game was the perfect showcase for the NHL, the huge contributions from Vegas's fourth line, and a whole lot more. Next, the guys welcome former Oiler and Devil Luke Gazdic to the show to fill us in on his recent backpacking trip to Southeast Asia. He talks about the wild stuff he witnessed in Bangkok, the liberation of being cell phone-free on vacation, the freedom of the solo traveler, what it was he was seeking on his journey, and, oh, some hockey. This was a cool look at some of the non-hockey interests that hockey players have. Give it a whirl.</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
