  "description": "Si and JD reveal their winning lines guaranteed to get a girl to go out with you, and the world may never be the same. But first, Godwin and Si can't get enough of the sourdough loaf JD's wife, Alyson, baked for them. A fan sends in Si's yearbook pics. Godwin is all about a 16-ounce bacon steak and the Martin-inspired sandwich he calls \"Godwin's Goodies.\" Si tries to keep JD from going negative on his wife's cooking. The boys are seriously disturbed by almond milk and intrigued by deer milk. Si talks about his family's smokehouse and how he and his dad robbed a beehive. And the boys tackle roadkill and offer relationship advice to an engaged couple and a pair of retirees.\n-\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
