  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, Rachel Mitchell, the Arizona prosecutor who was hired by Republicans to interview Christine Ford and Brett Kavanaugh, has released a memo highlighting the incredulity of her accusation. It’s clear that Ford's testimony lacked credibility and didn’t rise to the standard of prosecution. No jury would convict on a case like this because a case this weak would never make it into a court room. We have a justice system where the accused can question the accuser, where accusers can sue for civil liability, yet not a single criminal complaint was filed with the local police by any accuser. Now, the focus is on trying to paint Kavanaugh as a liar alleging that he perjured himself when testifying about his drinking in high school or college. Ford's testimony goes beyond memory issues, especially when she couldn't remember things that happened a month and a half earlier. Afterwards, the media gets their ideas from Karl Marx and their tactics from Saul Alinsky. But their attacks are really on the American electorate, on the candidates we elected in 2016, the ideas we espouse, and the liberties we love. Later, retiring Arizona Senator Jeff Flake master-minded the delay in the Kavanaugh Hearing with Chris Coons. Working with other dissenters like Senator Susan Collins decided to blind-side the rest of the committee with this delay after a meeting the evening of the hearings.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
