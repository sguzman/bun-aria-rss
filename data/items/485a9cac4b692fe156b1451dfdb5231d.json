  "title": "Ep 79 | We're All Racist, Sexist Bigots & 2+2=5 | James Lindsay | The Glenn Beck Podcast",
  "description": "Glenn interviews James Lindsay, the \"world's best Woke interpreter\" and author of the new book, \"Cynical Theories: How Activist Scholarship Made Everything about Race, Gender, and Identity―and Why This Harms Everybody.\" Despite his Ph.D. in math, Lindsay would fail a simple equation because he says our \"Woke Betters\" decide what is true and false and it doesn't matter what 2+2 equals. He argues Critical Theory has become an intolerant, parasitic ideology with its own language system and reveals the moment that became his \"woke breaking point.\" Lindsay breaks out his social justice dictionary to teach Glenn what fake words like \"responsibilize\" and \"medicalizing\" mean and that \"fascism\" doesn't mean what you think it means. An exasperated Glenn says Orwell's \"1984\" novel now reads like today's newspaper. \n\nThis Week’s Sponsor:\n\nTommy John's: Want to know the secret to staying sweat-free this summer? Glenn recommends Tommy John’s ultra-breathable underwear! They have a range of summer-ready, breathable options, but their Cool Cotton underwear for men and women is like having your own on-body AC. For a limited time, go to https://TommyJohn.com/BECK to get 20% off your first order. \nLearn more about your ad choices.
