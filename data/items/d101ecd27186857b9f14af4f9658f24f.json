  "description": "<p data-pm-slice=\"1 1 []\">I know. Me crying isn't exactly breaking news. But 46 was a special year.</p> <p>In today's podcast, Kathy does our annual interview of me. What did I learn and what do I want you to know about my life.</p> <p>As always, I was vulnerable and honest. 46 was a year that I grew emotionally and took time to love parts of me I've never explored.</p> <p>I share some powerful questions I challenged myself with.</p> <p>My favorite was, \"How much louder would I live my life if I loved myself at every turn?\"</p> <p>I talk about how I let go of...</p> <p>Needing to be busy (so I can feel important and needed).</p> <p>Thinking I'm lazy when I took time off (because I always thought if I was up I should be working or productive).</p> <p>Waiting on a perfect body to love my body. I spent the year putting my real body out into the world so I could hear my real thoughts (and change them for my own sake).</p> <p>You'll get a lot out of this episode if you keep thinking there's a body or some achievement in life that will finally feel like enough. I've spent a lifetime seeking my own approval. This year I realized how to just give it without conditions.</p> <p><span data-asana-object=\"1\" data-object-id=\"1200486409000460\" data-preferred-path=\"/0/1131362314360516/1200486409000460/f\" data-title=\"Click here\"><a href= \"https://app.asana.com/0/1131362314360516/1200486409000460/f\">Click here</a></span> to listen to Episode 228: Turning 47 (Annual Birthday Reflection).<br /> <br /></p> <p>Get the Free Course here:</p> <p><u><a class=\"ProsemirrorEditor-link\" href= \"http://NoBSFreeCourse.com\">http://NoBSFreeCourse.com</a></u></p>",
