  "description": "My special guest is Raymond Szymanski to discuss his knowledge of alien visitation to military installations including the Wright-Patterson where he worked for many years. Get his book 50 Shades of Greys on Amazon.\n\n-- Wright-Patterson Air Force Base Insider Investigation Reveals Exciting New Evidence and Theories -- Nick Pope, UK Ministry of Defense UFO Project, 1991 – 1994, Author of Encounter in Rendlesham Forest, excitedly states: “Fifty Shades of Greys is a fun and informative book that is part UFO exposé and part travel guide. Written in a gonzo style, Raymond Szymanski tours the world, researching iconic UFO sightings and meeting a colorful cast of witnesses, experts and enthusiasts along the way. The author's four-decade career as an Engineer at Wright-Patterson Air Force Base (where many believe crashed alien spaceships are stored), and his exciting new evidence will doubtless start a few conspiracy theories.” For the very first time, an executive-level Wright-Patterson Air Force Base scientist takes you on a dangerous personal search for evidence of alien visitation inside the legendary, super-secret Department of Defense installation and beyond. Unconvinced by third-person stories rewarmed in “shadow-government-conspiracy UFO books”, Raymond Szymanski presents compelling, first-person UFO research adventures and discoveries - balanced between the very serious and sometimes not-so-serious misadventures. Raymond researched many Department of Defense scientific mysteries in his distinguished career. Now armed with insider information, he’s researching the most polarizing scientific mystery-of-the-century: “Do we have Aliens?” During this life-changing journey he discovers and examines evidence of alien visitation and strong hints that, contrary to widely published reports, Air Force senior scientists may not be unanimously laughing off UFOs after all. Join Raymond’s exciting, thought provoking adventures: - In the United Kingdom’s UFO-infested Rendlesham Forest; - With Travis Walton at the secretive Walton abduction site in the Apache-Sitgreaves National Forest; - And inside the Holy Grail itself, Wright-Patterson Air Force Base. An alien visitation investigation, cloaked in mystery, wrapped in an adventure story, illustrated by more than one hundred never-before-published photographs, will be enjoyed by adventurists, enthusiasts, researchers, and conspiracy theorists alike.\n\nWanna get creeped out?
