  "description": "In Between Subjects: A Critical Genealogy of Queer Performance (Routledge, 2021) is a study of the connected ideas of \"queer\" and \"gender performance\" or \"performativity\" over the past several decades, providing an ambitious history and crucial examination of these concepts while questioning their very bases. The book traces how and why \"queer\" and \"performativity\" seem to belong together in so many discussions around identity, popular modes of gender display, and performance art. Drawing on art history and performance studies but also on feminist, queer, and sexuality studies, and postcolonial, indigenous, and critical race theoretical frameworks, it seeks to denaturalize these assumptions by questioning the US-centrism and white-dominance of discourses around queer performance or performativity.\nDr. Amelia Jones is Robert A. Day Professor and Vice Dean of Academics and Research at the Roski School of Art & Design at the University of Southern California. Her recent publications include Seeing Differently: A History and Theory of Identification and Visual Arts and Otherwise: Imagining Queer Feminist Art Histories, co-edited with Erin Silver. The catalogue Queer Communion: Ron Athey, which she co-edited with Andy Campbell, and which accompanies a retrospective of Athey’s work at Participant Inc. (New York) and ICA (Los Angeles), was listed among “Best Art Books 2020” in the New York Times.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
