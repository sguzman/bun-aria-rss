  "description": "On Thursday’s Mark Levin show, The Democrats in the Senate only used law enforcement as a crutch in their attempt to sabotage the confirmation of Brett Kavanaugh to the Supreme Court. It’s clear that there was nothing Democrats could use against Kavanaugh in the new FBI report, or they would have leaked it. The Democrat party now represents tyranny. Also, what exactly did Brett Kavanaugh do? Drink? No, that wasn’t the problem. The problem was that he embraced the Constitution, which the progressive statists cannot and will not do. This is their mentality, they are the progeny of the hard Left. They are the progeny of Hegel, Marx and Engels. Don’t be fooled. Then, Senator Patrick Leahy of Vermont has been a political hitman for the left for decades. The Washington Post referenced a statement made by Mark in 2010 in their criticism of President Trump's comment on Senator Leahy sounding like he was drunk. Later, David Limbaugh calls in to discuss his new book, “Jesus Is Risen: Paul and the Early Church”. Finally, there is a book coming out that is very kind and supportive of our nations police officers. \"Our Police\" was written for kids ages 4-9 and it was written by Jack Levin, father of Mark Levin. Mark encourages his audience to pre-order their copy.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
