  "description": "<p>Hear collaborative works of all kinds for this New Sounds, from string quartet to chamber ensemble; from piano duet to guitar music with electronics. </p>\n<p>Listen to a work, \"Trying to Speak,\" by New York guitarist and composer Kaki King, in collaboration with the string quartet ETHEL, from King's multimedia masterpiece “The Neck is a Bridge to the Body.” When she performs the work live, images are projected onto the body of her custom guitar, while she works her finger-style virtuosic magic.  </p>\n<p>Then, hear shimmering music from New York composer Chris Cerrone, in collaboration with the Chicago-based ensemble, Eighth Blackbird. From their recent record, \"Hand Eye,\" Cerrone's work, \"South Catalina\" piano, clarinet, and percussion provide stately chords augmented by a flurry of violin, cello, &amp; flute. Also, listen to a 20-fingered collaboration, ZOFO, performing music by Terry Riley.</p>\n<p>There's also collaborative music featuring the Berlin Guitar Ensemble and the Argentine-born, now Berlin-based audio artist and producer, Andrés Jankowski. A.K.A. 1605munro, and more. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>PROGRAM #3858, Collaborative Works (First Aired 5-9-2016)         </p>\n<p>ARTIST: Eighth Blackbird<br>WORK: Chris Cerrone: South Catalina, excerpt [1:50]<br>RECORDING: Hand Eye<br>SOURCE: Cedille Records 90000 162<br>INFO: <a href=\"http://www.cedillerecords.org/\">cedillerecords.org</a></p>\n<p>ARTIST: Kaki King &amp; ETHEL<br>WORK: Trying to Speak I [3:49]<br>RECORDING: The Neck is a Bridge to the Body<br>SOURCE/INFO: <a href=\"https://kakiking.bandcamp.com/album/the-neck-is-the-bridge-to-the-body\" target=\"_blank\">kakiking.bandcamp.com</a></p>\n<p>ARTIST: Kaki King &amp; ETHEL<br>WORK: Trying to Speak II [4:14]<br>RECORDING: The Neck is a Bridge to the Body<br>SOURCE/INFO: <a href=\"https://kakiking.bandcamp.com/album/the-neck-is-the-bridge-to-the-body\" target=\"_blank\">kakiking.bandcamp.com</a></p>\n<p>ARTIST: Eighth Blackbird<br>WORK: Chris Cerrone: South Catalina [10:54]<br>RECORDING: Hand Eye<br>SOURCE: Cedille Records 90000 162<br>INFO: <a href=\"http://www.cedillerecords.org/\">cedillerecords.org</a></p>\n<p>ARTIST: ZOFO<br>WORK: Terry Riley: G song [9:30]<br>RECORDING: ZOFO plays Terry Riley<br>SOURCE: Sono Luminus DSL-92189<br>INFO: <a href=\"http://www.sonoluminus.com/p-393-zofo-plays-terry-riley-blu-ray-cd.aspx\" target=\"_blank\">sonoluminus.com</a></p>\n<p>ARTIST: Berlin Guitar Ensemble vs. 1605munro<br>WORK:  Andres G.
