  "description": "Beau Beckman, Barrel Select Manager at Buffalo Trace, is now a 2nd time guest! We talk about how the program has matured, why you only get to taste 4 barrels rather than more, how the barrels are chosen for the program versus the regular blend, and how you can get your own.\nShow Notes:\n\nSo what’s been happening since the last time we chatted back on episode  009?\n\nYou’ve managed to stay off the news radar it seems like except there was a good article  Forbes put out recently and our good friend  Bourbon Truth was talking about good private barrels and said you basically had to lick someone’s balls (especially Beau beckman) to get anywhere\n\nSo we just did a pick and you said you can have the barrel or we can send it off to Mexico\n\nFor anyone that doesn’t know and didn’t catch them up to speed on your family heritage that you bashfully don’t like to talk about\n\nI was actually out here today doing a barrel selection of Buffalo Trace, talk me through the process of what I experienced today\n\nThe numbers have been dwindling at every place for barrel selections. Where it was once fruitful to try 12 or more barrels, sometimes it’s down to three. Is this just lack of mature whiskey?\n\nOr is it lets dwindle down these remaining barrels for single selections and then we will pull out new ones\n\nHow often does it happen someone will pass on a barrel and then the next group or the group after says something ridiculous like “oh man, that’s the honey barrel!”\n\nspeaking of honey barrels, do you really believe there are such a thing and how often do those go to single select?\n\nhow are the barrels chosen for single select, randomly? by a group of tasters?\n\nI've had some very off profile barrels too\n\nComing and doing a barrel pick for new whiskey geeks is like the ultimate experience. What do you attribute to the success of a single barrel program?\n\nAny advice for those stores who are itching to get on the program or know of a shortcut?",
