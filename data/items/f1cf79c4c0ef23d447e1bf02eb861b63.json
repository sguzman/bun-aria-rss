We discuss the significance and power of primary relationships. Whether with a partner, a friend, or a sibling, a “primary” is the one you most turn toward to celebrate your special moments or to seek support during hard times. It is within these relationships that we build a 2-person security system that helps us tackle the world in a more secure and robust way.\nHow To Prioritize The Relationship\nDr. Stan Tatkin shares his vast knowledge of neurobiology and attachment to help us understand how to find, build and maintain safety and security in these relationships. Our discussion reaches far and wide, including how to vet a potential partner, ways to relate in a “fair and just” manner, and the importance of understanding and communicating your own value system with others. From monogamy to polyamory relationships, it is important to understand yourself more deeply and those that you bring into your life.\n\nJoin our email list at www.therapistuncensored.com to access our private online community supporting the dissemination of the relational sciences to support healthy connections and relationships around the world!  \n\n \nRESOURCES:\nAdditional resources for this episode:\n\n \tStan Tatkin-Wired for Dating, How Understanding Neurobiology and Attachment Style Can Help You Find Your Ideal Mate\n \tStan Tatkin:Your Brain on Love, the Neurobiology of Healthy Relationships\n \tPACT – www.thepactinstitute.com\n \tStan Tatkin – Wired for Love\n \tThese and other resources have been collected for you on our Resources page!",
