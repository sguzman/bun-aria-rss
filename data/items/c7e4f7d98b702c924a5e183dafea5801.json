  "title": "Nasty or Nice? How our Attitudes Shape our Reality [110]",
  "description": "<p>This week's main topic was inspired by some recent events within online art communities. These included an anonymous letter intended to hurt and intimidate one artist, an ill-informed discussion of Cy Twombley's work, and an angry email that turned out to be the result of a mistake. We discuss how our attitudes shape our experience of the world. It is true that our assumptions often determine not only the outcome of any situation, but how we feel on a day-to-day basis. Neither of us is perfect (no really!!) but we share how we look at challenging situations and some of the ways we turn things around in our minds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>We also answer a listener question about the amount of work we produce - do we just have lots of ideas or is it something about our process that allows us to produce so many paintings in a year? This leads to a discussion about the value of working in series, and the extent to which one idea can feed many paintings.</p>\n<p><strong>Mentioned</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/elainetobinart/\">Elaine Tobin on Instagram</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.jonclayton-artist.com/\">Jon Clayton's website (look under books)</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"//\">Joan Mitchell book</a></p>\n<p><strong><br>\nFind our websites and sign up for our newsletters at:&nbsp;</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/\"><u>www.alicesheridan.com</u></a><u><strong>&nbsp;</strong></u></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p><strong>Follow us on Instagram:</strong></p>\n<p>@alicesheridanstudio&nbsp;</p>\n<p>@louisefletcher_art</p>\n<p><em>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</em></p>\n",
