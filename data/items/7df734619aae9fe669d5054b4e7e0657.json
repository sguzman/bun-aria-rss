  "description": "Episode 367 - This holiday season let's have gratitude. We get caught up in our own worlds and forget how good we really have it. 795 million people are starving in the world right now and 36 million of them will die this year of starvation. In this episode I break down the statistics around hunger in hopes of opening your eyes up to the world that we don't see, so that we can be more grateful for what we do see.<p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
