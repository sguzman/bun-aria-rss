  "description": "<p>Your TEST can become your TESTIMONY!</p> <p>In this interview, I sat down with Darryl Strawberry, one of the greatest baseball players of all time. However, we spend most of our time talking about FAITH.</p> <p>Darryl Strawberry is a world-class 8-time MLB All-Star, secured 4 World Series championships and was named rookie of the year during his 17 years in the league! But even with these great accolades, Darryl was fighting for something much more valuable; his life.</p> <p>This isn’t your regular baseball glory interview. In fact, we don’t talk much about baseball at all in this episode. This is the story of how God’s grace can work miracles in your life as we journey down Darryl’s path to redemption.</p> <p>Although Darryl was a beast on the field, his demons off the field often overshadowed even his greatest sports accolades. With ongoing suspensions from the MLB for substance abuse, dealing with the loss of his mother, and literally fighting for his life, Darryl was able to find salvation through the grace of God.</p> <p>In this interview we’re revealing it all; his childhood, the impact his alcoholic father, and how has the world at his fingertips was a catalyst to a life of addiction. I ask extremely vulnerable questions and he answers so profoundly and with all honesty. We reveal his path to recovery and how to give yourself the one thing most of us need more of in our lives; forgiveness.</p> <p>Darryl is not only a living MIRACLE but a living TESTIMONY. If you are in the trenches now, just getting out, or used to be there...this podcast is for YOU!</p> <p>If you for someone you love has struggled or continues to struggle with substance abuse, this is the EXACT sign you need to listen to this podcast. I promise it will change you.</p> <p>There’s a light about this man, he walks with the Holy Spirit, and I can’t wait for you guys to watch this because it’s not only eye-opening but heart-opening.</p>\n",
