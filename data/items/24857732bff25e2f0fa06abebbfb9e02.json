  "title": "Michael Singer: Let Go of Yourself and Surrender to Life",
  "description": "<p>Michael Singer (NYT bestselling author of <i>The Untethered Soul, The Surrender Experiment</i>, and <i>Living Untethered</i>) breaks down his life changing spiritual awakening and teaches us how to separate the consciousness from our anxieties. Mayim and Jonathan open up about how Michael’s first book brought them together after 8 years of not speaking. Michael explains why he believes his life story prior to his awakening is irrelevant and how he maintains an enlightened, centered lifestyle out in the real world. He discusses ways to create distance between you and your suffering, how to reach a state of unconditional love and spiritual growth, and provides practical examples of how to surrender one’s ego. He considers how our thought patterns and life experiences can prevent us from having our own spiritual awakenings.  </p><p>Michael Singer's New Book, <i>Living Untethered</i>: <a href=\"https://www.newharbinger.com/9781648480935/living-untethered/\">https://www.newharbinger.com/9781648480935/living-untethered/</a></p><ul><li><a href=\"https://www.bialikbreakdown.com/\">BialikBreakdown.com</a></li><li><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCTOocPnDh2YQZZwh86K2OxA\">YouTube.com/mayimbialik</a></li></ul>\n",
