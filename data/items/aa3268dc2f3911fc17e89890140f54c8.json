  "description": "<p>Does your Spanish sex hotel have special furniture for shaggin’? In this sex & travel-centric episode, comedian David Nolan falls for an exotic beauty who’s way out of his league - a Ferrari, when he’s used to a Ford Fiesta. What begins with an English lesson for a Columbian actress results in a rather unusual Thank You gift - but can his faint Irish heart keep up with all the intrigue, espionage, and adventurous group sex? Plus Bawdy’s own musical sidekick Jefferson Bergey is singing about doin’ it on public transit.
