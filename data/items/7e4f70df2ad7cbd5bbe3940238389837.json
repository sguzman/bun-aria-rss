  "description": "<p>Theoretical methods that are accurate for both short-distance observables and\nlong-wavelength collective modes are still being developed for the Hubbard\nmodel. Here, we benchmark against published diagrammatic quantum Monte Carlo\nresults an approach that combines local observables from dynamical mean-field\ntheory (DMFT) with the two-particle self-consistent theory (TPSC). This method\n(TPSC+DMFT) is relevant for weak to intermediate interaction, satisfies the\nlocal Pauli principle and allows us to compute a spin susceptibility that\nsatisfies the Mermin-Wagner theorem. The DMFT double occupancy determines the\nspin and charge vertices through local spin and charge sum rules. The TPSC\nself-energy is also improved by replacing its local part with the local DMFT\nself-energy. With this method, we find improvements for both spin and charge\nfluctuations and for the self-energy. We also find that the accuracy check\ndeveloped for TPSC is a good predictor of deviations from benchmarks. TPSC+DMFT\ncan be used in regimes where quantum Monte Carlo is inaccessible. In addition,\nthis method paves the way to multi-band generalizations of TPSC that could be\nused in advanced electronic structure codes that include DMFT.\n</p>",
