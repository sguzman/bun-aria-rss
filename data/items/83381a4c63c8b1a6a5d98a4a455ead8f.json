For each band or musician, he wanted to display a list of other\nartists that people might also be interested in.</p>\n\n<p>At the time, I think I arrogantly responded with something like “That’s easy! I\ncan think of like a dozen ways of calculating this!”. Which of course was\nprofoundly unhelpful and probably slightly infuriating. Once he calmed down,\nI sketched out how I would calculate the distance between any two artists -\nand use that distance as a ranking function to build this feature.</p>\n\n<p>Since then he has been encouraging me to write a blog post about this, \nand after a totally unreasonable delay I finally got around to finishing it\nup.  So here is my step by step guide for the non data scientist, using Python \nwith <a href=\"http://pandas.pydata.org/\">Pandas</a> and <a href=\"http://www.scipy.org/\">SciPy</a>\nto compute the distances, and <a href=\"http://d3js.org/\">D3.js</a> for building gratuitously \ninteractive visualizations.</p>\n\n<p class='more'><a href='http://www.benfrederickson.com/distance-metrics/'>Read more ...</a></p>\n     "
