  "description": "Markets are in rally mode, having risen a few percentage points in just days. But before you get too bullish, listen to what’s behind it…  On today’s show, I share why the strong start to earnings season is misleading... why the market isn’t as cheap as it looks… and why next year’s earnings estimates need to come way down.  My bearish thesis hasn't changed—and this mini rally gives us the perfect opportunity to bet against the market. Last week, I hosted an emergency briefing to share an amazing strategy for multiplying your money as stocks fall. In this episode  What’s really behind this rally [0:30] Earnings aren’t as good as they look [8:35] Why stocks can’t keep rising [19:20] The current market P/E is misleading [22:55] How to make a fortune once stocks start crashing again [34:30]  Enjoyed this episode?
