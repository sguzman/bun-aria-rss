  "description": "The internet is brutal. Martin Gurri calls it a “great mutilator.” Gurri was a global media analyst at the CIA in 2001, right as the internet erupted with what he describes as an “Information Tsunami.” That year, more information was produced than all information before it. The next year, double. Then double that, and it threw the leadership structure of the world into a “state of crisis.” Gurri wrote about it in his book, “The Revolt of the Public and the Crisis of Authority in the New Millennium,” and he joins Glenn to discuss the main issue it created, which we’re still feeling now: The old school elites aren’t the only loud voice in the room anymore. Gurri explains how many of America’s most divisive issues are all connected: cancel culture, corruption in media, nihilism, why people see white supremacists or Antifas everywhere lately. The internet created America’s great divide. But can it also bring us back together?\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
