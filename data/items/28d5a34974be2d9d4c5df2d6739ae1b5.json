  "description": "Our audiobook this week is RIDE A RANCHER by bestselling author Elle Christiansen!  \n\nNarrated by Kit Swan and Matthew Maddux\n\nSometimes the perfect person for you is the one you least expect it to be.\n\nStone Kensington is no stranger to hard work, and he knows what it takes to make a ranch a success. Determination and grit—something he figures a city girl like Helena Robinson will never have.\n\nHelena left all the shallow and fake people in her life behind to start fresh. She’s not a softie playing rancher as Stone assumes, and it doesn’t take long for her to prove it to him…and so much more.\n\nStone quickly realizes Helena is not what he thought, and she belongs to him. The only problem is Helena doesn’t believe love and marriage are for her, even though she wants to be with Stone. He’ll have to convince her that he’s for real and what they have will last.\n\nPRE-ORDER eBook (bonus epilogue) https://amzn.to/2MViQYM\n\nFOR RANCHERS ONLY by Elle Christiansen (on KU!): https://amzn.to/2NdBsC7\n\nTHE RANCHERS ROSE by Elle Christiansen (on KU!): https://amzn.to/2W95KKA\n\nElle Christiansen GIVEAWAY: http://readmeromance.com/books/ellechristensen/\n\nThe Kingmaker by Kennedy Ryan: https://amzn.to/3648ltO\n\nRough Sketch by Kate Canterbary: https://amzn.to/32LzShF\n\nTangled up in Christmas by Lisa Renee Jones: https://amzn.to/2BF0RiP\n\nCrashed Out by Tessa Bailey in Audio: https://amzn.to/2Jkca4i\n\nChapters App for iPhone: http://bit.ly/ChaptersDownload\n\nChapter App for Android: http://bit.ly/ChaptersAndroid\n\nThe Secret by Julie Garwood: https://amzn.to/2pTgikJ\n\nFollow Read Me Romance on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/readmeromance/?hl=en\n\nJoin Read Me Romance Headquarters on FB: https://www.facebook.com/groups/1681258945313004/\n\nFind Alexa Riley on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/authoralexariley/\n\nFind Tessa Bailey on Instagram: https://www.instagram.com/tessabaileyisanauthor/\n\nPodcast Credits\nRead Me Romance Theme Song by L.B.
