  "title": "Should Artists Work for Free? [71]",
  "description": "<p>This week's main topic was prompted by Alice's decision to lend a painting to a leading home decor magazine. The painting appears on the front cover this month, but some people were critical of her decision to loan the piece free of charge. &nbsp;So in this episode, we discuss whether it's OK to work for free and what criteria you might apply when deciding. We cover loans like the one Alice made as well as charitable donations, fundraising events, speeches and workshops, and we weigh up long-term brand benefits versus short-term financial gains. In the end, each artist has to decide where he or she draws the line, but we hope this conversation helps you determine what might be right for you.</p>\n<p>Mentioned:</p>\n<p>Sign up for the Connected Artist Wait List here: &nbsp;<a href=\"https://alicesheridan.com/artists/\">https://alicesheridan.com/artists/</a></p>\n<p>Sign up for our newsletters at:</p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.alicesheridan.com/podcast\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.alicesheridan.com</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.louisefletcherart.com/for-artists/podcast/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">www.louisefletcherart.com</a></p>\n<p>Submit a question at <a href=\"https://bit.ly/artjuicepodcast\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">bit.ly/artjuicepodcast</a></p>\n<p>Buy us a coffee at: <a href=\"https://ko-fi.com/artjuice\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://ko-fi.com/artjuice</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:</p>\n<p>Alice <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com@alicesheridanstudio/\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@alicesheridanstudio</a></p>\n<p>Louise <a href=\"http://www.instagram.com/louisefletcher_art\" rel=\"ugc noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">@louisefletcher_art</a></p>\n<p>Credits</p>\n<p>\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n<p><br></p>\n",
