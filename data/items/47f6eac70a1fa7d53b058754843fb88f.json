  "description": "<p>Today, we’re doing something we’ve never done before. We’re about to head into a week like never before in the US and, well, around the world. And we kinda wanted to wrap it, and you, with one big, beautiful, audio hug that reminds us all, people are good, they can be kind, even to total strangers, in ways we never imagined.</p><p>So, we’ve created a two-part series for you we’re calling The Hug, where we’re sharing a bunch of heartwarming stories, told by friends of the pod and some past guests who, now that I think about it, are friends now, too. Each story shares a moment or experience where a little bit of kindness, a little bit of sweetness and, just maybe, a little bit of lightness and laughter, touched their lives, and reminded them how good people can be. I feel like we all need a little of that right now.&nbsp;</p><p>So, today is part one of The Hug, the first 6 stories for you. We’ll air part 2 next week, right after the election with the intention of wrapping us all in the arms of stories that remind us of our shared humanity at a time we need it most. So, sit back and enjoy these stories in part one of The Hug.&nbsp;</p><p><strong>You can find our storytellers at:</strong></p><p>Gabra Zackman: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/audiobookgoddess/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a> (https://www.instagram.com/audiobookgoddess/)</p><p>Rick Charlie: <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/rick.charlie\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Facebook</a> (https://www.facebook.com/rick.charlie)</p><p>Rebekah Taussig: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/sitting_pretty/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a> (https://www.instagram.com/sitting_pretty/)</p><p>Neil Pasricha: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/neilpasricha/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a> (https://www.instagram.com/neilpasricha/)</p><p>Jeff Harry: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/jeffharryplays/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a> (https://www.instagram.com/jeffharryplays/)</p><p>Susan Piver: <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/susan.piver/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a> (https://www.instagram.com/susan.piver/)</p><br><p>-------------</p><p>Have you discovered your&nbsp;<strong>Sparketype</strong>&nbsp;yet?&nbsp;<a href=\"http://goodlifeproject.acemlna.com/lt.php?s=933dace875e063f68c8bba8022cead74&i=353A299A1A2639\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Take the Sparketype Assessment™ now.
