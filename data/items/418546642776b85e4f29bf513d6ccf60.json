  "description": "<p>Each fall, there’s a cool art and design gathering called WestEdge Design Fair in Santa Monica.  It’s held in the Barker Hanger, an enormous space at the Santa Monica airport.  This year, USModernist's <strong>George Smart</strong> moderated two panels with some of the most well-known designers from around America and the UK. What you’re about to hear is one of those panels, Epic Spaces and Favorite Places, with guests <strong>Tom Parker, Alison Pickart, David Thompson, John McClain, and Massimo Buster Minale</strong>. This is a rebroadcast of <strong>Josh Cooperman’s</strong> Convo by Design, the official podcast of WestEdge, which recorded the panel.  Many thanks to Josh and WestEdge for allowing us to share this with you directly.  Enjoy!</p>",
