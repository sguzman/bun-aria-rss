  "description": "<p>Pat is back in studio after beating Covid 19's ass, as he and the boys recap an incredible week 1 of college football including an electrifying game last night between Notre Dame and Florida State, what other games stole the show this weekend, and they look ahead to Thursday's NFL opener between the Buccaneers and Cowboys and give a couple of leans in terms of bets, if they think the Cowboys can hang with the Bucs the night they're hanging a banner, if it's a good thing that everyone is on the same page thinking the Bucs are going to dominate on Thursday, Pat hammering the anvil before the Colts host the Seahawks and Sunday and if he should take the opportunity to cut a promo on the Seahawks, Tom Brady feeling younger and better than he has in a long time, plus everything else from the college football weekend and more news from around the league. Later, Pat and AJ Hawk chat about whether or not anyone is going to be able to beat Alabama, which way they're both leaning for Thursday night, the news that the Steelers and TJ Watt haven't come to terms on an extension yet and if Steelers fans should be worried that he didn't participate in any team drills during training camp,  and they go down the list of games from the first week of NFL football and highlight some of the matchups we'll be keeping an eye on closely (38:35-1:44:13). We are so close to the start of the NFL season, so strap in, and get ready for an incredible week.
