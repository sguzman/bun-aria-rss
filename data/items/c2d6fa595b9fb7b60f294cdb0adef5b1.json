In today's episode, Dan is joined by Art Historian Temi Odumosu and popular historian James Hawes to discuss the cultural works they think reveal something vital about the history of Britain.</p><br><p>James enthuses about the Staffordshire Hoard- the largest collection of Anglo-Saxon gold ever found and what it tells us about the tumultuous political situation of the 6th century. Meanwhile, Temi explains the impact of the autobiography 'The Interesting Narrative of the Life of Olaudah Equiano the African' on the abolitionist movement in 18th century Britain. It lay the foundations for new genres of literature and new ways of understanding the experiences of enslaved people.</p><br><p>Both Temi and James appear in the new BBC series 'Art That Made Us' that through 1500 years and eight dramatic turning points presents an alternative history of the British Isles, told through art.</p><br><p>James' accompanying book to the series is called 'Brilliant Isles'.</p><br><p>If you'd like to learn more, we have hundreds of history documentaries, ad-free podcasts and audiobooks at <a href=\"https://access.historyhit.com/?utm_source=audio&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=Podcast+Campaign&utm_id=Podcast\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>History Hit</strong></a> - subscribe today!
