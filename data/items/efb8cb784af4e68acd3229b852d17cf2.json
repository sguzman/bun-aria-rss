However we can't deny the importance of security, especially when the systems are so complex!\n\nCloud applications actually become a very attractive target to a lot of hackers and this growing number of cloud native applications mostly use Kubernetes as a platform and that's where the relevance of knowing how to secure Kubernetes clusters comes into play.\n\n\n▬▬▬▬▬▬  L I N K S  🔗▬▬▬▬▬▬ \nSign up to get notified about new upcoming courses    ►  https://www.techworld-with-nana.com/course-roadmap\n\n\n▬▬▬▬▬▬ T I M E S T A M P S ⏰  ▬▬▬▬▬▬\n0:00 - Intro\n00:33 - Security in Cloud in general\n01:39 - Security in Kubernetes\n02:26 - Security as a Spectrum\n04:39 - BP 1 - Image Scanning\n09:45 - BP 2 - Run as Non-Root User\n11:08 - BP 3 - Users & Permissions with RBAC\n15:44 - BP 4 - Use Network Policies\n18:18 - BP 5 -  Encrypt Communication\n19:06 - BP 6 -  Secure  Secret Data\n20:34 - BP 7 - Secure etcd\n22:05 - BP 8 - Automated Backup & Restore\n24:54 - BP 9 - Configure Security Policies\n26:50 - BP 10 - Disaster Recovery\n\n\n▬▬▬▬▬▬ Want to learn more? 🚀  ▬▬▬▬▬▬ \nFull Python course                                            ►  https://youtu.be/t8pPdKYpowI\nFull Docker course                                            ►  https://youtu.be/3c-iBn73dDE\nFull K8s course                                                  ►  https://youtu.be/X48VuDVv0do\nDevOps Tools explained                                   ►  https://bit.ly/2W9UEq6\n\n\n▬▬▬▬▬▬ Connect with me 👋   ▬▬▬▬▬▬ \nINSTAGRAM             ►  https://bit.ly/2F3LXYJ\nTWITTER                   ►  https://bit.ly/3i54PUB\nLINKEDIN                  ►  https://bit.ly/3hWOLVT\nFB group                   ►  https://bit.ly/32UVSZP\nDEV                            ►  https://bit.ly/3h2fqiO\n\n\n▬▬▬▬▬▬ Courses & Bootcamp & Ebooks 🚀      ▬▬▬▬▬▬ \n► Become a DevOps Engineer - full educational program             👉🏼  https://bit.ly/3gEwf4V\n► High-Quality and Hands-On Courses                                             👉🏼   https://bit.ly/3nIouPW\n► Kubernetes 101 - compact and easy-to-read ebook bundle      👉🏼   https://bit.ly/3mPIaiU",
