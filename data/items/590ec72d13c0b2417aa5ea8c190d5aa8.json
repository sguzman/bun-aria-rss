    "media:description": "The Marxification of Education Workshop, Session 2 \n\nHow on Earth did education get so messed up and stolen from our society and our kids? While the critical turn in education enabled this \"transformation\" of our education system, the crucial piece that allowed it to happen is the work of a Brazilian Marxist by the name of Paulo Freire. Paulo Freire completely transformed education, not least by Marxifying it. That is, in addition to creating the conditions to swap out actual education for political education, Freire structured his understanding of education and knowledge itself as a Marxist Theory of knowing and being educated. Treating these as a special kind of bourgeois private property, Freire paved the way to abolish education entirely and to reimagine it as a system of brainwashing learners into critical Marxist consciousness. Here, New Discourses Founder James Lindsay summarizes this transformation of education itself in this second of four presentations on the Marxification of Education delivered in late July 2022 in Arlington, Virginia, on location in the now-famous Loudoun County, ground zero for the fight for America's schools. \n\nAs a result of the research that produced this lecture series, and this lecture in particular, Lindsay has written a detailed and accessible book expanding on these themes considerably, titled The Marxification of Education, which is available for preorder now: https://amzn.to/3RYZ0tY #ad\n\nSession 1: https://newdiscourses.com/2022/10/the-critical-turn-in-education/\nSession 3: https://newdiscourses.com/2022/11/groomer-schools/\n\nSupport New Discourses: https://newdiscourses.com/support\n\nSubscribe to New Discourses on other platforms: https://newdiscourses.com/subscribe\n\nFollow James Lindsay: https://linktr.ee/conceptualjames\n\n© 2022 New Discourses.
