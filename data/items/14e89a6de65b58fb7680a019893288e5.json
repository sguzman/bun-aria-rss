She’s also written a book, “An Economist Walks into a Brothel: And Other Unexpected Places to Understand Risk” that we’re diving into as well. And we’re going to discuss what risk looks like in our world today- how we should be interpreting it as individuals, as investors, and whether we should be exposing ourselves to more risk in a world that seems obsessed with the pursuit of safetyism.</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Want more How To Money in your life?
