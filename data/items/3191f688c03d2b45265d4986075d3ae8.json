  "description": "<p>A listener writes “I had 4 encounters on 3 different properties, 2 of which I know was Bigfoot and 2 that couldn’t have been anything else and nothing else makes since. All these encounters took place while deer hunting here in northeast Alabama. I also have a strange story about the balls of lights that my grandma told me about on the property we’re I had 2 of the encounters.”</p> <p>Spoke to the witness and he said “I was hunting and the neighbor had a huge dog.I thought this large dog had its back to me in the treeline and I was mad because he was going to ruin my hunt. I looked away scanning for deer and when I looked back at what I thought was the dog I was shocked. It was now standing on two legs staring at me. I was in shock and could not wrap my head around what I was looking at.”</p> <p>We are also going to speak to David and his son who had an encounter in Utah. David's son ran ahead of him on the trail and saw a creature on the trail. His son screamed and David thought he was hurt as he caught up to his son he heard something very large tearing through the woods.</p>",
