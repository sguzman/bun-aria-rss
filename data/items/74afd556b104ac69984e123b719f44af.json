  "description": "On Wednesday's Mark Levin Show, what exactly have these governors done for the citizenry? President Trump provided masks, ventilators, hospital ships and field hospitals because governors were not prepared for a pandemic. So what did Gov. Andrew Cuomo do to improve the health of New Yorkers? In fact, Cuomo, Phil Murphy and Ned Lamont ordered COVID-19 patients into the most vulnerable nursing home facilities resulting in 90% of deaths in Connecticut. Lock-downs are these governors' claim to fame and that's why they don't want to end them.These bad ideas and stay-at-home orders provide cover for Speaker Pelosi to quietly sneak her big government agenda into relief bills. \nAfterward, in yet another poor decision by Cuomo, NY State will be taxing out-of-state workers that came to flatten the curve from their home states. Then, a Texas judge is throwing the book at a women for seeing clients at her hair salon during the coronavirus quarantine. Civil rights heroes like the Rev. Dr. Martin Luther King Jr. peacefully engaged in civil disobedience to end unfair practices enforced by the government. The opposite of the Cloward-Piven strategy is to overload the bureaucracy by having all salons, barber shops and others to open-up their businesses (adhering to social distancing) and PPE (Personal Protective Equipment) guidelines, of course.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
