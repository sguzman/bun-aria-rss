  "description": "<p>Craig Finn is best known as the frontman for The Hold Steady and a successful solo artist but some of his formative years were influenced by peer pressure when it came to teenagers' favorite hobby in the nineties: Prank phone calls. On this episode we recount our own largely anticlimactic stories of receiving and making prank calls, Vanessa explains the way she views conversations between musicians from a comedian's perspective and of course we explore Craig's Cleveland connection, whether that means shaking it up in Shaker Heights as a child or playing to sparse audiences at the Euclid Tavern as an adult. Finally we once against revisit our \"Legit Moan or Unnecessary Groan\" segment, which sees us discussing if it's OK to talk at movie theatres before the previews start, if Browns fans should be ejected for standing at a football game and if income inequality can truly be blamed on the fact that Nicholas Cage reportedly sold a Superman comic book for $2.1 million dollars in 2011.One thing that we don't think you'll be complaining about is Craig's new solo album \"A Legacy Of Rentals,\" which is out now and in Jonah's constant musical rotation. Trust us, it is very good. </p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
