Great video btw!\n9:03 I watched a video where you had a custom browser homepage with all those cool Linux links, Reddits for Linux etc. Could you PLEASE share that?\n10:02 Have you thought about doing cyber security videos and do some ethical hacking related topics?\n11:36  It appears Audacium and Tenacity have died. Is there another audio editing program you recommend?\n13:48 Will you ever do a UNIX installation video?\n18:07 Thanks to the Patrons.\n\nREFERENCED:\n► Mastodon.Technology Is Shutting Down - https://ashfurrow.com/blog/mastodon-technology-shutdown/\n► The custom browser startpage from my older videos - https://gitlab.com/dwt1/dotfiles/-/tree/master/.surf\n\nWANT TO SUPPORT THE CHANNEL? \n💰 Patreon: https://www.patreon.com/distrotube \n💳 Paypal: https://www.youtube.com/redirect?event=channel_banner&redir_token=QUFFLUhqazNocEhiaGFBT1l1MnRHbnlIcHFKbXJWVnpQd3xBQ3Jtc0tsLVZJc19YeFlwZ2JqbXVOa3g0Skw4TVhTV2otNm1tM3A1bUNnamh3S2V6OGQtLTBnSjBxYTlvUXMxeEVIS3o4US10NENHMUQ3STk2a01FOFBhUnZjZFctMEhFUTg1TVctQmFfVUdxZXJ4TDl0azlYNA&q=https%3A%2F%2Fwww.paypal.com%2Fcgi-bin%2Fwebscr%3Fcmd%3D_donations%26business%3Dderek%2540distrotube%252ecom%26lc%3DUS%26item_name%3DDistroTube%26no_note%3D0%26currency_code%3DUSD%26bn%3DPP%252dDonationsBF%253abtn_donateCC_LG%252egif%253aNonHostedGuest\n🛍️ Amazon: https://amzn.to/2RotFFi\n👕 Teespring: https://teespring.com/stores/distrotube\n\nDONATE CRYPTO:\n💰 Bitcoin: 1Mp6ebz5bNcjNFW7XWHVht36SkiLoxPKoX\n🐶 Dogecoin: D5fpRD1JRoBFPDXSBocRTp8W9uKzfwLFAu\n📕 LBC: bMfA2c3zmcLxPCpyPcrykLvMhZ7A5mQuhJ\n\nDT ON THE WEB:\n🕸️ Website: http://distrotube.com/\n📁 GitLab: https://gitlab.com/dwt1  \n🗨️ Mastodon: https://fosstodon.org/@distrotube\n👫 Reddit: https://www.reddit.com/r/DistroTube/\n📽️ LBRY/Odysee: https://odysee.com/@DistroTube:2\n\nFREE AND OPEN SOURCE SOFTWARE THAT I USE:\n🌐 Brave Browser - https://brave.com/dis872 \n📽️ Open Broadcaster Software: https://obsproject.com/\n🎬 Kdenlive: https://kdenlive.org\n🎨 GIMP: https://www.gimp.org/\n🎵 Tenacity: https://github.com/tenacityteam/tenacity\n💻 VirtualBox: https://www.virtualbox.org/\n🗒️ Doom Emacs: https://github.com/hlissner/doom-emacs\n\nYour support is very much appreciated.
