  "description": "In the grand tradition of the modern rom-com, stories about queer couples are still few and far between. Which is part of what makes the new movie <em>Bros</em> so special: Billy Eichner stars as a lanky intellectual who boasts a proud aversion to romance until he has a meet-cute with his polar opposite, a hyper-masculine gym rat played by Luke Macfarlane. Eichner co-wrote the movie, and Judd Apatow is a producer, so unsurprisingly, the jokes can be broad and raunchy. But there's plenty of heart here, too.",
