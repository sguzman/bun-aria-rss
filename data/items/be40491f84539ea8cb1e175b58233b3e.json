  "description": "<p>Happy New Year! It's episode 256 and we're not judging any vegans today but we certainly are judging anyone who loves candy corn as much as Xandy. Buckle up as Em finally takes us to Savannah with the story of the Olde Pink House and some bricks that just wanted, in their soul, to be pink. Then Xandy covers a true crime case he first heard sung about in German by his father, the case of Fritz Haarmann aka the Butcher of Hanover. And please leave our peanuts alone... and that's why we drink! </p>\n",
