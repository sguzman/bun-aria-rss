  "description": "<div>From the European Stability Mechanism (ESM) to \"coronabonds\", the EU seems to be struggling to find an appropriate mechanism to tackle the economic crisis created by the COVID-19 pandemic. What is really the best option? And how do we ensure that, once the pandemic is over, we return to sustainable debt levels and competitive economies? This week, Giuseppe Porcaro is joined by Lucrezia Reichlin, professor of Economics at the London Business School, Grégory Claeys and Guntram Wolff to discuss the macroeconomic policy response to the COVID-19 crisis.<br>\n<br>\n<em>This podcast is a member of the </em><a href=\"https://www.bullemedia.eu/europod\"><em>EuroPod network</em></a><em>. </em>\n</div>\n",
