  "description": "On Thursday's Mark Levin Show, Hunter Biden is being investigated for tax crimes and false statements related to gun purchases. Ultimately it is up to the Department of Justice to decide to press charges, which may take years or if ever at all, because investigating Hunter Biden will lead to Joe Biden and all of the money his family has received from evil regimes like China. We've heard about this case for months, but it is being leaked by the DOJ now because if they can indict Hunter Biden, they want to be able to indict Donald Trump too and bee seen as fair. Also, Mark reflects on the passing of WABC radio host Bernard McGuirk. Later, Russia is finalizing the annexation of a fifth of Ukraine, and disturbing images are coming out showing the human rights violations and abuses being committed by Vladimir Putin. Torture chambers and mass execution sites are being exposed, yet the Kremlin is denying human rights abuses are occurring. This is being ignored by the media and Democrats, just as the Iranian women's uprising is being ignored. Afterward, there are no records of who has been visiting Biden at his Delaware home, but that can’t be. Have his doctors or his friends from communist China been visiting?\nLearn more about your ad choices.
