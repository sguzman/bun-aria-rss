  "description": "Today on the show, pro abortion zealots have been threatening me and wishing rape and death on my children for the past two days. I want to talk about this and explore why the defense of the unborn would provoke such a satanic reaction. Also, Tucker Carlson is yet again being unfairly attacked. We'll try to clear that up. And is it true that pro lifers don’t care about born people? Are we just \"pro birth\"? I'll put that claim to rest today. Date: 05-17-19\nLearn more about your ad choices.
