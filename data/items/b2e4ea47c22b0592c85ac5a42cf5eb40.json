It’s time for you to take control of who you are, redefine your entire personality, and reshape your identity so that you can move forward towards the future you want for yourself. On this episode of Impact Theory, Tom Bilyeu is joined by organizational psychologist and author Benjamin Hardy, PhD to discuss such matters and more as they explore why your personality and self-identity is an ever-changing thing that you have the control to reshape and reform. They discuss why most of us are trapped in our personalities, how your personality is always changing, how trauma shapes us, how to move forward in life, why your past never defines your future, the power of reframing your past and future, why pain tolerance is key to growth, how to become cognitively flexible, and how pressure creates traction to move forward in life.   Order Benjamin’s new book, ‘Personality Isn’t Permanent’:  amazon.com/dp/0593083318/ref=cm_sw_em_r_mt_dp_-ajcGb0E215DY   SHOW NOTES: Personality | Benjamin shares why the conversation needs to shift on personalities.

Wherever you’re at in the present, that’s what’s determining how you view your past.” [20:03]   “I think commitment is kind of the jumping point from courage. You know, however committed you are too something, that’s how courageous you can be, and however courageous you can be, that’s what ultimately leads you to developing flexibility, developing competencies, trying things you’ve never done and that’s how confidence is built.” [41:07]   FOLLOW BENJAMIN: Website: benjaminhardy.com Twitter: twitter.com/benjaminphardy Facebook: facebook.com/benjamin.hardy.18 Instagram: instagram.com/benjamin_hardy_phd",
