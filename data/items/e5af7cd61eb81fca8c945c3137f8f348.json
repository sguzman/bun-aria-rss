  "description": "<p>Chrissy Metz (This is Us, Breakthrough) is an American Emmy- and Golden Globe-nominated actress, singer, and producer. I sat down with Chrissy to discuss how she went from having 81 cents in her bank account to landing the lead role in NBC’s hit drama series This Is Us. She dives into why she stopped putting pressure on herself to succeed and how she dealt with people constantly telling her “no” in her life. We also got into why you should never be afraid to lose the person you’re with, how to love someone the way they need to be loved and a breakdown of fight languages vs. love languages.</p>\n",
