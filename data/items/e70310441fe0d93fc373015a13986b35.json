  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys recap everything from a wild and exhilarating Divisional Round weekend in the NFL Playoffs. They discuss Kansas City's miraculous comeback and why it is hard to count them out of any game when Patrick Mahomes starts to get things cooking. They also discuss a few of Bill O'Brien's coaching blunders during the game and decide whether or not he deserves the blame for blowing a 24 point lead on the road. The guys also dive into the Titans vs. Ravens matchup and chat about why they think this Titans team has a team of destiny feel to them, discuss why they haven't offered Derrick Henry a massive contract extension yet, give praise to Ryan Tannehill, who despite mediocre stats, has done everything the Titans have asked of him in order for them to be successful, and chat about why they think Mike Vrabel has been a HUGE difference maker for the Titans. Later, 4x Pro Bowler, 3x All-Pro, and Super Bowl Champion, Josh Sitton joins the show to discuss the Packers' huge win over the Seahawks at Lambeau on Sunday and looks ahead to the Conference Championship against San Francisco. Josh and Pat discuss the Jimmy Graham catch on 3rd down to seal the game for the Packers and how it is inexcusable that the NFL didn't have an additional camera angle to help the refs give an exact spot. Josh also recalls some stories about Aaron Rodgers from their Super Bowl run together, and why he thinks the media bashing Rodgers all year did nothing but add fuel to his fire. Josh and Pat also look ahead to the matchup with the 49ers and discuss what the Packers need to do to be successful against a very dominant, consistent football team (29:25-41:31). Pat also has some thoughts on the Browns deciding to hire Vikings OC Kevin Stefanski as Head Coach and whether or not that was the right decision, when 9ers Defensive Coordinator and other candidate for the Browns HC job, Robert Saleh dominated the coaching matchup between the two on Sunday. Pat also breaks down his thoughts on the Browns' potential GM candidate, and if all of this will equate to success in Cleveland. Lastly, Digs attempts to rework the College Football Playoff to 16 teams in order to maximize the amount of games that people will care about during Bowl Season. Today's a good one, come and laugh with us. Cheers.</p>\n",
