  "description": "<p>Meditation or medication? Today, more than ever, it’s a choice that many of us have to make.</p> <p>We live at a time of great distraction, and terrible health influences around every bend. When I walked into the restaurant where I’m writing this, I strolled past a glass case of desserts where there was a rice crispy bar made out of Fruity Pebbles that I swear called my name.</p> <p>It’s a different world, and we have different means for coping with it. Exercise, great food, great sleep, great companionship… all of those things lean towards creating a healthy, successful life. But I feel that one of the greatest tools we have available to us still isn’t talked about enough. That’s why I wanted to do this brand new episode.</p> <p>Meditation has been found to reduce your risk of heart attack (The Stroke Journal, 2009), reduce symptoms of anxiety and depression (Psychosomatic Medicine, 2009), increase focus and attention (University of Wisconsin-Madison, 2007), improve your libido (yep… The Journal of Sexual Medicine, 2009), and so much more. What medication can do all of these things? Let me answer that for you… none of them.</p> <p>Why then isn’t meditation being prescribed and utilized more often? I believe it’s due to some strange stigmas we might carry about it. I know that I was apprehensive about meditation before I knew what it actually was (and experienced the benefits). There are definitely a lot of myths about meditation that we need to clear up. So, that’s why I invited on one of the best meditation teachers in the country, Light Watkins.
