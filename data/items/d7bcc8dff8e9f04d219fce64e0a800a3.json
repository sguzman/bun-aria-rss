  "title": "Kmarko Delenda Est",
  "description": "<p>After a poorly written smear piece on Kirk Minihane appears on the Barstool Sports blog, Kirk questions how it happened and why. All answers lead to Barstool Editor-in-Chief Keith Markovich, a.k.a. Kmarko, who for some inexplicable reason hates the Kirk Minihane Show and wants to cause us harm. Kirk goes through the sophomoric attempt to produce a coherent argument on today's show and talks about his subsequent phone calls with Kmarko and Barstool Sports founder Dave Portnoy. The entire show is crystallized by the Steve's A Liar guy's beautiful song writing.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
