  "itunes:summary": "Prayer is the most important activity of your life. It is the main way in which you develop a relationship with your Father in heaven. If you love someone, naturally you will want to spend time in their presence communicating with them. Like any relationship, communication can take many different forms.\nLancelot Andrewes (1555–1626), was one of the great theologians and preachers of his day. After he died, his private notebook on prayer was discovered and published. In it he had written two lists:\nFirst, he wrote a list of times of prayer in the Bible:\n‘Always...\nWithout ceasing...\nAt all times...\nThree times a day...\nEvening, and morning, and at noon...\nSeven times a day...\nIn the morning, a great while before day...\nAt daybreak...\nThe third hour of the day...\nAbout the sixth hour...\nThe hour of prayer, the ninth...\nThe evening...\nBy night...\nAt midnight...’\nNext, he wrote a list of places of prayer in the Bible:\n‘In the assembly... and in the congregation...\nYour closet...\nAn upper room...\nA housetop...\nThe temple...\nOn the shore...\nA garden...\nOn their beds...\nA desert place...\nIn every place...’\nThere is no limit to the times, places and different ways in which you can pray.",
