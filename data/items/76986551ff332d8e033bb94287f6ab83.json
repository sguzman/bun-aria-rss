  "description": "<p>After an Introduction to the themes of Enriques surfaces and Rationality\nquestions, the Artin-Mumford counterexample to Lueroth problem is revisited. A\nconstruction of it is given, which is related in an explicit way to the\ngeometry of Enriques surfaces, more precisely to the special family of Reye\ncongruences and their classical geometry.\n</p>",
