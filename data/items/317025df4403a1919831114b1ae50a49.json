  "description": "On Monday's Mark Levin Show, the fake news media is the enemy of the people. There isn't a single area of life where the left promotes liberty except immorality and debauchery. It’s a constant battle between liberty and tyranny. Once people cease to acknowledge why their country was founded eventually the country will cease to exist. The 1619 Project is a diabolical deliberate effort to rewrite history, similar to the way they ignored the Holocaust. The New York Times embraces anti-Semitism and the biased anti-historical 1619 propaganda. The entire project is based on the narrow ideology of neo-liberalism and liberal guilt that promotes the tropes that America was built in slavery and that slavery and racism are inherent to Americanism. Sadly, none of the most prominent historians and scholars were not included in this project, but deference was given to the World Socialist website. The New York Times has become a mixture between MSNBC and the National Enquirer. Later, Washington's latest think tank is sponsored by radical libertarian Charles Koch and leftwing mega-donor George Soros. The Quincy Institute supports open borders the Iran deal and Koch has indicated that he may not support Trump in 2020. Afterword, Senator Warren makes another call to destroy the electoral college, which is typical of the left to destroy that with which they don't agree.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
