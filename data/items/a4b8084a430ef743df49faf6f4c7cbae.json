  "description": "<p>This week on The Literary Life Podcast, our hosts are continuing their discussion of Robert Louis Stevenson’s <em>The Strange Case of Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Hyde.</em> If you missed last week’s episode, you will want to go back and catch <a href= \"https://www.theliterary.life/105/\">Part 1 here</a>. Angelina kicks of the book chat with a look at the format of the story and how it keeps us in suspense. Thomas brings up the idea of forbidden knowledge found in this book and the similarities between it and <em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3927c8Q\">Frankenstein</a></em>. Some other topics covered in this episode include the dangers of dehumanizing victims of crime, the nature of sin and addiction, the Renaissance idea of the well-ordered man, and the mythic qualities of this story.</p> <p>Be sure to check out Thomas’ class on The French Revolution and other fall webinars at <a href= \"https://houseofhumaneletters.com/webinars/\">House of Humane Letters</a>. Don’t forget to check out our sister podcast, <a href= \"https://www.theliterary.life/the-well-read-poem/\">The Well Read Poem</a>, as well as Cindy’s new podcast, <a href= \"https://thenewmasonjar.com\">The New Mason Jar</a>! We will be back here on The Literary Life in two weeks with our first in a series of episodes on Jane Austen’s <em><a href= \"https://amzn.to/3Ca2D93\">Mansfield Park</a></em>.</p> <h3>Commonplace Quotes:</h3> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>One beautiful starry-skied evening, we two stood next to each other at a window, and I, a young man of about twenty-two who had just eaten well and had good coffee, enthused about the stars and called them the abode of the blessed. But the master grumbled to himself: “The stars, hum! hum! The stars are only a gleaming leprosy in the sky.”</p> <cite>Heinrich Heine</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>It is a mistake, perhaps, to think that, to do one thing well, we must just do and think about that and nothing else all the time. It is our business to know all we can and to spend a part of our lives in increasing our knowledge of Nature and Art, of Literature and Man, of the Past and the Present. That is one way in which we become greater persons, and the more a person is, the better he will do whatever piece of special work falls to his share. Let us have, like Leonardo, a spirit ‘invariably royal and magnanimous.’</p> <cite>Charlotte Mason</cite></blockquote> <blockquote class=\"wp-block-quote\"> <p>The poet’s job is not to tell you what happened, but what happens: not what did take place, but the kind of thing that always takes place.</p> <cite>Northrup Frye</cite></blockquote> <h3>The Land of Nod</h3> <p><em>by Robert Louis Stevenson</em></p> <p>From breakfast on through all the day<br /> At home among my friends I stay,<br /> But every night I go abroad<br /> Afar into the land of Nod.</p> <p>All by myself I have to go,<br /> With none to tell me what to do —<br /> All alone beside the streams<br /> And up the mountain-sides of dreams.</p> <p>The strangest things are there for me,<br /> Both things to eat and things to see,<br /> And many frightening sights abroad<br /> Till morning in the land of Nod.</p> <p>Try as I like to find the way,<br /> I never can get back by day,<br /> Nor can remember plain and clear<br /> The curious music that I hear.</p> <h3>Book List:</h3> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/2VEyCP4\">Ourselves</a></em> by Charlotte Mason</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3tyIYfV\">The Educated Imagination</a></em> by Northrup Frye</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/3927c8Q\">Frankenstein</a></em> by Mary Shelley</p> <p><em><a href=\"https://amzn.to/391AcxC\">The Hobbit</a></em> by J.
