  "description": "<p><em><strong>Image - Part Four: Space. </strong></em>Today we continue our series on Imaging, focusing on the words of Ephesians 2:8-10: <em>\"For it is by </em><em><strong>grace</strong></em><em> you have been </em><em><strong>saved</strong></em><em>, through </em><em><strong>faith</strong></em><em>—and this is not from yourselves, it is the gift of God—&nbsp;not by </em><em><strong>works</strong></em><em>, so that no one can boast. For we are God’s handiwork, created in Christ Jesus to do good works, which God prepared in advance for us to do.”</em> How does the language in Genesis shape the human imaging project? How does worship factor in? What is the chaos God subdues? How does it come to define us and creation??</p>\n<p>Mike and Tim also answer follow up questions on short term missions trips from the previous episodes.</p>\n<p>As always, we encourage and would love discussion as we pursue.
