Our colleague Dr Kate Cronin-Furman, who is Lecturer in Human Rights and Director of the MA in Human Rights here at UCL, conducts research into the experiences of victims of civil war violence. One of her recently published papers, co-authored with Roxani Krystalli from the University of St Andrews, focuses on the relatives of people who have been ‘disappeared’ during conflict. Drawing on deep field research in Sri Lanka and Colombia, it examines how those relatives seek justice and recognition, and how they try to keep the memories of their missing loved ones alive.</p><p><strong>Host: </strong>Professor Jennifer Hudson</p><p>Dr Kate Cronin-Furman</p><p><i><strong>‘</strong></i><a href=\"https://journals.sagepub.com/doi/full/10.1177/1354066120946479\"><i><strong>The things they carry: Victims’ documentation of forced disappearance in Colombia and Sri Lanka’</strong></i></a></p>\n",
