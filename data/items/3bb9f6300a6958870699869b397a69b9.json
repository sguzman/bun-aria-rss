  "itunes:summary": "Mark Andrejevic’s recent book Automated Media considers the politics of automation through the “cascading logics” of pre-emption, operationalism, and “framelessness”. Together with artist Sean Dockray, legal scholar James Parker, and curator Joel Stern, Mark talks through some of these ideas, along with the limits of “surveillance capitalism” as an analytic frame, “touchlessness” in the time of Covid, “operational listening”, what automation is doing to subjectivity… and how all this relates to reality TV.\n\nhttps://machinelistening.exposed/curriculum/\n\nFinancial support from patrons at any level has a resounding impact on our work. You can support Liquid Architecture’s weekly podcast and our online journal Disclaimer, for new thinking and writing on listening and sound through a Patreon subscription, for as little as $5 a month. \n\nhttps://www.patreon.com/liquidarchitecture\n\nFor the past 20 years, Liquid Architecture has been Australia’s leading organisation for artists working with sound and listening. LA investigates the sounds themselves, but also the ideas communicated about, and the meaning of, sound and listening.",
