  "description": "<p>Today’s guest is Mary McCartney, the star of <i>Mary McCartney Serves It Up</i>, a charming series on Discovery+. On the show, Mary shares her favorite plant-based recipes and entertaining tips while cooking along with some guests you might recognize, such as Oprah, the Foo Fighters’ Dave Grohl, and Mary’s dad, the one and only Paul McCartney. As Mary explains to host Kerry Diamond, the show is a bit of a transition for her. A well-known portrait photographer, Mary is used to being on the other side of the camera and has photographed everyone from Harry Styles to Taylor Swift to Queen Elizabeth. But food has played a central role in her life. Her mother, the late Linda McCartney, was an early proponent of vegetarianism, and Mary, along with her father and her sister, the fashion designer Stella McCartney, helped launch Meat Free Mondays more than a decade ago. Mary has also written several cookbooks, including <i>At My Table: Vegetarian Feasts for Family and Friends</i>. </p><p>Today’s episode is presented by Fridge No More. </p><p>Radio Cherry Bombe is recorded at Newsstand Studios at Rockefeller Center.
