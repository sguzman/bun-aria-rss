  "description": "<p><p>Professors at the University of Kansas are trying to run Chick-fil-a off campus in the name of inclusivity, but Kirk Minihane just wants some waffle fries with a side of good Christ-like politeness. The humorless \"journalist\" class collects another scalp over a three-year-old Facebook joke. Blind Mike's mom is fair game again now that he's got a lucrative contract from Barstool Sports. Minihane is starting to think Steve Robinson is a psychopath. The boys have decided on a new network television show to watch together. Plus, Blind Mike's got a new podcast idea.Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
