  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">The American church talks a lot about the family. Some might say we’re focused on it, but is that right? The podcast crew discusses a provocative new article by conservative columnist, David Brooks, about our society’s focus on the small nuclear family (mom, dad, and kids), why they’re unsustainable, and why extended family groups have always been the norm in human societies. World Relief’s Matthew Soerens is back for the second part of his interview about the state of refugees, and Skye talks about the racial history of America’s immigration policy. Also this week: Phil’s animal stories—car-sized turtles, the real-life Disney baboon, lazy salamanders, and talking penguins.</p>",
