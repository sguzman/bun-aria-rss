  "description": "<p>When was the last time you got lost in a book? If it’s been a minute, today’s guest might recommend you visit a local library or bookstore ASAP. Michelle Kuo is a teacher, lawyer, writer who is passionate about reading in communities with other people, whether that's through book clubs or in prisons. In this episode, we talk about how reading skills reveal the bridging power of the written word -- as well as the limitations of its power. In 2017, she released “Reading with Patrick”, a memoir of teaching reading in a rural county jail in Arkansas. The book explores Michelle’s relationship with a former student, Patrick, whom she wrote and read with, prompting questions about what we owe each other in a world where economic and racial inequality determine life outcomes.
