  "description": "Fictions is a collection of short stories by Argentine writer Jorge Luis Borges. In the mid-20th century, Latin American literature gained a worldwide audience, in part thanks to Borges. His works popularized the idea that literature coming from Latin America cannot be reduced to tropical fantasies or realist depictions of exotic worlds. Mariano Siskind is a professor of Romance Languages and Literatures and Comparative Literature at Harvard University. Some of his research interests include 19th and 20th century Latin American Literature, theories of globalization, and psychoanalysis. He has written books such as Deseos cosmopolitas and Historia del Abasto. See more information on our website, WritLarge.fm. Follow us on Twitter @WritLargePod.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
