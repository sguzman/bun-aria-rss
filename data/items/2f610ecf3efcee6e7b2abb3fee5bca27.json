  "description": "<p class=\"p1\">Conservatives have recently found a new boogeyman—Critical Theory. Even Mr. Trump has issued an executive order declaring Critical Theory to be “anti-American,” and last week the presidents of six Southern Baptist seminaries said critical theory is incompatible with Christianity. Their statement, however, never defined what Critical Theory is nor what makes it unchristian. Theologian David Fitch is back to talk about the controversy and offers a more thoughtful way to assess which aspects of Critical Theory are useful, and not so useful, for Christians. Kaitlyn Schiess is also back with Phil and Skye to talk about the SBC’s response, and why white evangelicals see some evils as personal (racism) and others as systemic (abortion)? Are there similar inconsistencies on the political left as well? Also this week: Portland pastor Rick McKinley says nationalism with Jesus’ face is the religion of white Christians. That’s not too risky to say in Portland, but what if you’re a pastor in Dallas?<span class= \"Apple-converted-space\"> </span> Plus, can we please stop sharing “unspoken” prayer requests?</p> <p class=\"p2\"> </p> <p class=\"p3\"><span class=\"s1\"><a href= \"https://religionnews.com/2020/12/01/southern-baptist-seminary-presidents-nix-critical-race-theory/\"> <strong>https://religionnews.com/2020/12/01/southern-baptist-seminary-presidents-nix-critical-race-theory/</strong></a></span></p> <p class=\"p2\"> </p> <p class=\"p3\"><a href= \"https://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/2020/12/the-new-religion-of-white-christians-steve-duin-column.html\"> <strong>https://www.oregonlive.com/opinion/2020/12/the-new-religion-of-white-christians-steve-duin-column.html</strong></a></p>",
