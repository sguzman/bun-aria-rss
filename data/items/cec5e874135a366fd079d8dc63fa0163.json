  "description": "Writer and director, Michael Mann, talks to Adam one on one about his new book ‘Heat 2: A Novel’, the sequel/prequel to his infamous 1995 film, ‘Heat’. Michael explains he wrote the book because the characters never stopped being alive for him and he couldn’t seem to get them out of his head. Adam remembers loving his 1986 movie ‘Manhunter’ where Brian Cox played Dr. Hannibal Lecktor and Michael tells him the story of how that almost didn’t happen. The two discuss how they pick which projects to actually pursue since there is never enough time to do them all. Michael gives Adam an update on the filming of his next movie ‘Ferrari’ in Italy and the two discuss the life of Enzo Ferrari. \n\nTHANKS FOR SUPPORTING TODAY’S SPONSORS:\n\nGeico.com\n\nCon-Cret.com/PODCAST\n\nStamps.com enter ADAM\n\nBetterHelp.com/CAROLLA\n\nThe Jordan Harbinger Show",
