Next is another installment of McAfee & Hawk Sports Talk, as Pat and AJ discuss the rumor that ESPN is considering moving friend of the program Kirk Herbstreit and Chris Fowler into the Monday Night Football Booth, the UFC continuing to put fights on on a private island, Pat details life in the NFL substance abuse program, and they both reflect on the Senior Bowl (32:23-2:04:14). Next, 2x Pro Bowler, and now the highest paid TE in NFL history, Austin Hooper joins the show. Austin and Pat chat about why drew him to Cleveland, and the culture that new GM Andrew Berry and Head Coach Kevin Stefanski are trying to build with the Browns, the kind of work that goes in to making him great, what it was like going to Stanford, and what he’s been doing during the quarantine in order to keep his body in shape and get ready for next season (2:04:14-2:16:31). Lastly, former NXT Champion, and NXT Tag Team Champion, and more of the most entertaining performers in sports entertainment, Tommaso Ciampa joins Pat and the boys via FaceTime.
