  "description": "<div>This week the hosts are joined by Andy of Harry Potter Fan Zone, and Chapter by Chapter continues with chapters 13 and 14 of Sorcerer's Stone. Listen as we discuss the real-life origins of Nicolas Flamel, debate whether 'Sorcerer's Stone' or 'Philosopher's Stone' is a better title, and revisit a fan theory about what Dumbledore did with alchemy. Then, the trio visit Hagrid's Hut and Harry uses his powers of persuasion that he may or may not have inherited from Voldemort?! All this and more, including:<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n<ul>\n<li>Welcome back, Andy!

What if it's magically infected?</li>\n<li>The scene with Charlie's friends is unspoilt by adaptation.
