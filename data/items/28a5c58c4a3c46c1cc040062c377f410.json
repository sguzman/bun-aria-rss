  "description": "Phil, Jase, and Al laugh their way through solving the mysterious case of the missing Wisconsin cheese. They're not exactly sure how 100 pounds of Phil's cheese made its way to Al's house, but they're delighted (and relieved) to discover that yes, eating cheese is biblical! Jase heads out to do some metal detecting and comes back with an eight-legged passenger in his navel.
