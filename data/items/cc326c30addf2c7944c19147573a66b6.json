He also draws our attention to Paul’s treatment of God the Father and God the Son as equal but not the same. This sheds light on Paul’s conversation about head coverings for women in our reading from 1 Corinthians and reassures female believers about their roles in marriage and the Church. Today’s readings are Acts 15, 1 Corinthians 11-12, Proverbs 28:10-12.",
