  "description": "<p>During Easter of 2013, 37-year-old Ryan Blagojevic disappeared from the central harbor area of Portland, Maine. He had struggled with alcohol as a teen but when he suffered a severe brain injury in an accident a few years prior to his disappearance, it led to a more serious dependence on alcohol. Ryan had lived in the area for around two years— on the streets and in and out of shelters, so specifics about his life at this time are vague. What is known however, is that on the evening of March 31, 2013, he was intoxicated, kicked out of a shelter and the police were called. After they spoke with him and he went on his way — Ryan was never seen again.</p><p>If you have information about Ryan’s disappearance, please call Detective Chris Giesecke at the Portland Maine Police Dept. at (207) 874-8593.</p><p>You can follow Ryan's case on Facebook at <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/missingryanblagojevic/\" target=\"_blank\">Missing Ryan Blagojevic</a>.</p><p>The episode was co-researched and written by Marissa Jones and&nbsp;<a href=\"http://agpstories.com/\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Anna Priestland</strong></a><strong>.</strong></p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href=\"http://stamps.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Stamps.com</a>- Go to&nbsp;<a href=\"http://stamps.com/\" target=\"_blank\">Stamps.com</a>&nbsp;and click on the radio microphone at the top of the homepage and type&nbsp;<u>Vanished </u>for a 4-week trial PLUS free postage and a digital scale with no longterm commitment.</p><p><a href=\"https://www.daily-harvest.com\" target=\"_blank\">Daily Harves</a>t- Go to <a href=\"https://www.daily-harvest.com\" target=\"_blank\">daily-harvest.com</a> and enter promo code VANISHED to get three free cups in your first box.</p><p><strong><em>You can find new episodes of&nbsp;The&nbsp;Vanished, completely ad-free, only on&nbsp;Stitcher&nbsp;Premium.&nbsp;For&nbsp;a free month of&nbsp;Stitcher&nbsp;Premium, go to&nbsp;</em></strong><a href=\"http://stitcherpremium.com/wondery\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>stitcherpremium.com/wondery</em></strong></a><strong><em>&nbsp;and use promo code WONDERY.</em></strong></p><p><br></p><p><br></p><p>See Privacy Policy at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy</a> and California Privacy Notice at <a href=\"https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info</a>.</p>",
