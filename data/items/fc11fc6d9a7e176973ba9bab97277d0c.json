  "description": "In Episode #220, Dr MeiLan Han joins me to discuss the lungs and respiratory system.\nDespite being an incredibly important factor of our overall health, the respiratory system is often overlooked. Most people’s knowledge is surface level, and we aren’t educated on the importance of the lungs or how to best support respiratory health. Dr MeiLan Han joins me in this episode to explain what the respiratory system is, how it works, and what we can do to optimise it.\nIn this episode, Dr Han establishes what the respiratory system is and how it works. We discuss the prevalence of lung conditions, Covid-19 and its impact on the respiratory system, and air quality. We also discuss healthy habits for pregnancy, the effects of smoking and vaping on lung health, diet, and how to reduce exposure to toxic compounds.\n\nSpecifically, we cover:\n\nIntro (0:00)\n\nBreathing Lessons: The Book (2:09)\n\nMeilan’s Story (5:59)\n\nImportance of Lung Awareness (11:07)\n\nLung Tests (24:25)\n\nImpact of Covid (29:57)\n\nHow the Lungs Work (33:32)\n\nChildhood Lung Health (44:52)\n\nAir Quality (53:55)\n\nCleansing the Lungs (1:15:20)\n\nCOPD (1:19:47)\n\nFinal Thoughts (1:27:32)\n\nOutro (1:29:35)\n\n\nIf you are interested in learning more about lung health, Dr Han’s book is the perfect resource.
