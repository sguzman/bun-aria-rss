We talk about the influence of digital technology on music consumption and production including midi formats and autotune. The discussion touches on Nick's work on how iPods have changed the way in which we experience public space. Nick also tells me about his latest work on the \"crowdsourced\" Japanese \"virtual popstar\" Hatsune Miku. You can find Nick on Twitter @nickprior4\n",
