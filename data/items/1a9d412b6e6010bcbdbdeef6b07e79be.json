  "description": "<p>The Four Remembrances (2019-03-27) - When we attune to the reality of impermanence and death, we remember what most matters to us. But in daily life we can lose precious swaths of time in a reactive trance, on our way somewhere else, and lost in problem solving, judgment and worry. This talk reflects on four remembrances or practices - Pausing, Yes to life, Turning toward love, and Resting in awareness - that help us awaken from trance and live true to the loving presence that is our essence.</p> <p>Your support enables us to continue to offer these talks and meditations freely. If you value them, I hope you will consider offering a donation at this time at <a href= \"https://www.tarabrach.com/donation/\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">www.tarabrach.com/donation/</a>.</p> <p>With gratitude and love, Tara</p>",
