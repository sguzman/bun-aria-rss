  "description": "<p>In my book <em>The Lazy Genius Way,</em> I share 13 principles you can use to Lazy Genius any situation in your life. Sometimes you might need one principle, sometimes a few together, and sometimes you don’t know which to choose. When you’re faced with some sort of challenge whether it’s a system in your home, a relationship hangup, a time management problem, whatever it might be, even with 13 principles to choose from, sometimes that still seems like a lot. Hopefully, this episode will give you a tangible framework for how to choose the right Lazy Genius principle for you.</p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Helpful Companion Links</strong></h3><ul><li>Grab a copy of <a href=\"https://amzn.to/336mj1e\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>The Lazy Genius Way</em></strong></a><strong> </strong>(or preorder <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3eWnC5o\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong><em>The Lazy Genius Kitchen</em></strong></a> — out March 22!)</li><li><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/p/CTXVqx0ncof/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Principle Categories Instagram post</strong></a></li><li><a href=\"/s/244-How-to-Choose-the-Right-Lazy-Genius-Principle-for-You.pdf\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>Download a transcript of this episode.</strong></a></li></ul><p><br></p><p><br></p><h3><strong>Lazy Genius of the Week: Paula Kay Myers</strong></h3><blockquote>Love <a href=\"https://www.thelazygeniuscollective.com/lazy/soup\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\"><strong>the soup podcast</strong></a> and need to share with you my LG gift idea.
