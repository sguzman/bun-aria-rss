It is rather a question of saving your lives and not resisting those who are far too strong for you.”</em> — Athenian embassy to Melos via Thucydides&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\"><em>“Don’t quote laws to men who carry swords.”</em> — Pompey the Great&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\"><em>“The present policy of the Government is but a continuation of the same progressive change by a milder process. The tribes which occupied the countries now constituting the Eastern States were annihilated or have melted away to make room for the whites.” —</em> Andrew Jackson&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\"><em>“And do you know what “the world” is to me? Shall I show it to you in my mirror? This world: a monster of energy, without beginning, without end… This world is the will to power—and nothing besides!” —</em> Friedrich Nietzsche&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">In the midst of The Peloponnesian War (431-401 BCE), the Athenians paid a visit to the inhabitants of the island of Melos and tried to make them an offer they couldn’t refuse. The dialogue that emerged from their negotiations is a classic in political philosophy, and raises fascinating questions about the nature of morality in history. In this episode, Darryl Cooper (from “The Martyrmade Podcast”) and I tackle them all, and leave no stones unturned.&nbsp;</p><p class=\"\">This episode is sponsored by article.com.
