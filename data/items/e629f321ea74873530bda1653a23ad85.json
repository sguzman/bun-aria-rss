This week on <em>Eat Your Words</em>, guest host Erin Fairbanks is turning the table on Cathy Erway, chatting with her about her brand new book “The Food of Taiwan.” Possibly the only cookbook to open up with a tale of an assassination attempt, Cathy goes on to explain how she came to be inspired to shine the light on this intriguing part of the world as well as her personal connection to the cuisine.

After the break, book photographer Pete Lee joins the show and shares his thoughts on the beautiful landscape that Taiwan provided for the visual base of the book before aiding Cathy in describing a few recipes featured.
