  "description": "“If old England is not by this lesson taught humility, then she is an obstinate old slut, bent upon her ruin.”\nThis is the story of 1777. Playboy and playwright \"Gentleman Johnny\" is leading a Canadian-based invasion of upstate New York (seriously, why are those Canadians so militaristic?). It's a tale of egos. From Gentleman Johnny to the American side, a lot of dudes are looking out for \"number one.\" The outcome of Gentleman Johnny's invasion helps Ben Franklin score a full-on military alliance avec la France. \nMeanwhile, George Washington throws down with General Howe in PA. George loses battles; Howe loses his dog. George is also about to throw down with haters in military leadership and Congress. He'll do so while facing the harsh cold at Valley Forge.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
