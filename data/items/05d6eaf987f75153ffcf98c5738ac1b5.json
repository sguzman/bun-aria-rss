After losing her father she wanted to know more about life after death. This hunger for knowledge led her to the world of ghost hunting and paranormal research. Quickly she found herself obsessed with proving that the spirit world isn’t as scary as many think. For over twelve years, she and her crew at the Oddity Files have investigated some of the most infamous haunted locations in the world and come away with evidence that will prove to you, that not only are these locations haunted, but these spirits have a story to tell us. <br>\n<br>\nGet the book here: <a href=\"https://amzn.to/3qe9JDc\">https://amzn.to/3qe9JDc</a> </p>\n",
