  "description": "Are the Bears good? Are the Rams? They might be some of the main takeaways after an uninspiring Monday Night Football matchup. Will Brinson is joined by Ryan Wilson and John Breech to make this recap interesting. To be honest, game specifics aren't covered as much as normal in favor of quarterback and coaching tree hypotheticals. Who should Chicago have targeted instead of Nick Foles this offseason? Is Matt Nagy overmatched? And let's not forget an unbelievable performance from punter Johnny Hekker in this game, something to keep Breech happy for weeks. The Rams are firmly in the playoff conversation, but they still might be the worst team in their division.
