  "title": "238 - Jesus Was Jewish - with Dr. Amy-Jill Levine",
  "description": "Today we sit down with Dr Amy-Jill Levine, professor and world renowned scholar for her work in New Testament Studies.  AJ (as she affectionally insists we call her!) is the author of over ten books about Jesus and his Jewish background.  AJ brings an authentic knowledge of Judaism in the first century, as well as her own Jewish heritage to inform her writings.  \n\nIn this interview, Mike and Tim converse with AJ all about the essential Jewishness of Jesus and why it matters to an accurate understanding of the text.  With wit and humor, AJ dispels some misconceptions about Judaism and how often a good picture of Jesus is built upon a poor view of Judaism.  AJ demonstrates how this is not only unnecessary, but calls into question one’s own Christology.  \n\nIf you want to know more about Dr. Levine and her work at Vanderbilt University, please click here: https://divinity.vanderbilt.edu/people/bio/amy-jill-levine\n\nMike and Amy discuss her book, The Jewish Annotated New Testament which can be found here: shorturl.at/jC347\n\nAlong with her work written with Ben Witherington III, called “The Gospel of Luke” here: shorturl.at/jx469\n\nIn addition, you can find more of her books including children’s stories about the parable of Jesus here: shorturl.at/BDIKN\n\nLearn more about the VOX Podcast:\nwww.voxpodcast.com\n\nSubscribe on iTunes - apple.co/1Lla1Nj\nSupport the VOX Podcast on Patreon:\n\nwww.patreon.com/voxpodcast\n\nFollow us on Instagram: @voxpodcast\nLike us on Facebook: www.facebook.com/voxpodcast\nFollow Mike on Twitter: www.twitter.com/mikeerre\n\nMusic in this episode by Timothy John Stafford\nwww.timothyjohnstafford.com\nInstagram & Twitter: @GoneTimothy\n",
