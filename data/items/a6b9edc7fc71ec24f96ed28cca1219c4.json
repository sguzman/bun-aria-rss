  "description": "<div>The gals explore some of the ways your undying love can seriously backfire on you--or your partner. We dig into the neurology of love and aggression, then explore some individual crimes of passion from across the pond and right here in the U.S. Grab a bottle of The Affair Pinot Noir and prepare your ears for some hideous French pronunciations, even worse British accents, and the alarming similarities between severed penises and Pizza Rolls.<br>\n<br>\n\n</div>\n",
