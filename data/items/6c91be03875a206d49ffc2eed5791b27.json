Deloitte's stil saying little, but other people are talking. The SEC tells the Senate it's \"deeply concerned\" about its own breach. Popular iOS and Android stock-trading apps are found vulnerable. Sonic drive-ins have sustained what looks like a pretty big breach. Ben Yelin discusses a bipartisan bill to improve IoT security. Isaac Kohen from Teramind on detecting employees involved in radical political activities on company time. Russian influence operations against the US are turning toward local government, religious groups, civic associations and others at the grassroots. \n Thanks for listening to the CyberWire. One of the ways you can support what we do is by visiting our sponsors.\n Recorded Future's user conference RFUN 2017 comes to Washington, D.C. , October 4th and 5th, 2017, bringing together the people who put the act in actionable intelligence.\n If you’d like to learn more about how small nuances in how artificial intelligence and machine learning are used can make a big difference, check out E8’s white paper\n If you want to execute at machine speed, doesn’t make sense to see what the algorithms a good machine runs on can do for you?
