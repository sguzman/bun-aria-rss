RA, Whits, and Grinnelli also discuss both Conference Finals series, Nashville's delusional anthem singer who is legit mad about being bumped by country superstars, the stellar play of Craig Anderson, players deciding to play with a concussion, the NHL's list of the 20 Greatest NHL Teams, and more.
