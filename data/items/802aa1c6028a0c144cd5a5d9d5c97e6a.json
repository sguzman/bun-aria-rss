Khan, who was rushed to the hospital after the incident, has been attempting to mount a political comeback after being ousted from power in April.</p>\n<p>As Khan spoke to his supporters from the back of a truck, a gunman in the crowd opened fire. According to multiple media reports, the former PM was either hit in the foot or the leg.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Khan was rushed to a hospital in Lahore, around 100 kilometers (60 miles) away. One of Khan&rsquo;s aides, Raoof Hasan, told AFP that the former leader is in <em>&ldquo;stable condition.&rdquo;</em>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><em>&ldquo;This was an attempt to kill him, to assassinate him,&rdquo;</em> Hasan added. A suspect has been arrested, Pakistan&rsquo;s Geo TV reported shortly afterwards.</p>\n\n            <blockquote class=\"twitter-tweet\"><p lang=\"en\" dir=\"ltr\">The actual video of <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/firing?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#firing</a> on <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hashtag/ImranKhanLongMarch?src=hash&ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">#ImranKhanLongMarch</a> !! <a href=\"https://t.co/QfK2GipIFU\">pic.twitter.com/QfK2GipIFU</a></p>&mdash; Saqib Virk (@SaqibVirkPK) <a href=\"https://twitter.com/SaqibVirkPK/status/1588142903972564992?ref_src=twsrc%5Etfw\">November 3, 2022</a></blockquote> <script async src=\"https://platform.twitter.com/widgets.js\" charset=\"utf-8\"></script>\n    \n\n<p>Khan is a former cricketer who served as Pakistan&rsquo;s prime minister from 2018 until his removal from office after a no-confidence motion in April this year.

Last month, the Election Commission of Pakistan barred Khan from running or serving as a member of parliament for five years, claiming that the ex-PM had failed to properly report gifts received while in office. Khan, who still leads the PTI party, insists he is being persecuted on political grounds.&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Thursday&rsquo;s shooting took place a week into a protest march led by Khan from Lahore to Islamabad. Stopping to hold rallies along the route, the PTI leader has been demanding fresh elections, buoyed by his party&rsquo;s victories in six out of eight by-elections it contested last month.</p>",
