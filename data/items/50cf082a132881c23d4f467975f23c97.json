  "description": "<p><strong>Richard Neutra</strong> was one of the world’s most important architects, and today his work is even more popular.  Neutra designed more than 300 amazing Modernist houses in California and elsewhere. In 1949, Time Magazine featured Neutra on its cover and ranked him second only to <strong>Frank Lloyd Wright</strong> in American architecture. Neutra hired several architects who went on to independent success, including <strong>Gregory Ain</strong>, <strong>Harwell Hamilton Harris</strong>, and <strong>Raphael Soriano</strong>.  Our first guest is Neutra’s son and a good friend of the podcast, <strong>Raymond Neutra</strong>, who has been traveling the world photographing his father’s houses.  He is author of Cheap and Thin: Neutra and Frank Lloyd Wright.</p> <p>Joining Raymond is <strong>Barbara Lamprecht</strong>, one of the world’s foremost experts on Richard Neutra’s architecture.  If you’ve been in any Modernist house worth talking about, you’ve seen one of her Neutra books on the Noguchi or Nelson coffee table.  She is an architect and architectural historian and a kind of forensic examiner, performing environmental reviews, and applying for the National Register of Historic Places, National Historic Landmarks, and Mills Act programs. She specializes in Modernism and has appeared in the documentaries GlobeTrekker, Visual Acoustics, and Coast Modern.</p>",
