  "description": "Today on the Matt Walsh Show, the LGBT Netflix employees finally held their big walkout yesterday to protest Dave Chappelle and biological science. Only it wasn’t big. Just a small assortment of people gathered for the demonstration. Many on the Right think that the pathetic turnout was a failure and an embarrassment for the Left. But I think they’re missing the point completely. Also, the State Department celebrates national pronouns day, and Donald Trump launches his own social media platform. Is it on its way to wild success, or doomed to failure? Plus, the WNBA holds a parade in Chicago yesterday and you have to see the footage to really appreciate it. In our Daily Cancellation, I must cancel a Republican candidate for a political ad that you must be careful watching, as it may cause a fatal case of the cringe.\nYou petitioned, and we heard you.
