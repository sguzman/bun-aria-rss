  "description": "<p>This week, in Holladay, Utah, a prominent woman is viciously killed in her own home, and investigators have very little to work with, besides some blood & a trail of Legos, near the body, and around the house. The case goes cold for 23 years, until another, even more brutal murder happens in Arizona.  These things seem to have no link, until you look a little closer at the Legos... An absolutely insane story!!</p>\n<p>Along the way, we find out red wine pairs nicely with Ring Dings, that helloing people may not be all it's cracked up to be, and when you need to murder someone, find a babysitter for your 4 kids!!</p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Hosted by James Pietragallo & Jimmie Whisman </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>New episodes every Thursday! </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Donate at: patreon.com/crimeinsports or go to paypal.com & use our email: crimeinsports@gmail.com </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Go to shutupandgivememurder.com for all things Small Town Murder & Crime In Sports! </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Follow us on... </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>twitter.com/@murdersmall </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>facebook.com/smalltownpod </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>instagram.com/smalltownmurder </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p>Also, check out James & Jimmie's other show, Crime In Sports!
