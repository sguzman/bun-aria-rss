  "description": "<p>On September 14, 1990, 10-year-old Kacey Perry was visiting with her father at his home in Portland, Oregon. That evening, the two had a disagreement during a conversation about Kacey coming to live with him full-time. Her father told Kacey to go to bed for the night, which he believed she had done. He went outside and chatted with a neighbor for a bit. When he returned, he found that Kacey was missing. Her father drove around the neighborhood but could not find Kacey. That is when he alerted the police that his daughter was missing, and the search began. No one could have guessed that more than 30 years later, they would still be searching for Kacey.</p><p>If you have any information about Kacey Perry's disappearance, please call the Portland Police Bureau at 503-823-0000.</p><p>This episode was sponsored by:</p><p><a href=\"http://thredup.com/Vanished\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">thredUP</a>- Get an extra 30% off your first order at&nbsp;<a href=\"http://thredup.com/VANISHED\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">thredUP.com/VANISHED</a>.</p><p>Listen ad-free with Wondery+.
