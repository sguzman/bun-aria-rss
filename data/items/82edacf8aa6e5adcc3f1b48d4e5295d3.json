  "description": "<p>With near-permanent dark circles under our eyes and a perfected diaper changing routine, it's easy to get lost in the haze of the baby stage. Instead of savoring the moment and seeing the opportunities, we rush through, wondering when the \"real\" parenting is going to start. But God didn't design children with a switch that flips at a certain age, but instead, he begins using mothers to do important gospel-work from the very beginning. In this episode, Emily and Laura discuss the important foundations laid for future discipleship during infancy. They also share lots of practical ideas for moms, caregivers, nursery workers, and anyone who wants to be intentional with the moments they share with a sweet little one. God cares for children, and he created babies to retain more than we think.</p> <p>Like what you hear?

You'll also find more encouragement and truth on how to be an intentional mother that cares for and loves her children with eternity in mind.
