  "description": "What did Mario Cuomo accomplish and set in motion during his three terms as New York governor? On The Gist, we examine a fascinating figure in American politics through the lens of a single Time Magazine luncheon from 1992. Slate’s Jacob Weisberg and NPR’s Adam Davidson explain how Cuomo's policies hold up all these years later. Weisberg profiled the liberal icon in a 1994 article for New York Magazine, “Remembering Mario Cuomo’s First 4,000 Days in Office.” For the Spiel, the price of a barrel of oil.\n\nAt the very end of this show, we debut a new They Might Be Giants song, as part of their Dial-a-Song reboot, as we will be doing every Monday this year. You can find videos for the song on the band’s website.\n\nGet The Gist by email as soon as it’s available: slate.com/GistEmail\n\nSubscribe to the podcast in iTunes: itunes.apple.com/us/podcast/slate…id873667927?mt=2\nLearn more about your ad choices.
