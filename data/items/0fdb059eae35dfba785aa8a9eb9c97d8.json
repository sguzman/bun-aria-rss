  "description": "<p class=\"\">Meredith and Kaytee are back from their short break between seasons to bring your more of the bookish goodness you’ve come to love. As well as some new fun stuff!</p> <p class=\"\">First and foremost, we’ve got a new Bookshelf Thomasville coupon code for you: CURRENTLYLOVING will get you 10% off from our friends over there through the month of August! Enjoy, and be looking for a fantastic giveaway from them for our listeners this month as well.</p> <p class=\"\">We’re also shouting out the first three women who couldn’t wait for us to officially roll out our <a href= \"http://patreon.com/currentlyreadingpodcast\" target=\"_blank\" rel= \"noopener\">Patreon</a> account before they went and became our Bookish Friends! Thanks, ladies!</p> <p class=\"\">You’ll hear a “bookish moment of the week” from each host: big kids cracking each other up while reading together, and giving book recommendations to a friend!</p> <p class=\"\">Next, we discuss our current reads for the week. We’ve both got a large docket of titles to choose from after our break, so we had a hard time narrowing it down!</p> <p class=\"\">You’ll notice a short new segment: Slow but Steady. Be sure to look for a post this weekend in which we ask you to chime in with your own Slow But Steady reads! If you’ve been looking at a book on your shelves for a long time, but you don’t want to commit to it as your “main” read, this is going to be JUST the segment for you. Let us know what you think!</p> <p class=\"\">For our deep dive, we are reflecting on what our break was like for both of us. Was our reading different? What did we do to keep ourselves busy? Are we glad we took a break? Listen in for the answers!</p> <p class=\"\">This week, we finish up with our first Belly Up to the Book Bar request from Sara Kilpatrick. Sara sent us a great list of titles, some of which pressed us out of our comfort zones. We can’t wait to hear what you think of our suggestions, or if you have more to add to Sara’s TBR pile!
