  "description": "It is a great tragedy that the Notre Dame cathedral burned yesterday. But what is it about that church, and those like it, that we find so awe inspiring? And why don’t we build churches of that sort anymore? Today I want to talk about the need for beauty in the church, and why we should start building beautiful churches again. Also, I’m going to defend someone I don’t usually defend. And I’ll answer your emails, including one about the rapture. Date: 04-16-2019\nLearn more about your ad choices.
