  "description": "Technocracy is the idea that experts should govern. For the common good, presumably.

In fact, it's an idea as old as politics itself.\nThis episode is the first in a three-part series telling stories of technocracies past, present, and future. First, Gordon takes us through the story of Technocracy, Inc. - the 1930s movement that wanted to install a non-democratic “technate” in North America. And then, you’ll hear a wide-ranging conversation on intellectuals and expertise with perhaps the most influential intellectual of our time: Noam Chomsky.\nSUPPORT THE SHOW\nYou can support the show for free by following or subscribing on Spotify, Apple Podcasts, or whichever app you use.
