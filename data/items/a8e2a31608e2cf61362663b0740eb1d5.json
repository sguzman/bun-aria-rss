  "description": "On Tuesday's Mark Levin Show, there is no indication that there will be any serious focus on international affairs or national security at the first presidential debate with President Trump and Joe Biden. Instead, there will be a focus on racism, the coronavirus, the Supreme Court, and mail-in voting, according to Axios. Later, Vice President Mike Pence joins the show to warn Americans of how important and decisive it was for Trump to have suspended travel from China. Pence also reiterated how big of an achievement it was for the United States to be roughly a month away from having the first coronavirus vaccine in the world. The media is dangerous and has celebrated and encouraged the disassembly of America. The Democrats say they love Justice Ginsburg but they refuse to listen to her. Even Ginsburg was against packing the Court for partisan purposes. Additionally, Rep. Matt Gaetz has called on the Florida Attorney General to look into Mike Bloomberg paying off $20 Million in back fines so that convicted felons can regain their voting rights. This comes on the heels of Florida Governor Ron DeSantis winning a decisive court case keeping felons off of the voter rolls. Also, Sen. Tom Cotton calls in to discuss Joe Biden and China. Finally, Candace Owens calls in to discuss her new book, Blackout: How Black America Can Make Its Second Escape from the Democrat Plantation, and why Joe Biden is not entitled to the votes of Black Americans.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
