  "description": "<p><p>Round 1: A Marine General drinks his own kool-aid and now looks like a big ole asshole in front of god and everybody. If you don't listen to this one, we'll castrate you. </p><p>Round 2: An Army Sergeant First Class blows me away with his dedication to command climate. This is a lesson all active duty folks need to take to heart and it doesn't involve weapons safety. </p><p>Round 3: Interview with Astronaut Scott Kelly. He's been to infinity and beyond. NBD</p><p>Round 4: A Navy base has been playing the national anthem on the emergency broadcast system every morning. People from 5 miles away can hear it in their living rooms. Lock your bodies if you can hear it. </p><p>Round 5: The newest Medal of Honor Recipient is not only getting the nation's highest award for valor, he's also getting 15 years of backpay. How much? You'll have to listen until the end wont you, you nasty little worm???</p><p>Â </p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
