  "description": "<p>In this hour of The Herd with Colin Cowherd, it's pretty clear by Week 16 who is a legitimate contender for an NFL title and who is trying to fool us. After getting healthy, the Dallas Cowboys wrecked the Washington Football Team and showed Colin that they are indeed legitimate. Also, after the Bills' win in New England, Colin sees quarterback play as the major difference between Buffalo and the Patriots. Plus, after seeing the Packers hold on to defeat the Browns, Colin likens Green Bay to the boxer who wins on points. The Packers are pretty and make plenty of contact, but they lack a knockout punch. Finally, former NFL quarterback and FOX Sports NFL analyst Michael Vick joins The Herd to offer his reaction to the weekend's gridiron results. </p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
