  "description": "<p>At the end of every year, people find excuses for why they didn't do what they PROMISED themselves they were going to do. But then they say sh*t like, \"2016 was practice.  2017 was a warm-up.  Now 2018 is game time!\" Seriously? What a joke. They aren't going to make a change. They aren't really going to accomplish anything. And neither are you...but it's probably not because you're lazy. It's something else. In this episode, I tell you what it is--and how, if you really want to crush the new year, you can. </p>",
