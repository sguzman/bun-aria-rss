We've got a great show for you!\n\n-InVets.org/Zero to make a profile to help find a good job after the military and get a free shirt.\n\nROUND 1: “If you could say one thing to your recruiter what would it be?” - that’s the question one soldier posed to his buddies in a viral social media post, and POG civilians are in a TIZZY over their answers\n\nROUND 2: Out with the mold, in with the new? The U.S. Army plans to spend nearly $10 billion repairing its barracks over the next decade, and we have just the man for the job - Long Time Toolie… me! \n\nROUND 3: Grab your top secret clearances, we’re taking you deep under the ice of Greenland to tell you about Project Iceworm which are frozen nuke tunnels that are heating things up during the Cold War\n\nROUND 4: In the criminal justice system, postal- based offenses are considered especially heinous. In Pittsburgh, the dedicated detectives who investigate these vicious felonies are members of an elite squad known as the Special Postal Unit DUN DUN\n\nROUND 5: Ah, the police-call - long lines of troops hunched over, endlessly searching for something mundane in the grass… We asked you, ‘What are the stupidest things your unit ever had to look for?” You can sit this round out if you were in 2-9!</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
