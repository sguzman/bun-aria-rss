  "description": "A short supplemental on one of the inspirations for Merlin, a man named Myrddin the Wyllt,  a Welsh warrior bard who went insane after seeing his friends die on the battlefield and ran off to a life in the forest. It would have been fine if people didn't keep dragging him back to civilization...or if he had thought at all about what he would do during the winter. You'll see that \"insane\" in this story is kind of a loose term for \"I just want a little 'me' time in the forest.\"<br>On the creature of the week, you'll meet that thing that yells all night in your kitchen and shatters all your good plates, and I'll guess at what she's doing with all that evil linen thread she's spinning.<p><a href=\"https://www.mythpodcast.com/membership\" rel=\"payment\">Support the show: https://www.mythpodcast.com/membership</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
