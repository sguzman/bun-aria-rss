  "description": "As websites and apps more widely adopt TLS (Transport Layer Security) and communicate over HTTPS connections, unencrypted traffic may draw even more attention, since it’s easier for analysts and security tools to identify malicious communication patterns in those plain HTTP sessions. Malware authors know this, and they’ve made it a priority to adopt TLS and thereby obfuscate the contents of malicious communication.\nJoining us on this week's Research Saturday is Chester Wisniewski from SophosLabs discussing their research on the subject. \nThe research can be found here:\n Nearly a quarter of malware now communicates using TLS",
