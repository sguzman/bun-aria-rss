  "title": "Nathan Robinson’s case for socialism",
  "description": "“Socialism” is simultaneously one of the most commonly used and most confusing terms in American politics. Does being a socialist mean advocating for the complete abolition of capitalism, markets, and private property? Does it mean supporting a higher tax rate, Medicare-for-all, and Sen. Bernie Sanders? Or does it simply mean a deep hatred of systemic injustice and the institutions that perpetuate it? \nIn his new book Why You Should be a Socialist Nathan J Robinson, the founder and editor-in-chief of the Current Affairs magazine, attempts to shed light on these questions. In his writing, Robinson distinguishes between a “socialist economy” (think collective ownership, worker cooperatives, single-payer health care) and what he calls a “socialist ethic\": a deep sense of moral outrage that animates agents of radical change. This distinction may sound like a dodge, but I think Robinson gets at something here that — while hard to understand from the outside — is crucial to understanding today's left politics. We also discuss: \n- The central role of democracy to the socialist worldview\n- What it means to be a “libertarian socialist”\n- What Robinson's socialist utopia would look like \n- Why so many socialists have turned on Sen. Elizabeth Warren in favor of Sen. Bernie Sanders \n- Robinson’s special loathing for South Bend, Indiana, Mayor Pete Buttigieg\n- What he believes Sanders’s “political revolution” would look like\n- The lessons of Jeremy Corbyn\n- Whether the deep difference between liberals and socialists is temperament \n- Why “public vs. private” is often a false choice\n- The challenge of economic growth \nAnd much more. \nBook recommendations: \nUnderstanding Power by Noam Chomsky\nThe Anarchist FAQ by Ian McKay \nThe Dispossessed by Ursula K. Le Guin\n If you enjoyed this episode, you may also like:\nLeftists vs. Liberals with Elizabeth Bruenig \nMatt Bruenig’s case for single-payer health care\nWhy my politics are bad with Bhaskar Sunkara\n\nNew to the show?
