Thanks for my friend Prof. Yossi Keshet for organizing and inviting me!<br />One notable talk which is unfortunately missing from the videos is of Prof. Adi Shamir described in <a href=\"https://arxiv.org/abs/1901.10861\">this paper</a>. The work analysis how many pixels one should change to confuse a deep learning based classifier. The result is surprising - only a few! A related describe work is <a href=\"https://www.sciencemag.org/news/2018/07/turtle-or-rifle-hackers-easily-fool-ais-seeing-wrong-thing?r3f_986=https://www.google.com/\">this</a>.",
