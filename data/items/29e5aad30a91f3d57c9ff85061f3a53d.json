MLB Commissioner Rob Manfred has already suspended the Houston Astros’ Jeff Luhnow and A.J. Hinch -- both were subsequently fired by the team. Additionally, the Red Sox have fired manager Alex Cora, who previously worked for the Astros. The league is still investigating allegations made against the Red Sox. Also talked about is the WNBA’s new labor contract, which significantly increases player salaries and benefits. For the first time the league’s average salary will eclipse $100,000. Also discussed is a recap of the college football championship game, including LSU quarterback Joe Burrow clinging to the game ball, which one memorabilia expert said is worth at least $100,000.
