  "description": "Biden's unconstitutional pandering to the Democrat base on student loan forgiveness wouldn't pass Congress, so he's using the covid \"emergency\" to implement it by executive order. Buck says, \"To me, it's just the Democrats doing what they always do, which is taking care of their base and trying to find ways to shift money to the interests that vote for them.\" KJP spars with Peter Doocy on student loan forgiveness cost. Clay says, \"Why don't we ask the schools to refund some of the loan costs, right? I mean, why don't we tax their endowments at an insanely high rate?\" Novak Djokovic out of U.S. Open because of idiotic covid rules. Listener Joe, who famously confronted Elizabeth Warren on student loan forgiveness on the campaign trail in 2020, calls Clay and Buck to tell us how that moment happened.<p><a href=\"https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck\" rel=\"payment\">Follow Clay & Buck on YouTube: https://www.youtube.com/c/clayandbuck</a></p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
