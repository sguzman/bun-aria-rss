  "description": "<p>When employees are paid more, they give more. Going above market pay might sound like a fantasy, but in a growing number of companies it’s becoming a profitable reality. Peek inside workplaces that have reinvented their pay structures to give employees their worth and more—and explore the science of how it can pay off for everyone in the long run. Note: This episode was published in May 2021, and features an employee at Gravity Payments, whose founder and longtime CEO has stepped down in light of serious allegations of sexual misconduct.  The behavior reported by the New York Times is completely unacceptable and not condoned by TED or any parties that contributed to the episode. Our focus in this episode is not on Dan Price, but on what can be learned from an experiment at the company on raising pay.
