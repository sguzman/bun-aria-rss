  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat and the boys chat about AJ still being at the Ryder Cup to represent Team USA in the celebrity portion, and why the USA needs to put Bryson and Brooks together for the 4-ball competition to get the US out of the gates early. They also cover tonight's Thursday Night Football game between the Panthers and Texans, and Pat concocts a juicy 4 leg risk free parlay that is now live and available on FanDuel after you opt-in. Joining the program for the first time is Super Bowl Champion, 13th overall pick of the 2020 NFL Draft, Iowa Hawkeye legend and RT for the Tampa Bay Buccaneers, Tristan Wirfs. Pat and Tristan chat about what it's like being in the huddle with Tom Brady, how he would characterize his play style, what you need to focus on before going into a game when a guy like Aaron Donald is on the other side, and how much of a culture shock it was going from Iowa to Tampa (25:28-34:23). Next, joining the program for his weekly Wrap-Up is NFL Network Insider, Ian Rapoport. Pat and Ian chat about Carson Wentz' sprained ankles, how serious Tua's rib injury is, when we can expect to see Jamie Collins wearing a Patriots uniform again this season, his thoughts for tonight's Thursday Night Football game, and what he need to know going into week 3 of the NFL season (43:47-1:09:40). Later, a man who coached in the NFL for 20+ years, most notably as the Offensive Coordinator for the Pittsburgh Steelers and Head Coach for the Kansas City Chiefs, Todd Haley joins the show to chat about his career as a coach in the NFL, his thoughts on Urban Meyer and why he doesn't think he'll just pack up and leave, what his relationships with Ben Roethlisberger and Mike Tomlin were like, how much the game has changed since he's been out of the league, how much he's enjoying coaching high school football, and much more (1:11:51-1:38:48).
