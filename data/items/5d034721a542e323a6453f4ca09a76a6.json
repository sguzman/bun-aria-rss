  "description": "<p><span>Hear so-called “indie classical” works on this New Sounds - music which is at home in both the contemporary classical music world and the indie rock/pop music halls, basements, and dive bars. Listen to the “NYC garage-chamber septet” The Cellar and Point, who use acoustic instruments and electronics to create a sound that is winningly melodic, thoughtful in its balance, groove-heavy, sometimes glitchy, and delightfully unpredictable as the septet straddles all kinds of genres. </span><span>Members of the group also currently perform with JACK Quartet, Mivos Quartet, Ensemble Signal, and Mantra Percussion.  </span></p> <p>There’s also music involving string trio, flute, clarinet, and trumpet by members of yMusic in many different configurations; from the first record, \"Beautiful Mechanical,\" in music by Sarah Kirkland Snider; and a new work by Marcos Balter from their latest, \"Balance Problems\" (due out 9/30.)  Then, hear new music from My Brightest Diamond, led by the enigmatic composer and vocalist Shara Worden. It's another of her engaging, soaring symphonic pop creations, in a remix by Son Lux, featuring the acrobatic and unbelievable saxophonist Colin Stetson. Plus, listen to music by Sufjan Stevens, the multi-instrumentalist/producer/co-founder of the record label Asthmatic Kitty, from his film and music project, “The BQE,” and more.   </p>\n<p>PROGRAM #3637, Indie Classical (First aired on 9/16/2014)  </p>\n<table width=\"95%\" border=\"1\" cellpadding=\"0\" cellspacing=\"0\">\n<tbody>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>ARTIST(S)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>RECORDING</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>CUT(S)</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>SOURCE</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>Sufjan Stevens &amp; the BQE Project</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>The Brooklyn-Queens Expressway</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Sufjan Stevens: The BQE, Movement III Linear Tableau with Intersecting Surprise [4:27]</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Asthmatic Kitty 278 <br><a href=\"http://www.asthmatickitty.com/\">www.asthmatickitty.com</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>yMusic</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Balance Problems</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Balter: Bladed Stance [5:46]</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p><a href=\"http://newamrecords.com/ymusic-balance-problems\" target=\"_blank\">newamrecords.com</a><br>Due out September 30, 2014</p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>The Cellar and Point</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Ambit</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Arc [6:04]</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Cuneiform Records RUNE 376<br>Due out October 14, 2014<br><a href=\"http://www.cuneiformrecords.com/\">cuneiformrecords.com</a></p>\n</td>\n</tr>\n<tr>\n<td>\n<p>My Brightest Diamond</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>None More Than You EP</p>\n</td>\n<td>\n<p>Dreaming Awake (Son Lux mix feat.
