  "description": "<p>Are you an entrepreneur or a manager, and you feel like every day at work you're just putting out fires? Or in your personal life, you go home and it's just crisis after crisis that needs fixing. And so you try to manage this trouble-shooting by getting more efficient at putting out those fires.

On the show we talk about his book, Work the System, and how everyone can benefit from systemizing their work and life.</p>\n",
