  "description": "<p>Even with the best intentions, we're all prone to distraction and busyness, tempting us away from time with the Lord. In 2017, it's the heartbeat of Risen Motherhood to not only discuss how to apply the gospel to everyday situations, but to encourage moms to spend more time learning the word of God. In this episode, Emily and Laura give some personal updates and set the course for another year of new podcast episodes. We're so grateful for your support, and look forward to walking this journey together in an amazing community of moms who long to glorify God!</p> <p> Like what you hear?

Find us on Instagram, Facebook and Twitter (@risenmotherhood) to find more encouragement and truth on how to be an intentional mother that cares for and loves her children with eternity in mind.
