  "description": "Daniel Kaluuya doesn't want to stop the journey. Getting nominated for Oscars, winning a Golden Globe, hosting Saturday Night Live. These are moments within the journey, but he doesn't want any of them to feel bigger than the journey itself. Daniel and Marc talk about this life perspective, how he draws a lot of it from his family in London and Uganda, and how he incorporated it into his portrayal of Black Panther Chairman Fred Hampton in Judas and the Black Messiah. They also talk about Sicario, Get Out and his improv days. <p>Sign up here for WTF+ to get the full show archives and weekly bonus material!  <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast\">https://plus.acast.com/s/wtf-with-marc-maron-podcast</a>.</p>\n\n<br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
