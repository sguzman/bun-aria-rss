In her role at Public Integrity, Torres leads one of the few all-Latino investigative teams in the country.

She&nbsp; co-founded the Florida Center for Investigative Reporting and was the first Latina elected to the board of directors of the Investigative Reporters and Editors and the Florida Society of News Editors. Torres’ success spotlights the Center for Public Integrity’s transformation to report on inequality and our commitment to diverse voices in investigative journalism.</p>\n\n\n\n<p>The event will be broadcast live from this webpage as well as from Public Integrity’s <a href=\"https://www.facebook.com/publici\">Facebook page</a>.
