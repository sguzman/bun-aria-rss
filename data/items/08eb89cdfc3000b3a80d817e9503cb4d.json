He was on base and was doing a training mission and saw two creatures watching his group. He said that he saw a creature in a push up position watching him. He heard crashing in the brush and the one creature was joined by another creature. Anthony also shares other encounters he has personally had along with some strange encounters that he has looked into. </p>",
