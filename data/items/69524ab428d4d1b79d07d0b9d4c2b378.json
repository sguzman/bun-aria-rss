  "description": "<p>The extraordinarily bright gamma-ray burst GRB 221009A was observed by a\nlarge number of observatories, from radio frequencies to gamma-rays. Of\nparticular interest are the reported observations of photon-like air showers of\nvery high energy: an 18 TeV event in LHAASO and a 251 TeV event at Carpet-2.\nGamma rays at these energies are expected to be absorbed by pair-production\nevents on background photons when travelling intergalactic distances. Several\nworks have sought to explain the observations of these events, assuming they\noriginate from GRB 221009A, by invoking axion-like particles (ALPs). We\nreconsider this scenario and account for astrophysical uncertainties due to\npoorly known magnetic fields and background photon densities. We find that,\nrobustly, the ALP scenario cannot simultaneously account for an 18 TeV and a\n251 TeV photon from GRB 221009A.\n</p>",
