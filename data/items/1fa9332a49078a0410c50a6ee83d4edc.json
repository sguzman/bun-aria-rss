  "description": "<p>Our mental state has so much to do with how we handle our money- this is one of the many things we talked about with Paco de Leon. Paco founded The Hell Yeah Group which is a financial firm focused on inspiring creatives to engage with their personal and business finances. She started this work after her experiences in small business consulting, financial planning, and wealth management. Paco’s work has been featured in The New York Times, Forbes, and NPR and her new book “Finance for the People” was published earlier this month. Not only is she the author, but Paco is also the illustrator- her drawings do a fantastic job driving home the different points she makes in her book so we’re recommending it for all the visual learners out there. During this episode we talk about what Paco learned from being a debt collector and her time in the marijuana industry, what it takes to be a creative freelancer, the role our emotions play, how she keeps her consumption in check, and plenty more!</p><p><br></p><p>During this episode we enjoyed a Lager Hell Rugenbrau- a big thanks to Julia for donating these delicious beers to the show!
