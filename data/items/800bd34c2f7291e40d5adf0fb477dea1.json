  "description": "<p>On this retrospective episode of Battles & Banter, Avery, Codie and Tony take a look back on their personal experiences and thoughts from the day of September 11, 2001. On that tragic day, over 3,000 people lost their lives due to the heinous terrorist attacks inspired by Osama Bin Laden. Two planes flew into the twin towers of the World Trade Center, one plane hit the Pentagon, and a final plane went down in the quiet fields outside of Shanksville, Pennsylvania. The country and the world changed that day, and the last two decades of war came to a somber end for the United States and its Afghan allies this past August. The guys reflect on 9/11 from their personal memories of that day and the following weeks, months, years that shaped the world we now live in today. Released on the 20th anniversary, this episode is a retrospective commemoration to a world event that has impacted our lives and our society since. So strap in and join your the B&B fellas as they take a look back on the day the world never forgot.</p>",
