  "description": "<p>After months of mostly quiet, behind-the-scenes debate, both the House and Senate seem ready to move forward with reforming the Electoral Count Act, the 1887 statute governing how Congress counts electoral votes, whose various ambiguities played a central role in unsuccessful plans to turn the 2020 election results in favor of former President Trump.

But the path forward remains far from certain.&nbsp;</p><p>To discuss what comes next, <em>Lawfare</em> senior editor Scott R. Anderson sat down with Ned Foley, a leading election law expert and professor at The Ohio State University's Moritz College of Law, and Genevieve Nadeau, a Counsel at the organization Protect Democracy who has been engaging on reform efforts. They discussed the similarities and differences between the House and Senate reform proposals, how they will strengthen our election process, and what work remains to be done.&nbsp;</p><p>Support this show <a target=\"_blank\" rel=\"payment\" href=\"http://supporter.acast.com/lawfare\">http://supporter.acast.com/lawfare</a>.</p><br /><hr><p style='color:grey; font-size:0.75em;'> Hosted on Acast.
