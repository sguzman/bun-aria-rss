  "title": "Crushing It by Gary Vaynerchuck",
  "description": "This book is a follow up to Gary's bestseller 'Crush It' released in 2009, which defined how everyone can cash in on their passion. 'Crushing It' is an update to that book including testimonials from people who had successfully implemented principles in 'Crush It', to build successful businesses. Gary includes what he believes to be the eight essentials in developing a company that can influence. Examples of the eight include intent, attention and the most important... content. Like 'Crush It' this book looks forward to the future and the tools businesses can use to grow and gain attention. The most significant device being voice recognition using Alexa voice. This book brings a lot of practical value for anyone wanting to build a sustainable business by leveraging social media to their advantage. I would suggest readers begin with his previous book 'Crush It' before moving onto this book. That being said, it's still a great read on its own. Five stars.\n\nOMBR\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
