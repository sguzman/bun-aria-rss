Plus, the Texas Senate committee on the Uvalde shooting convenes, as the US House of Representatives January 6th commission continues. And in the Spiel, a misleading CNN report purports to find massive racial disparities in hundreds of heat-related deaths, but the numbers just aren’t there.\nProduced by Joel Patterson and Corey Wara\nEmail us at thegist@mikepesca.com\nTo advertise on the show, visit: https://advertisecast.com/TheGist\nLearn more about your ad choices.
