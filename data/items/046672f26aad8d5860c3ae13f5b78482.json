Over the past year Matt has grown a serious audience on YouTube, he’s about to cross 1 million subscribers, and some of his videos have hit the 7 million view mark. The interesting thing about Matt is that he’s made YouTube a career for himself without any advertising or sponsorships. He’s paved his own way to make filmmaking a career. On this episode we talk to Matt about why he doesn't do advertising and how he supports his filmmaking career.",
