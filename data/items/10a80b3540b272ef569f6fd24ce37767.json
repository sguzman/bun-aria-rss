  "title": "Virtual Reality as Immersive Enclosure, with Paul Roquet (EF, JP)",
  "description": "Paul Roquet is an MIT associate professor in media studies and Japan studies; his earlier work includes Ambient Media. It was his recent mind-bending The Immersive Enclosure that prompted John and Elizabeth to invite him to discuss the history of \"head-mounted media\" and the perceptual implications of virtual reality.\nPaul Elizabeth and John discuss the appeal of leaving actuality aside and how the desire to shut off immediate surroundings shapes VR's rollout in Japan. The discussion covers perceptual scale-change as part of VR's appeal--is that true of earlier artwork as well? They explore moral panic in Japan and America, recap the history of early VR headset adapters on trains and compare various Japanese words for \"virtual\" and their antonyms. Paul wonders if the ephemerality of the views glimpsed in a rock garden served as guiding paradigm for how VR is experienced.\nMentioned in the episode\n\nYoshikazu Nango, \"A new form of 'solitary space'....\" (2021)\n\n\nHaruki Murakami's detailed fictional worlds of the 1980's onwards: real-feeling yet not actual history.\n\nWalter Scott's Waverley novels: can we also understand the novel as an immersive machine that leaves readers half in their actual world?\n\nLewis Carrol's Alice's Adventures in Wonderland (1865), with its interplay between enclosure and expansion, and its shrinking/expanding motif)\n\nIan Bogost on e-readers\n\n\nC S Lewis's wardrobe as portal in The Lion the Witch and the Wardrobe (1950)\n\nLukacs focuses on the dizzying and transformative scale in Naturalism in \"Narrate or Describe?\" (1936)\n\nWearable heart monitors as feedback machines for watching scary movies.\n\nThe pre-history of Pokemon Go is various games played by early users of VR headsets on trains.\n\n\nSword Art Online is a breakout popular example of Japanese stories of players trapped inside a game-world\n\nThomas Boellstroff, Coming of Age in Second Life\n\n\nWe Met in Virtual Reality\n\nNeil Stephenson's Snow Crash (1992) coined the concept of the metaverse.\n\n\nRecallable Books\n\nMadeline L'Engle The Wind in the Door (1973).\n\n\nCervantes, Don Quixote (1606/1615)\n\nFutari Okajima Klein Bottle (1989)\n\nCollections such as Immersed in Technology, Future Visions, Virtual Realities and their Discontents; also, other early VR criticism of the 1990s including early feminist critique, scattered across journals in the early to mid 1990s .
