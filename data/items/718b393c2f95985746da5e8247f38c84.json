  "description": "Legislation targeting transgender Americans and trans children has increased sharply in the last year.  Guest host Ari Shapiro speaks with the Florida mother of a trans daughter about how their family is coping with that state's new, more  restrictive policies.  Then, Ari discusses how this wave of law-making differs from so-called \"moral panics\" of past decades — and why that matters — with historian Jules Gill-Peterson, of Johns Hopkins University.<br/><br/>Then, Broadway is back and bigger than ever, with 16 new shows opening this month.  But this Broadway burst hasn't been immune to the pandemic. \"Macbeth\" director Sam Gold talks to Ari about having to go onstage himself this month, when too many of his cast tested positive for Covid; and about what feels different as actors and audiences try to get back to normal.  <br/><br/><em>You can follow us on Twitter </em><a href=\"https://twitter.com/NPRItsBeenAMin\"><em>@NPRItsBeenAMin</em></a><em> and email us at </em><a href=\"mailto:ibam@npr.org\"><em>ibam@npr.org</em></a><em>.</em> ",
