  "description": "<p>In part two of The Price Tag of Leadership Series, John walks through the final two truths about self-discipline that explain what makes it the biggest gamechanger in leadership. He reminds us that “Everything worthwhile is uphill––all the way.” But success doesn’t come just by climbing. It’s also dependent on consistency, which is why John warns us in this episode about coasting.</p> <p>Mark Cole and Richard Chancy elaborate on John’s idea that self-discipline is most easily developed in your strengths and passions. They point out that passion is not simply enthusiasm or drive. Instead, it’s what keeps you up at night. As John would say, your passion is the thing that you sing about, cry about, and dream about. The questions is: Are you willing to pay the price to attain it?</p> <p>Our BONUS resource for this series is The Price Tag of Leadership Worksheet, which includes fill-in-the-blank notes from John’s teaching. You can download the worksheet by visiting MaxwellPodcast.com/PriceTag and clicking “Download the Bonus Resource.”</p> <p>This series comes from a portion of John’s Developing the Leader Within You online course.
