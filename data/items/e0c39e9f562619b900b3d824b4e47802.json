  "description": "<p>If you're still with me at this point, my guess is that you've decided it's time to start a business. Congratulations, you've done it! While it's certainly an important step in the process, it's merely the first domino to fall. In today's episode, I'm here to explain the benefits and pitfalls of all of the various types of business opportunities that could be available to you. Whether it's selling farm products, running an online business, network marketing, dropshipping, and everything in between, the same basic principles still apply. No matter what, you need to know what you're selling, who you're selling to, and how you are going to let people know about your business. As long as you know what sets you apart and makes you better, it doesn't matter how competitive the space. Even if you aren't planning on starting a business at this point, I know you'll pull some incredible information out of this entire season.<br/><br/></p><ul><li>Save $15 when you snag a reCAP Mason Jars lid kit and put your mason jar collection to work!
