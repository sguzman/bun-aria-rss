  "description": "<p>r/AmITheA**hole In today's episode, OP discovers that his mother committed identity fraud and secretly took out a massive loan in his name. By the time he found out about it, the loan amount had grown to a massive $43,000! His mother hadn't been making any payments on it, so it just kept accruing interest and fees. Once OP finds out about it, his mom actually expects him to just suck it up and pay off the loan by himself as a favor to her. OP is thinking about reporting his mom to the authorities for effectively stealing from him. Would that make him the butthole?</p>\n",
