  "description": "<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Whether we’re brand new moms or have decades of experience in motherhood, we’ve likely all come upon a moment or season when it’s hard to find true joy. When the calendar is filled to the brim with sports practices, our teen makes a cutting remark at the dinner table, another night’s sleep is interrupted, or motherhood just isn’t as picture-perfect as we always imagined, we need a well of joy that never runs dry. In this episode, Laura reads a collection of verses to meditate on as we seek true joy in motherhood. As these truths root deep into our hearts, we’ll see that looking to and thinking about the Lord, his work, and his promises can give us deep joy, even if we still experience grief and pain. We pray these verses bring an eternal hope as you look to him for joy in every season.</span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"><em>Note: We understand that the absence of joyful or hopeful feelings can have a wide variety of factors and causes. <strong>Please keep in mind that some instances of persistent sadness or depression may require professional counseling, pastoral care, or a medical doctor.</strong> If you find yourself in a situation that feels much larger than the topics we cover in this series, we encourage you to seek help from professionals who are trained to care for you best in this struggle.</em></span></p> <p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Scripture quotations are from the ESV® Bible (The Holy Bible, English Standard Version®), Copyright © 2001 by Crossway, a publishing ministry of Good News Publishers.
