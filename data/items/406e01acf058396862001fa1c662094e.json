  "description": "A faultfinder is defined as “a person given to harsh judgments and to finding faults.” None of us want to wear that label, and none of us want to be around a faultfinder. But it’s so easy to see what’s wrong in a situation and what could be done better. It’s so easy to see what’s wrong with another person and how they could change for the better. Our natural minds tend to always gravitate to the negative, and it causes us to find fault.You can’t stop all the negative thoughts you have about people and situations, but you can stop giving those thoughts life by speaking them out.  Don’t give it life! Don’t ruin relationships and situations! You’re never going to see the change you want by finding fault.So what should you do? God says, “Rejoice always, pray continually, give thanks in all circumstances; for this is God’s will for you in Christ Jesus” (1 Thessalonians 5:16–18 NIV). Let’s not be faultfinders. Let’s be those who pray and petition God for change with thanksgiving in our heart.<p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
