  "description": "As children we are given many cautionary phrases to ensure our safety. \"Don't talk to strangers. Always lock the door. Never travel alone. Be home before dark.\" As well meaning and sound as those warnings are, like with the characters in today's stories, within each of us is the need to answer that burning question...\"Why not?\" First, we're told never to respond when called at night. Next, we're instructed to never crash a house party. After that, we're told to take the long way and never take the shortcut. And finally, we're begged to never respond to the voices that whisper to us.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit podcastchoices.com/adchoices",
