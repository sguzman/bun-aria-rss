    "media:description": "Texas is considering constructing a $26.2 billion seawall south of Houston. Houston, the fourth most populous city in the USA, hosts the largest petrochemical complex in the country. It refines 27% of the nation’s gasoline and 60% of its aviation fuel. However, this complex is threatened by hurricanes and the storm surges they bring. If a hurricane directly hit the complex, it would result in an estimated $100 billion in damage. To help prevent this, professor William Merrill and the US Army Corps of Engineers have proposed a massive, 58 mile long seawall along the southern coast of Houston, nicknamed Ike Dike. The proposed seawall would protect national security and prevent a wildlife disaster. However, it would also be extremely expensive, could lower property values and disrupt local fish and oyster populations. As of 2021, the proposal is gaining momentum and is planned to be presented to Congress soon.\n\nIf you enjoyed this video, please consider subscribing for more great content in the future!\n\nThank you to the following sources!\n\nInformation\nhttps://www.texasmonthly.com/news-politics/build-ike-dike/\nhttps://today.tamu.edu/2021/06/02/texas-am-prof-passage-of-ike-dike-bill-a-great-start/\nhttps://today.tamu.edu/2020/08/24/texas-am-expert-ike-dike-still-needed-to-protect-galveston-area/\nhttps://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ike_Dike\nhttps://www.tamug.edu/ikedike/pdf/JSU-Final-Report-Ike-Dike-Concept.pdf\nhttps://www.houstonpublicmedia.org/articles/news/energy-environment/2020/10/30/385009/army-corps-unveils-updated-version-of-its-26-billion-project-to-protect-the-texas-gulf-coast-from-hurricanes-storm-surge/\nhttps://www.swg.usace.army.mil/Portals/26/docs/Planning/Public%20Notices-Civil%20Works/2020%20Coastal%20DIFR%20and%20dEIS/Coastal%20TX%20Executive%20Summary_20201019.pdf?ver=9fE_s4Hla4njYurhqiCYHQ%3D%3D\nhttps://www.swg.usace.army.mil/Portals/26/docs/Planning/Public%20Notices-Civil%20Works/2020%20Coastal%20DIFR%20and%20dEIS/CT_EIS_AppendixF_CMZA_2020%20Final%20DEIS.pdf?ver=NMIgHm-uC0U249krfVSFIw%3D%3D\nhttps://abc13.com/ike-dike-spine-hurricane-laura/6394450/\n\n\nAudio\nStoryblocks\n\nGraphics\nStoryblocks\nGoogle Earth\nLAUP TAMU\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=0xJjPFXTyOg\nThe Texas A&M University System\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=K2iqXkt7uOY\nHouston Northwest Chamber of Commerce\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=5csrJpBRo4c\nRijkswaterstaat\nhttps://www.youtube.com/watch?v=wetmgwicbXs",
