  "description": "Earnings season is underway… and after more than a decade, the results actually seem to matter to investors. Shares of Netflix (NFLX) are moving higher on strong earnings and huge insider buying. Daniel and I give our take on co-CEO Reed Hastings’ “perfect timing” in scooping up shares… and whether Netflix will be able to maintain its dominant position as competition in the streaming space heats up. [0:45] UPS (UPS) is also moving to the upside after reporting blowout numbers, despite seeing higher costs in the quarter. I explain why, despite the rise in its stock price, the company is still trading at a reasonable valuation. [10:00] Daniel takes a small victory lap as his  recommendation, ExxonMobil (XOM), trades near 52-week highs following earnings. (It’s up about 30% in the portfolio.) He breaks down how the push to “green energy” will actually drive oil higher… and ExxonMobil will continue to benefit. [14:00] Joe Rogan is sparking a heated debate over COVID “information” on Spotify, with artists pulling their music from the platform. I give my take on the drama… and whether Spotify (SPOT) is a buy at current levels given the negative press. [21:25] Turning to crypto, Meta Platforms (FB)—formerly Facebook—is ending its Diem stablecoin efforts… and selling the assets to  Silvergate Capital (SI). I highlight why I love this move by Meta… and Daniel shares why it’s great for Silvergate. [31:50]",
