  "description": "Leon Brenner's The Autistic Subject: On the Threshold of Language (Palgrave Macmillan, 2020) makes a forceful case for the relevance of Lacanian psychoanalysis in the understanding and treatment of autism. Refusing both cognitive and identitarian approaches to the topic, Brenner rigorously theorizes autism as a unique mode of subjectivity and relation to language that sits alongside the classical Freudian structures of psychosis, neurosis, and perversion. In this interview, Brenner dispels misconceptions around psychoanalysis \"blaming the mother,\" as we explore his conceptualisation of autistic subjectivity alongside clinical examples.\n Jordan Osserman is a postdoctoral research fellow and psychoanalyst in training in London.
