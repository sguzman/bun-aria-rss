Stan joins to talk about some of the trades he's made over the past few years and basically goes in depth on why he made each one. Stan also responds to some of the negativity he is receiving from Blackhawks fans, but first he opens up with what it was like growing up being the son of Scotty Bowman. The guys also touch on some NHL news around the league including the Tom Wilson hit, some beef Grinnelli got in, the William Nylander signing and much more.</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
