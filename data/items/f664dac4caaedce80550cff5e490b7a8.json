    "media:description": "There is a MathOverflow question with title \"Why aren't representations of monoids studied so much?''. Well, I do not know, but it can't be because the theory is bad. In fact, there is a well-developed theory that is about 80 years old, and this theory is almost as smooth and beautiful as group representation theory itself. \n\nThere are even categorifications of it: What categorifies monoids? For example monoidal categories. And indeed the representation theory of monoids categorifies to representation theory of monoidal categories.\n\nThis talk is a friendly overview of the representation theory of monoidal categories with no prior knowledge about this theory assumed.",
