  "description": "<p><strong>Janis Provisor </strong>and <strong>Brad Davis</strong> were established artists, displaying their work in museums and galleries across the world. Then a recession hit in the nineties, and they took a sabbatical in China, which led to an experiment with silk weaving, which, 25 years later, has led to an acclaimed luxury hand-knotted carpet company. In this episode of the <i>Business of Home</i> podcast, Provisor and Davis chat with host <strong>Dennis Scully</strong> about the ups and downs of doing business in China, why they needed to create their own brand, and treating entrepreneurship like an artistic challenge. <i>This episode is sponsored by Chairish and Google.</i></p>\n",
