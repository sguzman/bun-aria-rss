Subjects covered include:</p><br><p>* how my approach to training, racing and nutrition has evolved over the years;</p><p>* my approach to racing Ötillö (this was recorded prior to that event);</p><p>* good pain v. bad pain – i.e., distinguishing laziness from the need to rest;</p><p>* my role models & influences; and</p><p>* thoughts on meditation, spirituality & service.</p><br><p><br></p><p>In addition, I was asked how Julie and I work together as a team — balancing our similarities and differences.
