  "description": "<p><p>In Episode 48, the guys open things up talking about the incredibly moving pre-game ceremonies for Opening Night in Las Vegas. They also discuss the record-making fast start for the Golden Knights as well a few other teams that jumped out of the gate pretty quick. Whits gives some insight on what it's like for a player to get off to a hot start and the psychological effect it has. The guys also discuss teams that haven't gotten off to the start they wanted to. They finish things up with #AllRightHamilton and RA tells an outrageous prom story from four years after he graduated high school. Lotta laughs this week. Enjoy.</p></p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube. Prime Members can listen ad-free on Amazon Music.
