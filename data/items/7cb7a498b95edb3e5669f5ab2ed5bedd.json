  "description": "Breathing; A mindless activity we do each and every day without giving any effort, thought, or practice. Perhaps this is the reason why so many of us suffer from poor sleep, lack of energy, weakened immune systems, and slow metabolisms. On this episode of Impact Theory, journalist and author of “Breath: The New Science of a Lost Art” James Nestor joins Tom Bilyeu to discuss why you need to immediately reevaluate your entire approach to breathing.
