Her illness is preventing that, so she asks if she can borrow OP's baby for a few months so that she can experience the joys of motherhood before it's too late. When OP refuses, people get incredibly angry at her and call her selfish for not letting someone else raise her baby. Is OP the butthole in this situation?
