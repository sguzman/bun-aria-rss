She covers the economy, markets, investing and anything else with a dollar sign on TV, on the “Jill on Money” podcast, and on her nationally syndicated show, “Jill on Money.” Before stepping into the world of financial news and advice, she spent 14 years as the co-owner and Chief Investment Officer for an independent investment advisory firm, after following in her dad’s footsteps as a trader on the floor of the NY Commodities exchange.
