  "description": "I’ve been a fan of Tim Urban and his site Wait But Why for a long time. Urban uses whimsical illustrations, infographics, and friendly, nontechnical language to explain everything from AI to space exploration to the Fermi Paradox. \nUrban's most recent project is an explainer series called “The Story of Us.\" It began as an attempt to understand what is going on in American politics today, and quickly turned into a deep exploration into humanity's past: how we evolved, the history of civilization, and the way our psychologies have come to interact with the world around us. \nMy initial theory of this conversation was that Urban’s work has interesting points of convergence and divergence with my book. But once we got to talking, something more interesting emerged: Based on his reading of human history, psychology, and technological advancement, Urban has come to believe we are at an existential fork-in-the-road as a species. A hundred years from now, Urban thinks, our species will either advance so significantly that we will no longer be recognizable as human beings, or we will so lose control of our progress that the human story will end in a destructive apocalypse. I’m less convinced, but open to the idea that I’m wrong.\nSo this, then, isn’t just a conversation about politics and polarization in the present. It’s more fully a conversation about whether the politics of the present are distracting us from the forces that are, even as we speak, deciding our future.\nReferences: \nDave Robert’s piece on Tim Urban’s aversion to politics \nMy conversation with Andrew Yang \nBook recommendations: \nA Little History of the World by E.H. Gombrich \nThe Three-Body Problem by Cixin Liu \nAtomic Habits by James Clear\n\nNew to the show? Want to listen to Ezra's favorite episodes?
