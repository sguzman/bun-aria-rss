Also, Kamala Harris condemns border patrol agents for using whips on Haitian immigrants, even though border patrol agents did not use whips on Haitian immigrants. And BTS performs for the UN general assembly, providing yet another reason to abolish the UN. 500 female sports stars come out in support of abortion rights. I didn’t even know there were 500 female sports stars.
