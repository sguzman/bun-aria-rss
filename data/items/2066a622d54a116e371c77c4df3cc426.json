  "description": "<p>The Therapy for Black Girls Podcast is a weekly conversation with Dr. Joy Harden Bradford, a licensed Psychologist in Atlanta, Georgia, about all things mental health, personal development, and all the small decisions we can make to become the best possible versions of ourselves.</p>\n<p>Over the past few years, you’ve probably found yourself online viewing and reacting to bite size pieces of mental health information. At times in an attempt to better understand ourselves and the world we live in, we digest and share pieces of information that we don’t fully understand or properly reflect our experiences. Take for example the terms trauma bonding, gaslighting, and narcissism. All terms that you’ve probably heard before, and maybe even used in your everyday life. But, are you using them correctly? </p>\n<p>Joining me today for another one of our Group Chat conversations are my friends and colleagues Dr. Ayana Abrams and Dr. Joy Beckwith, both psychologists in Atlanta. During our conversation we break down the definition of key terms we’ve noticed people using online and share suggestions on how to be more mindful around information online. </p>\n<p><strong>Resources</strong></p>\n<p>Visit our <a href=\"https://www.amazon.com/shop/therapy4bgirls\">Amazon Store</a> for all the books mentioned on the podcast.</p>\n<p>Get updates about <a href=\"https://sisterhoodheals.com/\">Sisterhood Heals</a>. </p>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://omny.fm/shows/therapy-for-black-girls/session-250-the-dynamics-of-black-women-working-wi\">group chat conversation</a> where we discussed the dynamics of Black women working with Black women therapists. </p>\n<p>Check out the <a href=\"https://omny.fm/shows/therapy-for-black-girls/session-266-am-i-my-therapists-favorite-client-and\">group chat conversation</a> where we discussed some of the questions you may have been afraid to ask your therapist. </p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Where to Find Dr. Abrams</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.ascensionbehavioralhealth.com/\">Website</a></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/dr_ayanna_a/\">Instagram</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Where to Find Dr. Beckwith</strong></p>\n<p><a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/askdrjoy/?hl=en\">Instagram</a></p>\n<p> </p>\n<p><strong>Stay Connected</strong></p>\n<p>Is there a topic you'd like covered on the podcast?
