  "description": "Zero To One describes how to build efficient start-ups from scratch to build a better future. The future as depicted by Thiel is one which we are in control. The book looks in depth at how to properly plan and execute a start-up that can be as impactful as it is successful. Thiel explains the importance of preparing for the market while making sure the foundations of the start-up are solid before securing constant funding.   Knowing little about start-up culture, I enjoyed Thiel's candidness when describing the harsh realities of establishing a start-up. I particularly enjoyed the parts where Thiel emphasises that we are in control of the start-up. Regardless of the market conditions, competitors or funding, if the business has the right balance between intellectual capacity and purpose, it will succeed in the long-term. This book is for anyone wanting to know the ways we can contribute to making the future better. I rate this book four stars. \n\nOMBR\n\n--- \n\nSend in a voice message: https://anchor.fm/oneminutebookreview/message",
