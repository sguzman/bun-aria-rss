  "description": "Retailers need an edge to stay competitive in today’s market. Listen to Louis Dachis of Ace Spirits and David Driscoll of K&L Wine Merchants on how technology is making their business grow on national level and you get a lesson on distribution and why there are shipping restrictions to different states in the US.\nShow Notes:\n\nTalk about your stores and the markets you serve\n\nHow have you seen the bourbon market effect your business? What's the good what's the bad?\n\nHow does having a very prominent online presence given you an advantage?\n\nDo you see your barrel picks making its way out of state because of online orders? Do you feel that impacts locals?\n\nWe know allocated items in bourbon are coveted right now. How are you dealing with this surge? Do you reward continual shoppers, even online shoppers that are out of state?\n\nIs there a better way to get products into the hands of consumers other than the three-tier system?\n\nWhy are there so many law restrictions on shipping alcohol across state lines? Why can't we have a uniform federal ruling that allows shipment across state lines?\n\nThis goes into global shipping. For example: A Malt like Springbank 21 (700 ml) at Masters of Malt retails for $220ish. Even if I bought only one bottle and paid $40 for ship on the 1 bottle, it is still cheaper than purchasing the 750 ml US version for $390ish. Where do you think a savvy consumer would buy? How will US retail stay competitive in the global marketplace at this rate?\n\nIn an ideal world where you can sell more volume online, what do you want to see changed?",
