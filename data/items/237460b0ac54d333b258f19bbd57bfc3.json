  "description": "Adam Neumann, the once founder of WeWork, who was famously dismissed from the helm of his own company (many books and TV shows ensued), is back on the business scene. He recently received a $350-million check from venture capital firm a16z to help him launch his new project, Flow, which will focus on a sort of rent-to-own business model. But the check he received touched off a firestorm in the world of start-ups, where, many say, most of the investment capital goes to white men.\nIn this installment of Best Of The Gist, we listen back to Mike’s November 26, 2020 interview with Reeves Weideman, contributing editor at New York magazine and author of Billion Dollar Loser: The Epic Rise and Spectacular Fall of Adam Neumann and WeWork. Weideman explains the internal drama inside Neumann’s fast-scaling, overly hyped WeWork, an office space leasing company billed as an in-person social network, as well as the lessons entrepreneurs can learn from disruptors attempting to grow quickly and remain profitable. Then we listen to Mike’s Spiel from this past Tuesday about how Neumann’s new funding has induced rage for some.\nProduced by Joel Patterson and Corey Wara\nEmail us at thegist@mikepesca.com\nTo advertise on the show, visit: https://advertisecast.com/TheGist \nLearn more about your ad choices.
