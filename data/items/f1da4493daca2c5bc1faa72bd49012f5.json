  "description": "<p>In this August 7th, 2018 edition of The Herd with Colin Cowherd, we see Los Angeles Laker forward LeBron James taking on new side projects and endeavors--Colin expects that from a superstar like LeBron as he enters the \"mogul\" stage of his career.  Is LeBron's symbolism in Los Angeles going to be too bright and distracting for his Laker coaches and teammates?  We will see just how much energy is required from LeBron to make the Lakers a winner again while satisfying the demands of being an LA mogul.  Also, New York Giant wide receiver Odell Beckham Jr. is like very few players to have passed through the Big Blue Apple.  Colin weighs the pros and cons of a buttoned-up franchise like the Giants extending a long-term deal to \"edgy\" Odell Beckham Jr.  Finally, Colin sleuths through clues coming from Cleveland: Do Browns coaches separate quarterback and top draft pick Baker Mayfield from the rest of the quarterbacks on Cleveland's roster?  Guests include: Peter King of NBC Sports, FOX Sports Radio host Doug Gottlieb and FS1 NFL contributor T.J. Houshmandzadeh.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
