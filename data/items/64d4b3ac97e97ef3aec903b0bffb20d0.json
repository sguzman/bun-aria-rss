  "description": "<p>What kind of life do you really want to lead? Does consumption and stuff dictate your life more than you’d like? It is so important to examine your own life to discover the small changes you can make right now to give you more freedom to do the things that truly matter most to you. For this interview, we sat down with Chris and Cristi from Life Opted Out to talk about how and why they chose to leave a life they loved in NYC for a much simpler, more affordable life traveling the country in their van. They share that so many of the lessons they’ve learned are not specific to life on the road, and can be applied to anyone looking for more purpose and fulfillment.</p><p>During this episode we both enjoyed a Nothing Left to Give by Orpheus Brewing which you can find on Untappd. A big thanks to Jimmy for donating these beers to the show!
