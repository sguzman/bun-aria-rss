  "description": "<p>The most general vacuum solution to Einstein's field equations with no\nincoming radiation can be constructed perturbatively from two infinite sets of\ncanonical multipole moments, which are found to be mapped into each other under\ngravitational electric-magnetic duality at the non-linear level. We demonstrate\nthat in non-radiative regions such spacetimes are completely characterized by a\nset of conserved celestial charges that consist of the Geroch-Hansen multipole\nmoments, the generalized BMS charges and additional celestial multipoles\naccounting for subleading memory effects. Transitions among non-radiative\nregions, induced by radiative processes, are therefore labelled by celestial\ncharges, which are identified in terms of canonical multipole moments of the\nlinearized gravitational field. The dictionary between celestial charges and\ncanonical multipole moments allows to holographically reconstruct the metric in\nde Donder, Newman-Unti or Bondi gauge outside of sources.\n</p>",
