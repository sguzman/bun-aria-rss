  "description": "One of our regulars, Ed Luce of the Financial Times, had an article in the Weekend FT called \"Will America tear itself apart: The Supreme Court, 2020 elections and a looming constitutional crisis.\" It is an incisive look into a profoundly important set of challenges America faces in fixing elements of our constitutional system that are currently malfunctioning or a source of tension. Government by a super-empowered minority or \"malaportionment\" is one. The related problem of the electoral college is another. The politicization of our judiciary is a third. For this special deep dive into the ideas related to the article we are joined by Ed, governance expert Norm Ornstein of the American Enterprise Institute and, also from AEI, Kori Schake, the head of their foreign policy and national security programs. Join us for this important conversation. \nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
