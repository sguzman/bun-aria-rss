  "description": "Episode 40 is certainly not for the faint hearted. Legendary punk rocker, author & plant powered athlete, John Joseph, takes us through his life and what it was like to grow up in Manhattan in the 60's, 70's and 80's with no money & little family support while being surrounded by some truly bad influences.\n\nIf you do not like swearing or have young kids listening this is not the episode for you. John grew up in some crazy times and did some crazy things to basically stay alive. Despite the colourful language though John has an extremely powerful message and one thing that rang true for me which stood out from our conversation was “its not what happens to someone in life…its what they do about it”.\n\nIn this episode we cover:\n\nJohn's childhood years in Manhattan\n\nWhat trouble he got up to as a teenager & how drugs impacted his life\n\nWhat the punk rock scene was like and how he found himself amongst it\n\nWhy he changed his diet to plant based\n\nWhy he joined the Hare Krishna's\n\nHis time in the navy\n\nBeing on the run from police and using fake identification so he wasn't caught\n\nThe work he is doing with correctional facilities and inmates\n\nHis memoir and his other two books (Meat is for Pussies & The PMA effect)\n\n\nIf you liked this episode please share it on social media and tag myself @plant_proof and John @Johnjosephcromag\n\nHope you enjoy the listen.\n\nSimon\nLearn more about your ad choices.
