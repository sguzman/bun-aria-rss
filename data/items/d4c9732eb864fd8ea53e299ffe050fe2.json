  "title": "Coach Mike Vrabel, DK Metcalf, And Time Traveling",
  "description": "<p>We're time traveling today as we figure out this whole clock switcheroo (2:47 - 6:54). Bracket season is almost upon us with Conference Tournament week and Joe Lunardi is in some beef (6:54 - 11:40). The Lakers look like the best team in the NBA and we have a coronavirus update (11:40 - 19:17). Who's back of the week including coach killing Kyrie and Big Cat believes in the Badgers (19:17 - 29:55). Coach Mike Vrabel joins the show to talk about the improbable run the Titans went on last year, where Tom Brady may end up, and how much he loves to plank (29:55 - 54:15). Seahawks wide receiver DK Metcalf joins the show to squash his beef with PFT and finally race (54:15 - 71:44). Segments include shoe roast for the Rams new logo, tebow update, and Big Cat's idea that he swears will make them millionaires.</p><br /><p>You can find every episode of this show on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or YouTube.
