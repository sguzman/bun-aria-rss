  "description": "<p>This episode was triggering for me and I’m SO glad I had it! Aubrey, NYT best-selling author, is in a very public open-relationship with his fiancé Whitney and is courageous enough to share it with all of us. In this episode we discuss his new book, daily routine what I believe his Dosha is (can you guess) and of course—his open relationship.</p> <p>I asked him questions that were on my mind, such as “Who’s idea was it? Are your other partners mutual friends? Is it a don’t ask, don’t’ tell policy? What are you going to do when you have kids? What if you both fall in love with someone else?” and he answered from a grounded, mature and wise place. It really opened my mind to see someone so vocal and comfortable about the uncertainty of his relationship and though polyamory is NOT for me, it definitely allowed me to understand the perspective much better.<br /> <br /> Connect with Aubrey at @aubreymarcus aubreymarcus.com and check out his new book “Own the Day.”</p> <p>Get 35% off your order of Youveda supplements at youveda.com with code “sahara”</p> <p>Try Vahdam Teas chai sampler by heading over to vahdamteas.com and use coupon code \"sahara\" for 20% off</p> <p>Get 20% off your Organifi Green Juice + Adaptogenic Superfood blends at organifi.com with coupon code \"sahara\"</p> <p>Receive up to $2250 off tuition off my alma mater Institute for Integrative Nutrition, plus my How To Create a Thriving Business Coach Webinar and other exclusive bonuses by signing up and listing my name as your referral!
