  "description": "This week we tackle Christmas on Crimson Mountain by Michelle Major. We were craving a sweet Hallmark-movie-style romance featuring a small town, ice skating, hot chocolate, a winter cabin, a kitten named Jingle, and a heaping dose of Christmas cheer. What we got was that PLUS a beastly widower, a breast cancer survivor, lots of unsolicited grabbery, some light child neglect, and not one but TWO orphans! Buckle up, buttercups. \n Self love recommendations: \n - Shower? This should be a regular life thing, but Melody's in a place. It can wash away whatever's lingering, whether emotional or physical, and smelling nice is always the best way to tackle the day. We gotta start somewhere. \n - If you're injured, take some time for yourself. Don't go cross country skiing and ice skating trying to prove you're an \"American Badass.\" You're not. Also, Melody proves once again that she's not a ice skate-ologist. Take your fancy terms and go to the Chiropractor, Erin! \nMentioned in this episode:\nPreorder Naima Simone X Friends Book Boyfriend Box!!\nThis box has EVERYTHING you could ever want in a book boyfriend from Tessa Bailey, Avery Flynn, Farrah Rochon, Jayci Lee, Kennedy Ryan, Adriana Herrera, and Naima Simone.\nYou can look forward to paperbacks, signed book plates, limited edition book boyfriend mugs, the book boyfriend pajamas/loungewear, bookmarks and more!\nTiers include:\n- Cinnamon Roll - $114.99\n- The Alpha - - $169.99 \nEnter the promo code BONKERS10 at checkout to receive $10 off!!! \nONLY AVAILABLE UNTIL OCT 10, 2022!\nIf you have any questions, email orders@honeymagnolia.co.\nhttps://heaving-bosoms.captivate.fm/nsbookboyfriends (Naima's Book Boyfriends)",
