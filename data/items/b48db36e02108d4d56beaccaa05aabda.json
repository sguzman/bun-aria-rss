But that affordability can also come with unpleasant consequences. Now, the entire industry’s future has been thrown into doubt by a deadly virus.\nCindel Pena was a passenger onboard Carnival’s headline-making “poop cruise.” Ross Klein is a cruise industry expert and professor at Memorial University of Newfoundland. Jim Walker is a Miami-based maritime lawyer and publisher of Cruise Law News.\nPodcast production by Jess Miller and Asha Saluja.\nSlate Plus members get ad-free podcasts and bonus episodes of shows like Dear Prudence and Slow Burn.
