  "description": "This week on the Colin and Samir Podcast, we’re joined by Yes Theory’s head editor, Thomas Dajer. We talk about the ups and downs of what it’s like to be a full time editor, and TD has been editing full time for 4 years now. In those 4 years, Yes Theory has built an audience of over 4 million subscribers and TD has edited videos that have gotten over 416M views on YouTube Alone, including a number of videos that have over 10M views. \nEditing is one of the most important crafts in filmmaking, especially on youtube - it’s where the story comes together, and it’s what separates the good channels from the great ones. Some creators take on the edits themselves and some bring on others to help tell their stories - the bottom line is, without editing, films don’t get made. Editing is also where a lot of creators tend to burn out - long hours, not much sleep, creative roadblocks, software problems, the list goes on. Earlier this year we worked with TD on a documentary for Yes Theory’s channel called “Frozen Alive” and during that time we connected on our love hate relationship with the craft of editing and that’s a big part of what we explore on the show today. \nWe also cover ton of other topics such as personal fulfillment, time and relationship management as a creator and how it feels to be the guy behind the guys.",
