  "title": "PMS 2.0 235 - The Future Of Golf, PGA Champion Collin Morikawa, Plus Legends AJ Hawk & Darius Butler Stop By For Some Great Conversation",
  "description": "<p>On today's show, Pat is joined by NFL Legends AJ Hawk and Darius Butler live from Florida. They discuss the fallout from the Big Ten and Pac-12 postponing their fall football seasons, and what that means for players in those conferences, why we probably won't be getting a super conference after all, and whether or not they think that teams in these conferences will actually try and play a spring season. They also recap the wild 5 Overtime hockey game between the Tampa Bay Lightning and Columbus Blue Jackets and if there should be changes made to the NHL overtime format so that games don't need to be pushed back, whether that game is good or bad for the sport of hockey, and Darius could possibly become the NHL's new biggest fan. The guys also cover the premiere of Hard Knocks and why they think this season with the Chargers and the Rams will be much better than last years lackluster version with the Raiders. They cover Jalen Ramsey and why he's so good, whether or not Jared Goff has the it factor to lead the Rams to the Super Bowl, how each team is handling coronavirus in training camp, and why they're excited for the upcoming weeks (1:12-34:38). Also joining the show is the future of golf, becoming just the 4th golfer to win a PGA Championship before the age of 24 (alongside Tiger, Jack, and Rory) in just his 2nd major, newly crowned PGA Champion, Collin Morikawa. Pat and Collin chat about his incredible weekend at TPC Harding Park in San Francisco, whether or not he can feel when he's in the zone on the golf course, if he had any idea where anybody else on the leaderboard was at on Sunday, his thoughts on Brooks Koepka's comments going into the final round, if he has any superstitions while playing, what his favorite courses to play so far have been, how heavy the Wanamaker trophy actually is, and what is next for him (37:16-54:11).
