  "description": "<p>Author, activist and Benedictine nun Sister Joan Chittister discusses her newest book, <em>The Time Is Now: A Call to Uncommon Courage.</em> In a powerful conversation, Sister Joan defines what it means to be a prophet in today's modern world, and challenges us to combat complacency and apathy in our own lives. She outlines the key steps we can all take to lift America (and the world) out of its current state of polarization and political disarray. Rather than wait for others to solve the problems of inequality, injustice and poverty, Sister Joan explains why it is both our moral and spiritual responsibility to take action ourselves, making the world a better place for all. </p>\n",
