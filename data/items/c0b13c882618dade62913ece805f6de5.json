In this talk, we explore the importance of hope on the spiritual path, its shadow side, and how we can nourish hope through these three elements in a way that serves inner freedom and the healing of our world.</p> <p>\"Let the beauty we love be what we do. There are hundreds of ways to kneel and kiss the ground.\" ~ Rumi</p> <p>Your support enables us to continue to offer these talks and meditations freely.
