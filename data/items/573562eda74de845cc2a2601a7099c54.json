  "description": "<p>Alton, Illinois is a great little river town that Diane has had the pleasure of visiting four times. Haunts and legends abound in this little city with a big history. Many consider this to be one of the most haunted little towns in America. One of its haunted locations is the McPike Mansion. Diane took part in an investigation here and had some pretty amazing experiences that border on full-bodied apparitions. On this episode, she is joined by Kelly and they share their experiences and also share the experiences of listener Tammie Burroughs and her husband Brian and they take you inside the dark session they joined. The Moment in Oddity features the Gentle Giant, Robert Wadlow and This Month in History features the first anti-rabies vaccine being given.</p> <p>Check out the website: <a href= \"http://historygoesbump.com\">http://historygoesbump.com</a></p> <p>Show notes can be found here: <a href= \"https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2019/07/hgb-ep-301-mcpike-mansion.html\"> https://historygoesbump.blogspot.com/2019/07/hgb-ep-301-mcpike-mansion.html</a></p> <p>Become an Executive Producer: <a href= \"http://patreon.com/historygoesbump\">http://patreon.com/historygoesbump</a></p> <p>Music:</p> <p>Vanishing by Kevin MacLeod http://incompetech.com (Moment in Oddity)<br /> In Your Arms by Kevin MacLeod http://incompetech.com (This Month in History)</p> <p>Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License<br /> http://creativecommons.org/licenses/by/3.0/</p> <p>All other music licensing: PODCASTMUSIC.COM License Synchronization, Mechanical, Master Use and Performance Direct License for a Single Podcast Series under current monthly subscription.</p> <p>Mort's Eulogies: Long Time Gone by 5 Alarm Music on Drones & Beyond Album</p> <p>Best Time in Mississippi by Strike Audio</p>",
