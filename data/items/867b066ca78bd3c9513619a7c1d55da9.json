  "description": "<p>From yoga classes to gourmet meals to waterfalls, pre-pandemic offices were built so employees never really wanted to leave. Company culture was a side effect of tangible office perks, and connecting with colleagues was as easy as turning a swivel chair around to join the office discussion about the most recent episode of Game of Thrones. Now, connecting with colleagues is only possible through a screen, and in-office benefits are a thing of the distant past (it's not like a company can ship a ping pong table to their employees' houses). So how do you boost WFH morale? How do you ensure employees are connecting in a meaningful way? How do you build a culture when everyone in the office is apart?</p><p><br />Citrix has created a <a href=\"www.citrix.com/remoteworks\">virtual series</a> on remote work filled with research, tools, and best practices to guide, support, and enable the remote workforce. <br /><br />Chris Voce is the Customer Engagement Strategist at Citrix.
