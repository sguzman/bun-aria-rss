  "description": "You’ve likely heard about the great resignation -- this moment when millions of workers across the country have handed in their notice. Sometimes, people left because they were overworked. Sometimes, it’s because they wanted to change paths, or make more money elsewhere. But for every employee quitting, there’s an employer being quit on. These are stories from the great resignation: Who’s quitting, who’s hiring, and how long this moment is likely to last. \n\nGuests:\nBetsey Stevenson, professor of public policy and economics at the University of Michigan.\nRachel, a recently resigned employee from Massachusetts.\nJulia James, co-owner of Radish and Rye Food Hub in Harrisburg, Pennsylvania. \n\nIf you enjoy this show, please consider signing up for Slate Plus.
