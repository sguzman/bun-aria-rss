  "description": "<p>r/Choosingbeggars This story is pretty nuts. A 41-year-old lawyer decides that he's tired of working, so he actually sues his rich parents for money. Basically, he wants them to pay him a weekly allowance so that he doesn't have to go into work anymore. I should also mention that the dude already lives in a $1,000,000 house that his parents bought for him. Not only did he lose the case, but now he's pretty much guaranteed to be written out of inheritance. How stupid can you be?</p>\n",
