  "description": "<p>Hall & Oates is the biggest-selling vocal duo in history. \"Maneater,\" \"Rich Girl,\" \"You Make My Dreams Come True,\" and countless other hits will be beloved for generations. So Daryl Hall has long been at the top of Alec's Most Wanted list for Here's the Thing. When the conversation finally took place this past December, it was on Hall's home-turf: <a href=\"http://www.wnycstudios.org/darylshouseclub.com/welcome\">Daryl's House</a>, his restaurant and music-venue in Pawling, NY. In a conversation interspersed with some classic recordings, Hall talks about his teen years in suburban Pennsylvania singing doo-wop on the streets with his friends -- a far cry from the rock-star life he was leading 15 years later. For that transition to happen, he first had to meet John Oates. That happened in 1967 when a gunfight broke out at a club they had both been performing at. Their fate was sealed: the two kept up a rigorous concert schedule until this year, when coronavirus put a temporary end to public gatherings. You can still hear their later work on <a href=\"https://www.fridaymusic.com/product/FMLP312/daryl-hall-john-oates-our-kind-of-soul-180-gram-audiophile-vinyllimited-editiongatefold-cover\">this new vinyl release</a> of their masterful album of soul standards, <em>Our Kind of Soul</em>.  Or <a href=\"http://www.wnycstudios.org/%EE%B8%84%20%20https://www.multichannel.com/pr-feed/axs-tv-daryl-hall-live-from-daryls-house-april-19\">tune in to AXS</a> for Hall's hit show <em>Live from Daryl's House</em>. On each episode, he brings another big-name musician up to the club in Pawling and they jam together.</p><p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
