  "description": "<p>The clean energy transition is accelerating — but progress isn’t always smooth.&nbsp;</p><p>The global energy crisis and related price spikes have raised some difficult political questions around the push for decarbonization. At the same time, local opposition to clean energy projects threatens to undermine meeting national net zero goals. Similarly, complexities around accessing materials needed to make cleantech solutions threaten to disrupt the sector.</p><p>These are the kinds of tough issues that longtime climate and energy journalist Amy Harder is used to covering — and continues to cover in her role as executive editor at Cipher, a recently-launched news publication backed by Bill Gates' Breakthrough Energy. In this episode, podcast host Julia Pyper, with co-hosts Brandon Hurlbut and Shane Skelton of policy firm Boundary Stone Partners, speak to Amy about some of the latest trends and challenges in the race to net zero emissions.</p><p>Listen and subscribe to <a href=\"http://www.politicalclimatepodcast.com/\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Political Climate</a> on <a href=\"https://podcasts.apple.com/us/podcast/political-climate/id1371456031?mt=2\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Apple Podcasts</a>, <a href=\"https://open.spotify.com/show/66I35H7m6Sz826sBM7Pce9?si=Xo6roeEBSGePpMyEDKXK7g\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Spotify</a>, <a href=\"https://www.stitcher.com/podcast/the-energy-gang/political-climate\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\" target=\"_blank\">Stitcher</a> or wherever you get podcasts.
