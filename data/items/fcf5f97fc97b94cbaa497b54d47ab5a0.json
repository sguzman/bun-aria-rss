To conduct their own boomer survey, Eric and Joel interview the two boomer investors they know best on this holiday-edition of Trillions: their dads. The men couldn't be more different in their experiences -- one is the ying to the other's yang -- and yet both provide some profound insights into the minds of self-taught investors. They also discuss their experiences with ETFs (one prefers power tools, the other plain-vanilla products) and share what's informed their investing philosophies over the years.</p><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
