  "description": "In Episode #224, I sit down with Dr Tim Spector to address the significance of eating for your specific biology. We discuss research on twins, exploring nature versus nurture; the role of the microbiome in health outcomes; and whether conditions such as obesity and Type 2 diabetes are genetic. Dr Spector also offers advice on adapting your diet to your specific needs.\nWhen we place so much focus on population-level data for health outcomes, it can be easy to lose sight of the unique biology that defines the way each person interacts with food. Dr Tim Spector joins me today to discuss how personalised nutrition may be the key to unlocking the healthiest version of ourselves.\nSpecifically, we discuss:\n\nIntro (0:00)\n\nThe Twin Study (2:33)\n\nHow Medicine Has Changed (7:24)\n\nObesity: Genetics & The Microbiome (13:30)\n\nHow much Genetics plays a role (23:36)\n\nZooming in on the Microbiome (32:36)\n\nBig Picture (54:37)\n\nArtificial Sweeteners (1:05:30)\n\nChanging the Microbiome (1:14:58)\n\nBlood Glucose (1:18:18)\n\nBlood Lipids (1:26:40)\n\nVision for the Future (1:32:22)\n\nOutro (1:35:45)\n\n\nIf you found this conversation informative, Dr Tim Spector has an abundance of resources and contact points available.
