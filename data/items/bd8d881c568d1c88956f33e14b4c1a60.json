  "description": "<p>Recently, we both launched a series of paintings via our websites, and in this episode, we discuss the experience and what we learned. For both of us, this was a relatively new experience - Alice usually launches her new works at in-person events and Louise has traditionally added paintings to her website on an ad-hoc basis, rather than as a series. Both our launches went well, and we hope our experiences can help you plan something similar.&nbsp; In a wide-ranging conversation, we cover the benefits of building (and communicating regularly with) a mailing list; the importance of storytelling in sales, and the value of thoughtful presentation. We also discuss the downsides of selling this way, including the inevitable fear of failing in public, and the amount of time required for emailing buyers, packaging, and arranging shipping. As an extra bonus, we introduce the word \"wally\" and \"sodding\" to listeners outside the UK (you're welcome).&nbsp;&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Correction!! I made a mistake (blame menopause brain!) the artist I mentioned is Amy Dury (not Sarah) and you can find her on Instagram @amy_dury&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Mentioned Louise's private view page: <a href=\"//\">https://www.louisefletcherart.com/private-view&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p>Alice's Wild Swimming collection 2021 <a href=\"//\">https://alicesheridan.com/wildswimming/</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p>See a previous more complete virtual event listing here: <a href=\"//\">https://alicesheridan.com/artistsathome2020/&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p>Find our websites and sign up for our newsletters at:&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"//\">www.alicesheridan.com</a>&nbsp;</p>\n<p><a href=\"//\">www.louisefletcherart.com&nbsp;</a></p>\n<p>Follow us on Instagram:&nbsp;</p>\n<p>@alicesheridanstudio&nbsp;</p>\n<p>@louisefletcher_art&nbsp;</p>\n<p>Credits:<br>\n\"Monkeys Spinning Monkeys\" Kevin MacLeod (incompetech.com) Licensed under Creative Commons: By Attribution 3.0 License</p>\n",
