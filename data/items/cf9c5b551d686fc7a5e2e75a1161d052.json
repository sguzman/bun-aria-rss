They want plenty of opportunities to develop, and that is how they choose their workplace.

That is not top of their mind. Instead, well-being is. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">They are individuals that are highly aware of social and environmental issues and do not shy away from taking action to live the life that they desire. They are individuals that are aspirational but are not willing to give up their work-life balance to enter the rat race. </span></p>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Is your workplace ready for this group of young professionals?

Always work towards formulating a good work/life balance, allowing them to learn and develop. This can be done through online learning, in-house training, or mentorship.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Facilitate better communication with them. This is crucial, especially if your team is working remotely. The usage of project management tools like </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Monday.com</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Trello</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">, </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Asana</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and screen recording apps like </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Loom</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> helps to build effective communication across teams too.  </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Give them the flexibility to work remotely because benefits like that will enable them to become more productive and out-put driven.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Set up incentives. Schedule (and pay for!) team lunches or coffee breaks periodically to show them your appreciation. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Create challenges and embrace gamification, which can also be done remotely through </span><a rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://creativeformore.slack.com/apps/category/At0EFT6893-hr-team-culture\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">features on communication channels like Slack</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Gather</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">.</span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Organise monthly team bonding events &#8211; social events and outings, to adapt to a new remote work lifestyle. Even if you are physically apart, you can also organise virtual team-building initiatives. Some examples include </span><a rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://www.escaperoom.sg/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Virtual Escape Rooms</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> and </span><a rel=\"follow\" href=\"https://www.virtualamazingrace.com/\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Virtual Amazing Race</span></a><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Foster job satisfaction, look into their personal development and offer training. Companies like </span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">General Assembly</span><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\"> offers corporate training packages to serve this purpose. </span></li>\n<li style=\"font-weight: 400;\" aria-level=\"1\"><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Be open and strategic toward sharing future company plans. Gen Zs want to know how a company is performing regularly, and they want to play a part in how they can contribute to the company’s north star metric, so it is important to keep them in the loop at all times. </span></li>\n<li aria-level=\"1\">Ask them for insights and feedback on how to improve your business processes. You can do so using tools like Free Suggestion Box, Incognea, Peachymondays and Tinypulse.  When you are entrenched in projects, your team will often develop insights you may not see as a business owner.</li>\n</ul>\n<p><span style=\"font-weight: 400;\">Start building or refining these initiatives because being able to constantly innovate and adapt will give your company a tremendous competitive advantage down the road!</span></p>\n<p>&#8211;</p>\n<p>Editor’s note: <b >e27</b> aims to foster thought leadership by publishing views from the community.
