  "description": "<p>Listening to the Song - Part 2 (2017-03-01) - Listening is more than a communications skill, it is a capacity that awakens our awareness. As we learn to listen inwardly, we begin to understand and care for the life that is here. And as we listen to others, that same intimacy emerges. In this two-part series we examine the blocks to listening and the practices that cultivate this essential domain of human potential. Our focus is both on the transformational power of listening in our personal lives, and also the necessity for deep listening if we are to bring healing to our wider society.</p> <p>Your support enables us to continue to offer these talks freely. If you value them, I hope you will consider offering a donation at this time at <a href=\"https://www.tarabrach.com/donation/\" target= \"_blank\">www.tarabrach.com/donation/</a>.</p> <p>With gratitude and love, Tara</p>",
