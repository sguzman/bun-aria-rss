  "description": "When the Israelites were going to possess the Promised Land, God said, “Little by little I will drive your enemies out before you, until you have increased enough to take possession of the land” (Exodus 23:30). God started small, slowly decreasing the enemies because He wanted His people to go big. He wanted them to grow their own capacity to be able to handle what He was going to give them in the future. He didn’t want the land to overtake them. He wanted them to overtake the land. God was increasing them incrementally throughout their journey. God wants to increase us, but oftentimes we overlook the small things because we want to go big. Remember, a majestic oak tree starts with a small seed.<p> </p> Learn more about your ad-choices at <a href=\"https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com\">https://www.iheartpodcastnetwork.com</a><p>See <a href=\"https://omnystudio.com/listener\">omnystudio.com/listener</a> for privacy information.</p>",
