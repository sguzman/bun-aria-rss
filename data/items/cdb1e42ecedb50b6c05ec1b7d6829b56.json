  "description": "In Episode 47, What Happened to Bradley?, we take you to Coliseum and State, the intersection of two boulevards in Fort Wayne where, around 10 p.m. on Nov. 19, 2004, two men were struck by a 2004 Dodge Stratus that ran a red light. The driver of the Stratus fled and has never been identified. Investigators assumed Bradley Dale Ross was behind the wheel. After all, the vehicle belonged to his fiancée, Sarah. But Bradley’s sister tells The Vanished that he would never have dropped off the grid as many believed he has, not with a child on the way. In this episode, show producer, Nathan, and The Vanished host and creator, Marissa, grapple with a timeline that doesn’t line up as neatly as it should. Things get stranger still when we called detective Cary Young and realized a missed connection may have allowed a murder to slip through the cracks. \n\nSee Privacy Policy at https://art19.com/privacy and California Privacy Notice at https://art19.com/privacy#do-not-sell-my-info.",
