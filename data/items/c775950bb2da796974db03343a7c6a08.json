  "description": "The Washington debate over whether and how much to invest in our infrastructure and our people has reached a telling and pivotal moment. We discuss the moment and where it is likely to lead with EJ Dionne of the Washington Post, Norm Ornstein of AEI and Dr. Kavita Patel, former of the Obama White House. Much hangs in the balance here and the real story is not coming out in the media or, often, out of the mouths of political leaders. We try to shed some light on what is really happening. Don't miss it.\nSupport this show http://supporter.acast.com/deepstateradio.\n See acast.com/privacy for privacy and opt-out information.\nLearn more about your ad choices.
