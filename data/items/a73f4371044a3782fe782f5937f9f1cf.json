  "description": "<p>Human-sucking mud holes. Beautiful birdsongs. Early mornings. Eyeball gnats. Stunning vistas. The long-awaited episode with ornithologist Corina Newsome is finally here and we talk all about the day-to-day-realities of being a Wildlife Ecologist. She dishes about working in zoos, getting her masters, housing for grad students, nest checking, birding apps, camera traps, #BlackBirdersWeek, and more. She is hilarious, informative, and dedicated to her work in avian conservation and truly has the best laugh. Also: saxophones in the bushes and whether or not animals are laughing at her.</p><p>Visit Corina Newsome’s <a href=\"https://corinanewsome.wixsite.com/hoodnaturalist\" target=\"_blank\">website</a>, <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/hood__naturalist/?hl=en\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a> and <a href=\"https://twitter.com/hood_naturalist\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a></p><p>A donation was made to<a href=\"https://www.doctorswithoutborders.org\"> </a><a href=\"https://www.skypeascientist.com/\" target=\"_blank\">SkypeAScientist.com</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.alieward.com/ologies/wildlifeecology\" target=\"_blank\">More episode sources and links</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.alieward.com/ologies-sponsors\" target=\"_blank\">Sponsors of Ologies</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.alieward.com/ologies-extras\" target=\"_blank\">Transcripts & bleeped episodes</a></p><p><a href=\"https://www.patreon.com/ologies\" target=\"_blank\">Become a patron of Ologies</a> for as little as a buck a month</p><p><a href=\"https://www.ologiesmerch.com\" target=\"_blank\">OlogiesMerch.com</a> has hats, shirts, totes, masks… </p><p>Follow @ologies on <a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/ologies\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/ologies\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></p><p>Follow @alieward on <a href=\"https://www.twitter.com/AlieWard\" target=\"_blank\">Twitter</a> and <a href=\"https://www.instagram.com/AlieWard\" target=\"_blank\">Instagram</a></p><p>Sound editing by <a href=\"https://www.jarrettsleeper.com\" target=\"_blank\">Jarrett Sleeper</a> of MindJam Media & <a href=\"https://www.stevenraymorris.com\" target=\"_blank\">Steven Ray Morris</a></p><p>Transcripts by Emily White of <a href=\"https://www.thewordary.com\" target=\"_blank\">The Wordary</a></p><p>Website by <a href=\"https://www.kellyrdwyer.com/photo\" target=\"_blank\">Kelly R.
