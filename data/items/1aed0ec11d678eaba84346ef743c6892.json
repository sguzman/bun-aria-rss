  "title": "Andrew Gosden - 288",
  "description": "<p>September 14, 2007. King's Cross Railway Station, London, UK. A bright young student named Andrew Gosden leaves for school one day. His family didn't know it, but Andrew waited for them to leave then returned home and changed into his street clothes and headed for the Doncaster railway station after withdrawing £200 from a cash machine. When his parents discovered that he was missing they began to look for him. Once they learned that he had purchased a one way ticket to London their concern grew. Andrew wasn't someone who just left like that. He had a perfect attendance record at school and was always reliable. Though it took police weeks to get the CCTV footage from King's Cross railway station in London, they were able to locate Andrew in it. What was Andrew doing there? Why did he leave? Had he planned to visit a relative or a friend? If so, then why has no one heard from Andrew in more than 10 years?
