  "description": "Taya Smith of Hillsong United joins Sadie with her relatable and powerful story, and it's impossible not to see Jesus in everything she says. The \"Oceans\" singer talks about her decision to move to Sydney to be a recording artist, living paycheck to paycheck while working in retail, her tryout for \"The Voice,\" and the best lunch of her life. Sadie and Taya also discuss God's behind-the-scenes work, why we're not supposed to be \"adults of God,\" finding the confidence to freely live out who you are, the times we struggle to worship, and what the Holy Spirit told Taya about shaving her head. Then, a caller asks Sadie and Christian a question about overcoming insecurity.\nLearn more about your ad choices. Visit megaphone.fm/adchoices",
