  "description": "<p>June 1st, 1998. Slide Mountain, Nevada. Peter Bergna and his wife Rinette were involved in a deadly accident on Slide Mountain, near Reno, Nevada. The truck they were traveling in fell 800 feet down the mountain, killing Rinette upon impact. Miraculously, Peter survived, somehow managing to jump out the driver’s side window. Immediately crash site investigators noticed that the evidence didn’t match Peter’s story, leading to a criminal investigation and Peter’s conviction for first-degree murder. Did Peter intentionally crash to kill his wife when he grew unhappy with the marriage, or was it a tragic accident that led to a wrongful conviction?</p><p>Want bonus episodes of Generation Why?
