  "description": "In Episode #225 I sit down with Alan Flanagan, PhD to discuss the health implications of consuming dairy. We have a broader conversation about misinformation and public health before specifically examining the health outcomes of dairy consumption. We also cover whether you can trust industry-funded studies, the representation of dairy on social media, and how much information we actually have.\nMisinformation is an ongoing occurrence in online nutrition conversations. The capacity to spread misinformation to huge audiences is only a few clicks away, and many laypeople aren’t equipped to accurately evaluate these claims. Similarly, there are many instances where ideology may influence people to ignore the evidence. Dr Alan Flanagan joins me today to discuss this in the context of dairy.\nSpecifically, we cover:\n\nIntro (0:00)\n\nWhy we’re discussing Dairy (2:32)\n\nSocial Media & Industry Funding (13:22)\n\nCardiovascular Disease (23:40)\n\nDairy Compared to What? (35:58)\n\nThe PURE Study (52:48)\n\nMetabolic Health (1:02:33)\n\nBlood Glucose (1:10:32)\n\nWeight Gain (1:15:56)\n\nInflammation (1:21:19)\n\nCancer (1:29:24)\n\nAcne (1:38:23)\n\nBone Health (1:43:45)\n\nBringing it all Together (1:58:50)\n\nOutro (2:02:03)\n\n\nTo connect with Dr Alan Flanagan, you can do so via his Instagram.
