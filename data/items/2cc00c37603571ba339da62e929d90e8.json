  "description": "Alice Backwell is an Australian native living in Berlin, and she's in the process of producing a podcast about the state of women's health in Germany. In this mini-episode from Vocal Fry, Jill and Alice discuss why Alice decided to produce a podcast, what issues she hopes to cover, and what Vocal Fry listeners can do to help crowdsource a Berlin guide to women's health. They also discuss women's boxing and the upcoming boxing camp for Berlin's women / non-binary / transgender people coming up this summer.<br /><br />We are looking for the voices of real people living in Berlin who have firsthand experience with the women's health system. We'd love to hear from you, and of course, anonymity is possible.<br /><br />To leave resources or tips for Alice: <a href=\"mailto:WomensHealthPodcast.com@gmail.com\">WomensHealthPodcast.com@gmail.com</a>",
