A leader in the emergent world of&nbsp;conscious media, Preston is a pretty unique cat — one of the most&nbsp;present, focused, passionate, open and giving people I have ever met. But honestly, everything that Preston is can be boiled down to one word – maybe the most important word in our lexicon –&nbsp;love.</p><p>A wellspring of creativity, Preston is a writer (Huff Po / The Daily Love), a motivational messenger, a thought leader and co-founder of something called&nbsp;<a href=\"http://www.thelovemob.org/\" target=\"_blank\">The Love Mob</a>&nbsp;– a global, grassroots flash mob movement that ignites community building through “Organized Acts of Love.”</p><br><p>The Preston I know is an unlikely evolution from a very different guy. Raised under challenging circumstances, young Preston was a hyperactive, dyslexic gang member prone to beatings and beating others. An angry, disenfranchised young man looking at an almost certain future of violence, drug abuse, jails and institutions.</p><p>But Preston was able to escape this path. An emotional and spiritual transformation that instead produced a man full of life, devoted to serving others and downright unafraid to embrace and exude love, consciousness and unity — hardly the most popular subjects among men in our society.</p><br><p>Preston is both a friend and an inspiration, and I am proud to share his powerful story and message with you today.</p><p>I sincerely hope you enjoy the conversation.

Identify the negative patterns that constantly loop. Make a choice to take one of those thoughts and invert it. It doesn’t matter if you don’t actually believe the new message you tell yourself about yourself – just act as if. Do that, repeat it until it becomes the new default thought replacing the old negative one.
