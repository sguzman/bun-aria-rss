  "description": "<p><strong>You've been secretly chatting with an old flame whose torch you still carry</strong>, and you even met in person to discover that these feelings are mutual. But there's a big hitch: while you're now single again, she's in what seems to be an otherwise happy marriage and is mother to three. Now you feel frustrated, jealous, and even heartbroken because you can't be with her. Or <em>can</em> you? We'll try to help you find answers to this and more here on Feedback Friday!</p>\n<p>And in case you didn't already know it, <strong>Jordan Harbinger</strong> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/JordanHarbinger\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@JordanHarbinger</a>) and <strong>Gabriel Mizrahi</strong> (<a href=\"https://twitter.com/GabeMizrahi\" target=\"_blank\" rel=\"noopener noreferrer\">@GabeMizrahi</a>) banter and take your comments and questions for Feedback Friday right here every week!
