  "description": "In Episode 91 it's you and me again for another Solo Episode of the Plant Proof Podcast. As usual this episode, focussed on weight loss, is about clearing confusion, breaking down the science and giving you practical tips to walk away with that hopefully allow you to lead a healthier, more sustainable & happier lifestyle.\n\nIn this episode I cover:\n\n\nFat shaming versus educating about reducing disease risk\n\nSocial media and body image\n\nWhat factors control weight gain or weight loss?\n\nWhat dietary patterns are best for weight loss?\n\nWhy ultra-processed foods may affect your results?\n\nAre high fat or low fat diets best for weight loss?\n\nKetogenic diets and weight loss - a few things to consider\n\nDo carbohydrates promote weight gain?\n\nHow does exercise affect weight loss?\n\nIs intermittent fasting useful for weight loss?\n\nHow quickly should we lose weight?\n\nHow to stay fuller for longer?\n\nImportance of adherence\n\nand much much more including plenty of what I hope are helpful tips\n\n\nAll in all friends this episode is not about obsessing over belly rolls or cellulite. My aim was to bring you the science minus any fads, quick fixes or any other strategies that get you reaching for your wallet - I simply want you to understand what factors affect your body weight so you can be empowered to take control of your health. I do need to acknowledge that there is an element of privilege associated with being able to implement the information I am sharing. I understand our food system is set up in a way that makes it hard to lose weight - it's called the obesogenic environment after all. Cheap, convenient foods are usually the most unhealthiest. With that said, you can only do the best in your circumstances and by no means do I want you to feel any less about yourself if you are simply doing your best and run off your feet with multiple kids, lots of bills etc, I totally get it - it's the thought and effort that matters most.\n\n\nResources/References:\n\nKevin Hall's study on Ultra-processed foods versus unprocessed\nLow Fat vs High fat diets in metabolic ward setting - a systematic review of 32 controlled feeding studies\nPlant Proof healthy plant based food pyramid\n\n \nHope you enjoy the episode friends.\n\nWant to support the show?\nIf you are enjoying the Plant Proof podcast a great way to support the show is by leaving a review on the Apple podcast app. It only takes a few minutes and helps more people find the episodes.\n\nSimon Hill, Nutritionist, Sports Physiotherapist\nCreator of Plantproof.com and host of the Plant Proof Podcast\nAuthor of The Proof is in the Plants\nConnect with me on Instagram and Twitter\nDownload my two week meal plan\nLearn more about your ad choices.
