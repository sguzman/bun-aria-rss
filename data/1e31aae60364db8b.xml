        <![CDATA[<p>If you were online during the historic 2020 election cycle, you may have seen Sharon McMahon’s viral videos. A former high school educator now known as “America’s Government Teacher,” Sharon fights polarization with nonpartisan facts. Sharon and Adam discuss how we can rethink the qualifications for elected office, who decides to run, and what information voters should weigh. They also address ways to sharpen critical thinking and ponder how to improve Congress with a few thought experiments–including a total takeover of the House and Senate by none other than America’s government teachers.

      <title>Reese Witherspoon on turning impostor syndrome into confidence</title>

        <![CDATA[<p>When Reese Witherspoon was in rehearsals for her lead role in the 2005 film Walk the Line, she wanted to quit–every day. But she went on to win the Oscar for her performance as June Carter Cash. Since then, she’s gone from playing iconic roles in films (Legally Blonde, Election, Water for Elephants) to also producing and starring in her own TV shows and movies (Little Fires Everywhere, Big Little Lies, Wild). Reese talks to Adam about how she's built confidence by facing her doubts head on, and shares why acknowledging what she doesn’t know has helped her found a company–which was recently acquired for $900 million–that finally puts women at the center of their stories.

      <title>How Celeste Ng writes fiery prose</title>
      <pubDate>Tue, 11 Oct 2022 09:00:00 -0000</pubDate>

      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>It took Celeste Ng a long time to believe she could write for a living. Now she’s the New York Times bestselling author of the novels “Everything I Never Told You” and “Little Fires Everywhere”-- which was developed into a hit TV show by Reese Witherspoon’s production company, Hello Sunshine.

      <title>Malcolm Gladwell Experiments with Adam's Class</title>

      <link>https://audiocollective.ted.com</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>This week, we’re sharing a special episode from one of Adam's favorite podcasts, Revisionist History. Revisionist History is Malcolm Gladwell’s podcast about things misunderstood and overlooked. This season, Malcolm is obsessed with experiments – natural experiments, scientific experiments, thought experiments. And in this episode, Adam Grant got to help out. Malcolm wanted to talk with a group of college seniors or recent graduates. So Adam invited him to a special seminar at the University of Pennsylvania’s Wharton School. Adam’s students become guinea pigs as Malcom tries to help them identify and then discuss a very specific type of privilege, a category of privilege that’s often ignored. If you know Malcolm Gladwell, he does sometimes seem to have it out for Ivy League schools like Penn. But this episode is not what you might expect: Malcolm winds up pointing the finger of blame quite firmly in his own direction, too. <br>

      <title>How free solo climber Alex Honnold faces fear</title>
      <pubDate>Tue, 20 Sep 2022 14:00:00 -0000</pubDate>
      <link>https://audiocollective.ted.com</link>
      <description>
        <![CDATA[<p>In 2017, Alex Honnold did what even the world’s best rock climbers thought was impossible. He climbed to the top of El Capitan– a granite rock mountain more than 3,000 feet high– without a rope, harness, or net. His audacious feat was the subject of the Oscar-winning documentary “Free Solo,” and it left Adam with some burning questions about what we can learn from his unique approach to managing fear. Alex opens up about how he regulates his emotions when he’s hanging on by just a few fingers, what still scares him, and how he stays motivated to pursue ambitious goals.

        <![CDATA[In 2017, Alex Honnold did what even the world’s best rock climbers thought was impossible. He climbed to the top of El Capitan– a granite rock mountain more than 3,000 feet high– without a rope, harness, or net. His audacious feat was the subject of the Oscar-winning documentary “Free Solo,” and it left Adam with some burning questions about what we can learn from his unique approach to managing fear. Alex opens up about how he regulates his emotions when he’s hanging on by just a few fingers, what still scares him, and how he stays motivated to pursue ambitious goals.

        <![CDATA[<p>Great news WorkLifers! You told us you wanted more episodes of Taken for Granted, and we listened. We’ve renamed the show Re:Thinking with Adam Grant, and we’ll be back with more episodes, all year round. In every episode Adam will host lively discussions and debates with the world’s most fascinating thinkers, creators, achievers, and leaders to figure out what makes them tick. Adam will bring curiosity and science to conversations with people like entrepreneur and investor Mark Cuban, death-defying rock climber Alex Honnold, novelist Celeste Ng, Oscar winner Reese Witherspoon, Nobel Prize-winning Saul Perlmutter, the physicist who discovered the expansion of the universe, and many more. How do they think–and what do they challenge us all to rethink? Find out on ReThinking with Adam Grant on Apple Podcasts, Spotify or wherever you listen.</p>]]>

        <![CDATA[<p>Michael Scott, Leslie Knope, Detective Jake Peralta–television producer and writer Michael Schur has created some of TV’s most beloved sitcom characters on shows like The Office, Parks and Recreation, and The Good Place. Still, his shows and his philosophy are not just about laughs. Today on The TED Interview, another podcast in the TED Audio Collective, Michael Schur sits down with host Steven Johnson. They dive into the craft of writing the TV comedy, why he is obsessed with philosophy and ethics, and what he’s learned from both the fictional and the real workplace about how humans behave, grow, and love. Michael’s New York Times-bestselling book “How to Be Perfect: The Correct Answer to Every Moral Question” is out now. <br>

      <title>Is Emotional Intelligence Really So Important? | No Stupid Questions</title>

        <![CDATA[<p>Today, something a little different. We're sharing an episode of No Stupid Questions, a podcast about human behavior hosted by Adam’s colleague and friend Angela Duckworth—a worldwide expert on grit—and Stephen Dubner, host of Freakonomics Radio. In this episode, Angela and Stephen debate whether emotional intelligence is necessary for good leadership. Stephen also wonders if emotional intelligence is something that can be learned, and the two discuss whether high E.I. might actually have negative repercussions. To hear more episodes on the weird and wonderful ways that humans behave, follow No Stupid Questions wherever you're listening to this.</p>

In this episode, Jon talks with Adam about the creative process of making his genre-defying music, his prodigious background as a young musician in New Orleans, the role of focus and variety in building a successful career, and the power of art to make real change.<br>

But flexibility is much more than WHERE you work–it also means having the freedom to make choices about what you work on, who you work with, and when and how often you work. This episode examines the science and practice of creating more autonomy– and making it work for people and organizations.

        <![CDATA[<p>Dolly Parton is a living legend. Her hit songs like “9 to 5”, “Jolene”, and “I Will Always Love You” have captured generation after generation, and her career is far from slowing down.

In today’s episode, Adam talks to Dolly about her creative process, how she balances getting things right with getting things DONE, and how she manages the hefty cup of ambition she pours herself each morning.

        <![CDATA[<p>PepsiCo's trailblazing former CEO drove record profits—but did so while investing in employee well-being, consumer health, and environmental sustainability. In their second conversation, she and Adam are on stage for a lively, entertaining dialogue about how to improve our work lives and our workplaces. They talk about striking a balance between fitting in and standing out, winning support for major change up and down the org chart, and rethinking business education. Indra also reveals the name of the only world leader who ever intimidated her and why she doesn’t care who wins the battle between Pepsi and Coke.

        <![CDATA[PepsiCo's trailblazing former CEO drove record profits—but did so while investing in employee well-being, consumer health, and environmental sustainability. In their second conversation, she and Adam are on stage for a lively, entertaining dialogue about how to improve our work lives and our workplaces. They talk about striking a balance between fitting in and standing out, winning support for major change up and down the org chart, and rethinking business education. Indra also reveals the name of the only world leader who ever intimidated her and why she doesn’t care who wins the battle between Pepsi and Coke.

In the first of two rich conversations, she explains why she wrote more than 400 letters about her direct reports… to their parents.

        <![CDATA[<p>At the age of 18, Allyson Felix took home the Olympic silver medal in the 200 meter dash. She was devastated. Where others saw “second-best in the world,” she only saw “not first.” That race lit a fire that would carry her on to become the most decorated track and field athlete in American history. Adam talks with her about achieving excellence, bouncing back from her so-called “failures,” and sustaining motivation to medal in five straight Olympic games.

Have you found yourself staying up late, joylessly bingeing TV shows and doomscrolling through the news, or simply navigating your day uninspired and aimless? Chances are you're languishing—a psychic malaise that has become all too common after many months of the pandemic. Adam breaks down the key indicators of languishing and presents three ways to escape that "meh" feeling and start finding your flow.

        <![CDATA[<p>In a world obsessed with efficiency, Lin-Manuel Miranda’s smash Broadway hits Hamilton and In the Heights began with idle curiosity. Adam interviews Lin together with his father, Luis, about finding harmony between creativity and productivity—and rhythm between work and life. They discuss what motivated Lin to take a big risk on the biggest stage of his life, the challenges of fitting in when you stand out, the importance of delegation and deadlines, and the lost art of doing nothing.

        <![CDATA[Criticism rarely comes wrapped in a shiny gift box, tied with a bow. As a trailblazing leader, one of Mellody Hobson’s gifts is finding the diamond in the rough. She and Adam unpack how to look for the grain of truth in any critique, when to discount feedback, and what it takes to be honest without being brutal.

        <![CDATA[<p>It’s been 25 years since the concept of emotional intelligence exploded onto the scene. Cultural critic Merve Emre makes a bold case that in the wrong hands, it can be used to exploit people. We unpack the surprising roots of emotional intelligence, how it’s been co-opted as a form of corporate control, and why you might want to rethink some of your core assumptions about emotions at work.

        <![CDATA[<p>“I can’t do this.” “I didn’t deserve this promotion.” “When will they find me out?” If you’ve had thoughts like these, you aren’t alone. Nearly 70% of people have experienced imposter syndrome—even some of the most successful ones! The difference is in how they can use imposter thoughts as fuel, rather than a fire to burn them out. Adam shares three steps you can take to harness your own self-doubt as a fuel for success, and why we stand to gain more from embracing our insecurities rather than hiding from them.

        <![CDATA[<p>Workers are now expecting more from their employers beyond a paycheck and benefits. Employees want an employer who lines up with their values outside of work and stands up in the name of justice. And when they don’t, employees are becoming more active about asking their companies to cancel partnerships or are walking out in protest--as we’ve seen with workers at Facebook, Google and others.</p>

<p>A company is not a democracy, but it doesn't work when it's a dictatorship. Employees are embracing activism, calling on their employers to take a stand on social and political issues.

        <![CDATA[<p>We’ve all been to bias training, but it rarely works—and sometimes backfires. Science suggests that to drive real change, it’s not enough to run one-off workshops. We need to change individual and organizational habits. Find out how people can overcome their own prejudices and workplaces can break barriers to help marginalized groups advance into leadership roles.

      <title>Why it Pays to Raise Pay</title>

        <![CDATA[<p>When employees are paid more, they give more. Going above market pay might sound like a fantasy, but in a growing number of companies it’s becoming a profitable reality. Peek inside workplaces that have reinvented their pay structures to give employees their worth and more—and explore the science of how it can pay off for everyone in the long run. Note: This episode was published in May 2021, and features an employee at Gravity Payments, whose founder and longtime CEO has stepped down in light of serious allegations of sexual misconduct.  The behavior reported by the New York Times is completely unacceptable and not condoned by TED or any parties that contributed to the episode. Our focus in this episode is not on Dan Price, but on what can be learned from an experiment at the company on raising pay.

        <![CDATA[<p>Author and activist Glennon Doyle used to say “I am a Christian. I am straight. I am an addict.” Now she simply says “I am.” In this episode, Doyle sits down with Adam to discuss letting go of past identities — and rethinking the idea of identity as a whole. They explore insights from Doyle’s bestselling book, Untamed, on dealing with unpleasant emotions, redefining weaknesses and redefining ourselves. Warning: their conversation might lead you to start redefining yourself. For more from Glennon, check out her new podcast We Can Do Hard Things.

        <![CDATA[<p>Author and activist Glennon Doyle used to say “I am a Christian. I am straight. I am an addict.” Now she simply says “I am.” In this episode, Doyle sits down with Adam to discuss letting go of past identities — and rethinking the idea of identity as a whole. They explore insights from Doyle’s bestselling book, Untamed, on dealing with unpleasant emotions, redefining weaknesses and redefining ourselves. Warning: their conversation might lead you to start redefining yourself. For more from Glennon, check out her new podcast We Can Do Hard Things.

        <![CDATA[<p>Over the last year, in the wake of George Floyd’s murder, many companies have paid lip service to racial inclusion. But what does it actually take to change individuals — and the structures and cultures of organizations? In the first of two episodes on bias, psychologist John Amaechi shares powerful insights on inclusion — and several experts weigh in on the latest science of privilege, allyship, and opportunity at work. A key takeaway: your culture is defined by the worst behavior you tolerate.

        <![CDATA[<p>Whether it's over a project, politics, or pizza toppings, conflict with colleagues is inevitable. The goal is not to eliminate it; it’s to handle it better. There’s a whole science of managing individual and team conflicts, and it suggests that we don’t have to agree to disagree. We need to start by understanding what our clashes are actually about—because often, we’re not arguing about what we THINK we’re arguing about at all.

        <![CDATA[<p>Everyone’s career will hit some turbulence at some point. The past year has left us all reacting to dramatic change. Instead of pushing harder against the headwinds, we’re sometimes better off tilting our rudder and charting a new course. In this episode, hear from people who have taken unusual steps to battle uncertainty, rethought their approach to finding and landing a job, and reached out for help in unexpected places—as well as an expert on recessions who forecasts the future by looking to the past.

      <title>How to Rethink a Bad Decision</title>

        <![CDATA[<p>In life and work, we have a hard time changing course. When we wind up in a miserable job, a failing project, or a floundering romantic relationship, we rationalize, make excuses, and stick with our bad decisions—even when the writing's on the wall. Why? Usually we assume the driving force is sunk costs: we don't want to admit we've wasted that time or money. But in fact, the root of our stubbornness is a psychological trap called “escalation of commitment.” Once we understand that, we can start taking steps to protect ourselves from… well, ourselves.

        <![CDATA[<p>In life and work, we have a hard time changing course. When we wind up in a miserable job, a failing project, or a floundering romantic relationship, we rationalize, make excuses, and stick with our bad decisions—even when the writing's on the wall. Why? Usually we assume the driving force is sunk costs: we don't want to admit we've wasted that time or money. But in fact, the root of our stubbornness is a psychological trap called “escalation of commitment.” Once we understand that, we can start taking steps to protect ourselves from… well, ourselves.

        <![CDATA[<p>Daniel Kahneman is a Nobel Prize winner who transformed our understanding of the biases that cloud our thinking. In this conversation, he and Adam explore when to trust our intuition and when to second-guess it. Danny explains how he finds joy in being wrong, spells out steps to smarter interviewing, and reveals how he—the master decoder of decision-making—makes decisions.

      <title>Malcolm Gladwell Questions Everything</title>

        <![CDATA[<p>When Adam Grant and Malcolm Gladwell sit down to challenge each other, everything is fair game. Sit ringside for this collegial cage match in which two preeminent writers rethink each other's ideas in an insatiable quest to get closer to the truth. Is intelligence undersold or oversold? Does individual blaming and shaming obscure the pursuit of real change on racism? Could rethinking everything lead not only to a better business but a better life? In pursuit of answers, Grant and Gladwell agree on this much: you shouldn't believe everything you think.

        <![CDATA[<p>We usually wear our thickest armor at work, and Brené Brown has blazed the trail of teaching us why—and how to shed it. In this conversation, Adam and Brené unpack the power of showing vulnerability at work—and explore how much is too much. Learn when and where to set boundaries, find out how to get more comfortable with being uncomfortable, and hear Brené rethink a key assumption that she took for granted in her own work.</p>

<p>This was an episode of Taken for Granted, but now the podcast is called ReThinking with Adam Grant, and it’s back with weekly episodes. You can listen to them right here in the WorkLife feed, or by following ReThinking with Adam Grant wherever you are right now. </p>]]>

      <title>How Science Can Fix Remote Work</title>

        <![CDATA[<p>Remote work was a trend that some companies and gig workers were trying out, even as others resisted. Then the pandemic made it an overnight reality for many of us. This feels like uncharted territory, but there’s already plenty of knowledge on how to do it well. Learn from someone who has done more remote work than almost anyone on the planet—and find out what science says about how to keep your teams cohesive, fight screenout, and build resilience by mentally traveling in time.</p>]]>

      <title>How to Love Criticism</title>

        <![CDATA[<p>What if you could tell your co-workers what you really think of them? At the world’s most successful hedge fund, everyone is rated and ranked constantly – in front of everyone. They’ve figured out how to embrace negative feedback, and they swear it’s essential to their success. Adam shows how you can learn to take criticism well – and get better at dishing it out. This episode is brought to you by Bonobos, Accenture, JPMorgan Chase &amp; Co., and Warby Parker.</p>
