Nusret Miami (No. 20-12422 (11th Cir. March 18, 2022)).<br /><br />Filed by a total of 24 tipped employees at Nusr-et, the class-action lawsuit alleged that from Nov. 1, 2017, through Jan. 18, 2019, the restaurant "paid them less than the required federal minimum and overtime wages and forced them to participate in an illegal tip pool with non-tipped employees." The plaintiffs' case argued that the 18% service charge should be treated as a tip.<br /><br />The 11th Circuit determined that the service charge was not a tip because it was mandatory; the payment was not a "gift" and the amount was not, as the legal definition of "tip" states, "determined solely by the customer."<br /><br />Make sure to check out all of our amazing podcasts here on Foodable Network!]]></itunes:summary><itunes:duration>1312</itunes:duration><itunes:keywords>doordash,florida-podcast,food-industry-podcast,hospitality-podcast,hospitality-recap,instacart,nusr-et,paul-barron,restaurant-industry-news,restaurant-industry-podcast,restaurant-management-podcast,restaurant-news,restaurant-news-podcast,restaurant-operations,restaurant-server,restaurant-weekly,south-florida-podcast,sweetgreen,tipping,weekly-wrap</itunes:keywords><itunes:explicit>clean</itunes:explicit><itunes:image href="https://d3wo5wojvuv7l.cloudfront.net/t_rss_itunes_square_1400/images.spreaker.com/original/f3bb99ae9de4d0c81d4bde880dcf00d5.jpg"/><itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType></item><item><title>199.

Presto over the years started building out a suite of products in three major areas, touch, vision, and voice which are all different ways of translating a physical action or physical event to digital data. Presto Voice is a human-like AI voice, an assistant to help manage labor shortage. Presto Vision, a smart AI-driven analytics to optimize your everyday restaurant operations, and Presto Touch, a guest facing technology. <br /><br />Barron asks Suri if off-premise including drive-thru, pick-up and curbside, how it is today is the new normal, he says, he thinks off-premise is underpriced and will see a higher cost over the next few years. As companies like Uber Eats and DoorDash costs go up and you will see a decline in the off-premise business. Suri says, “I think drive-thrus are going to do gangbusters everywhere, I don’t know if the world of people going back into dining rooms of restaurants that’s going to come all the way back because I think people have realized that drive-thrus are very convenient a lot of people are more addicted to that channel. The future looks very good.”<br /><br />Barron talks to Suri about what would be the technology that would immediately draw people back into the drive-thrus, Suri says, I think the drive-thru is set for a rocket transformation due to technology. Presto is working on a drive-thru experience where you can literally drive in and you don’t need to order or pay, you just pick up food. Presto’s computer vision cameras can recognize the person ordering, have your food order ready for you and send you a text message to confirm you are getting the same thing or if you would like to add or change your order. Suri adds that this can speed up the drive-thru process and make it a better experience.<br /><br />Labor is getting more expensive and technology is getting less expensive, Suri says. He adds, automation is the strongest it’s ever been today but it’s going to look like nothing compared to five to ten years from now. <br /><br />To hear more from Suri about innovation, the future of technology in foodservice, and virtual staff members, check out this episode of The Restaurant Report on Spotify.]]></description><guid isPermaLink="false">https://api.spreaker.com/episode/48576860</guid><pubDate>Fri, 04 Feb 2022 16:18:00 +0000</pubDate><enclosure url="https://dts.podtrac.com/redirect.mp3/api.spreaker.com/download/episode/48576860/the_restaurant_report_rajat_suri_presto.mp3" length="55567644" type="audio/mpeg"/><itunes:author>Foodable Network</itunes:author><itunes:subtitle>In today’s episode of The Restaurant Report, host Paul Barron chats with Rajat Suri, chief executive officer of Presto about the future of where technology is going in foodservice.

He adds, automation is the strongest it’s ever been today but it’s going to look like nothing compared to five to ten years from now. <br /><br />To hear more from Suri about innovation, the future of technology in foodservice, and virtual staff members, check out this episode of The Restaurant Report on Spotify.]]></itunes:summary><itunes:duration>2319</itunes:duration><itunes:keywords>ceo-interview,florida-podcast,food-industry-podcast,hospitality-podcast,hospitality-recap,paul-barron,presto,rajat-suri,restaurant-delivery,restaurant-industry-news,restaurant-industry-podcast,restaurant-management-podcast,restaurant-news,restaurant-news-podcast,restaurant-operations,restaurant-weekly,south-florida-podcast,weekly-restaurant-update,weekly-wrap</itunes:keywords><itunes:explicit>clean</itunes:explicit><itunes:image href="https://d3wo5wojvuv7l.cloudfront.net/t_rss_itunes_square_1400/images.spreaker.com/original/c6315abb7a3f499aeb491e16ab8e2e83.jpg"/><itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType></item><item><title>194.

The likelihood that we see widespread drone delivery by 2025 is now a real possibility.<br /><br />C-Stores may have been the old school grab and go's of the past, but soon they will be forced and poised to enter the serious fray of fast-casual as they face an entirely new population of electric cars that are about to change the landscape of the American roadways. Fuel stations could be a thing of the past by 2030 and see the birth of a new model for C-store applications.<br /><br />Chipotle is often referred to as the rule breaker and the one that seems to always be out in front. In my book the Chipotle Effect, I predicted what we would see a new reality of the digital restaurant which is now becoming evident. Chipotle continues to separate from the pack as they enter into a fully digital and Chipotlane model - that in my opinion puts them on a course to 10K location by 2030.

The QT system autonomously monitors prep and cooking processes in the kitchen, ensuring a seamless back-of-house experience.<br /><br />The Algo Dispatching system sits on top of a restaurant’s own infrastructure to ensure that food always arrives hot, fresh, and a perfect match to what the customer ordered. Algo simultaneously automates kitchen flow as well as the driver dispatch process.<br /><br />The goal for Dragontail is to eliminate as many manual operations as possible so as to ensure orders are delivered quickly, efficiently, and accurately. Third party systems are fully integrated into the platform.<br /><br />Tweetable Quotes:<br /><br />“[The QT system] is like putting a super manager in the store, making the most optimized decisions.” – Ido Levanon<br /><br />“We are the only company that managed to develop a camera that can watch what’s going on with the kitchen, connect to the point of sale, recognize what belongs to what, and guide the kitchen staff to the point where they make no mistakes.” – Ido Levanon<br /><br />“The ultimate [delivery] solution for any QSR where at least 20 percent of the business comes from delivery is to use a combination. Use your own drivers, but during peak times, use third-party drivers.” – Ido Levanon<br /><br />Industry veteran Paul Barron takes restaurant business insights to the next level.

The chain has been recognized as one of the top twenty fast casual brands to watch by Fast Casual Magazine.

Thanks to their success, Smokey Bones has continued building momentum for both of the brands.<br /><br />To simplify its processes, Smokey Bones uses the same tech backbone for all of its brands, using one operating system and one menu management system. The chain also ensures that all of its virtual brand products are easy for its kitchens to create and execute, but still appealing to customers.<br /><br />Tweetable Quotes:<br /><br />“Ghost kitchens and virtual brands give us the ability to increase our points of distribution in a very efficient way, especially in trade areas where we have restaurants.” – James O'Reilly<br /><br />“The key to success is to offer menu items that operationally and logistically have overlap with what you’re already good at doing.” – James O'Reilly<br /><br />“One of the biggest challenges is balancing the need to differentiate these brands with the need to keep them operationally as consistent as possible… we are constantly learning and adapting as we move forward, finding ways to make these brands easier to operate while protecting the incremental business that we’ve been experiencing.” – James O'Reilly<br /><br />Industry veteran Paul Barron takes restaurant business insights to the next level.

After a funding round in 2020, the California-based company valued at $4 billion. It may either file for an initial public offering in the next several months or merge with a Special Purpose Acquisition Company (SPAC). Impossible Foods has witnessed immense growth, with its products available in major fast food chains such as Burger King and Starbucks. It debuted its products through retail in 2019, and according to the Good Food Institute, the brand saw sales worth $7 billion in 2020. In 2018, Beyond Meat (BYND) became the first plant-based meat company to file for an IPO, which has a current market cap of $8.5 billion.

A former yoga teacher and holistic health coach, Merkle co-founded Box Greens in 2018 with business partner Cheryl Arnold. Box Greens offers urban South Florida access to hydroponic box farms filled with fresh leafy greens, herbs, and microgreens. Barron and Merkle explore the science behind hydroponic farming, the growing national interest in plant-based eating, and current adoption of agriculture technology in Florida.<br /><br />“A big part of our mission is using the business as a platform to talk about sustainable farming practices,” says Merkle. Restaurants and individual consumers who use local sources for ingredients can trust that there is minimal to “no impact on the environment from the transportation of the food.”<br /><br />Box Greens transforms old shipping containers into indoor hydroponic farms. Racks, an irrigation system, an HVAC system, and lighting are fully built into each container. No dirt is used—the plants are not placed in any soil, and absorb all necessary minerals from the water. Box Greens uses floating rafts to allow for a constant flow of recirculated water as farmers monitor the minerals and pH levels.<br /><br />On average, a functioning container can produce about 600 to 800 heads of lettuce per week all year round, and a 320 square foot hydroponic farm yields the same amount of produce as a traditional 1-2 acre farm.<br /><br />For Merkle, education is key. “One of [Florida’s] biggest economic industries is agriculture,” notes Merkle, “and it’s behind when it comes to adopting technology.” She has found that many people do not realize the lettuce they consume for lunch was likely harvested weeks ago in California, and has changed hands many times. “And in the process,” she adds, “it’s lost its nutritional value to a pretty serious degree, and flavor.”<br /><br />Plant-based diets, to Merkle, are the future. “Leafy greens have the highest concentration of vitamins and minerals,” says Merkle. “Food for a lot of people comes down to access—both in terms of physical accessibility and price point.” And hydroponic farming is “an incredible opportunity to turn people on to plant-based eating.”<br /><br />Check out the podcast above to learn more about how Box Greens began, using hydroponic farming with vegetables and fruits, and possible partnerships with local restaurants and research universities.

Having a compelling brand and consistent flavor is key. “People will drive as long as it’s a good product.”<br /><br />Calvo notes that her experience is uncommon to most female chefs because she owns her business. Many women struggle to rise and are quietly, but swiftly blacklisted from the industry if they have a family. Even those who do rise have to struggle with the gender pay gap and earn less than a man for the same work.<br /><br />“It’s a delicate dance, the restaurant industry,” says Calvo. “I was researching how many executive chefs are women in hotels. There’s a handful in America. They can’t go up the ladder. Men are at the top of the chain.”<br /><br />Calvo does not think the industry is without hope. “Roles are changing,” she notes.

As the founder and CEO of next-generation software platform Harri, Luke Fryer is dedicated to finding employee-facing solutions for labor-related challenges in the hospitality industry.]]></itunes:summary><itunes:duration>1614</itunes:duration><itunes:keywords>chowly,fourth,harri,hospitality,luke-fryer,nra,simon-bocca,sterling-douglass,technology-trends,the-barron-report</itunes:keywords><itunes:explicit>clean</itunes:explicit><itunes:image href="https://d3wo5wojvuv7l.cloudfront.net/t_rss_itunes_square_1400/images.spreaker.com/original/9ac1e21a500ffb76d6bc090908a86f05.jpg"/><itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType></item><item><title>57 How Seeds&amp;Chips Is Building A Platform For Food Innovation</title><link>https://www.spreaker.com/user/foodabletv/the-barron-report-seeds-chips-1</link><description><![CDATA[This podcast brought to you by Bench.co.

The beverage program at Tupelo Honey also speaks to the brand's commitment to improving the quality of casual dining chains. With kitchens that cook almost entirely from scratch, Chef Gabrynowics says transforming the beverage program to be more culinary-driven was not a far stretch to make.]]></itunes:summary><itunes:duration>1567</itunes:duration><itunes:keywords>casual,chef,cooking,dining,honey,hospitality,restaurant,scratch,southern,tupelo</itunes:keywords><itunes:explicit>clean</itunes:explicit><itunes:image href="https://d3wo5wojvuv7l.cloudfront.net/t_rss_itunes_square_1400/images.spreaker.com/original/dde4d73202f00a3fbfcc00f1ecbb4244.jpg"/><itunes:episodeType>full</itunes:episodeType></item><item><title>20 The Facebook Data Debacle</title><link>https://www.spreaker.com/user/foodabletv/facebook-data-debacle-review-1</link><description><![CDATA[Facebook has been dominating news headlines this week and for good reason.

Cambridge Analytica hired a professor to create a Facebook app that collected user data. You’ve seen those fun but useless personality quiz apps on Facebook, right? Right.

This was completely legal and in line with Facebook's guidelines in 2014. But when the professor sold the data to Cambridge Analytica, that’s when they violated the Facebook user agreement, which prohibited the sale of Facebook data to third party companies. Facebook removed the professor’s app and demanded that he and all third parties immediately destroy the data but up until now it is believed that Cambridge Analytica still has some or all of the data.<br /><br />The Impact on Restaurants<br />Now people across the globe are understandably upset.
