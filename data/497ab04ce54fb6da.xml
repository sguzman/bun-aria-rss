  <description><![CDATA[<div>This week Xi Jinping has taken his new Politburo Standing Committee on a group trip – to Yan’An, the base of Mao Zedong’s Communist revolution after the Long March. The symbolism is easy to see.<br>
<br>
On this episode of Chinese Whispers, Bill Bishop, author of the popular Sinocism newsletter, and Professor Victor Shih, author of <em>Coalitions of the Weak</em>, have returned to reflect on the Party Congress just past. It's been a more dramatic event than many (inside and outside the party) expected, starting with a brave, lone protestor hanging a 42-character banner off a popular bridge in Beijing, lambasting the authoritarian regime; and ending with the forcible removal of former general secretary Hu Jintao in front of the world's media.<br>
<br>
At the congress itself Xi overturned decades-long norms dictating the top leadership of the party – age no longer seems to necessitate retirement, while the Politburo has not a single woman. Above all, Xi has started his third term as general secretary with a loyal cabal of men around him. Did he not want more competent people in the top jobs? 'Loyalty is merit', Bill suggests.<br>
<br>
What does this mean for China, and the world? Victor makes the point that Xi is putting the pieces in place to push through unpopular decisions – for example, an invasion of Taiwan. 'If you think about it, why would you want people whom you trust absolutely to fill every single position? Because even Chairman Mao didn’t do this'. It also means that as Xi becomes more truly dictatorial, the West needs to engage with him more, not less. <br>
<br>

</div>
<blockquote>We just don’t know the kind of information about the US, about other countries, that are landing on Xi Jinping’s desk. And this information can be incredibly distorted. So if anything, just presenting an alternative view of how the world works could be helpful. He may not believe you… but if you’re able to look him in the eye and tell him something, at least he’ll be forced to think about it.</blockquote><div>As for the party itself, the three of us digest the Hu Jintao incident. Regardless of what you think happened, one thing is for sure – it was a deep and utter humiliation for Hu, especially given China's deep-set Confucian respect for elders. The idea that there is any organised CCP opposition against Xi has been put to bed.<br>
<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Alicia Kearns is the Conservative MP for Rutland and Melton; and the first female chair of the foreign affairs select committee. Alicia built a reputation as a foreign policy powerhouse working in communications and counter-terrorism for the civil service. After leaving, she spent some time in the private sector before deciding to become an MP. In 2019 she was elected in the Conservative safe seat, Rutland and Melton where she now lives with her family. <br>
<br>
On the podcast, Alicia talks about why she left the civil service and the time she ‘came out’ as a Conservative. She also shares her love for her Rutland and Melton, describing her constituents as ‘her people’. But makes no bones about how hard she finds the job: <em>‘I love being able to campaign and change policy. But I can’t say I enjoy the job’. </em>Now, as the chair of the foreign affairs select committee in Parliament, Alicia wants to improve the UK’s resilience in diplomacy and ensure Rishi Sunak won’t back away from Britain’s international responsibilities. <br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this week's podcast:<br>
<br>
We have a new prime minister, but is Rishi Sunak ready to take on the numerous problems that James Forsyth outlines in his cover piece for <em>The Spectator</em> this week? James is joined by writer and pollster Matt Goodwin to debate whether the Conservatives can turn it around in time for 2024 (00:50). <br>
<br>
Also this week:<br>
<br>
Is the future of feminism conservative?<br>
<br>
Louise Perry writes for the magazine this week that there has been a rightward shift in feminist thought, spearheaded by mothers coalescing online. She is joined by Victoria Smith, author of <em>Hags: The Demonisation of Middle-Aged Women</em> (15:30).<br>
<br>
And finally:<br>
<br>
<em>The Spectator's</em> diary editor James Heale and the <em>Sun's</em> political editor Harry Cole, are the authors of the new book <em>Out of the Blue: The Unexpected Rise and Rapid Fall of Liz Truss</em>. Now immortalised as a Twitter meme, they discuss the agony of rewrites and trying to keep pace with Truss's doomed premiership (28:09). <br>
<br>
Hosted by William Moore. <br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>My guest on this week's Book Club podcast is the Ukrainian novelist Andrey Kurkov – who has this year become one of the most articulate ambassadors to the West for the situation in his homeland. As a book of his recent writings, <em>Diary of an Invasion, </em>is published in English, he tells me about the experience of trading fiction for the "duty" of a public intellectual in wartime. As an ethnic Russian Ukrainian, he talks about what the West fails to understand about the profound differences between Russian and Ukrainian people, how their national literatures nourish and reflect these differences, how language itself has become one of the battlegrounds, and what Zelensky looked like to Ukrainians before he became a heroic war leader.      </div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>When Uber arrived in Britain ten years ago, the app transformed the way people move around cities. All of a sudden, at the click of a button, city dwellers could order a car for a competitive price which would arrive within minutes.<br>
<br>
To some policymakers, this hailed a new way of working and putting consumers first. Since then, a lot has changed. Uber came under strict regulatory obstacles and many more app-based competitors have entered the market. But the business has transformed with the times. Whilst emblematic of the gig economy, are the critics right about driver treatment? And does more regulation create barriers for the customer?<br>
<br>
Fraser Nelson, <em>The Spectator's</em> editor is joined on this special podcast by an Uber driver, Kasey to talk about her experience working with Uber; Andrew Brem, General Manager for Uber's UK business, Robert Colville, Sunday Times columnist and director of the Centre for Policy Studies; and Kirsty Innes who is the head of digital government at the Tony Blair Institute.<br>
<br>
<em>This podcast is kindly sponsored by Uber. </em>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>For this year's Midlands and Southwest Innovator of the Year Awards, the judges met four finalists at each region respectively. These eight finalists were shortlisted down from a record 176 applications. <br>
<br>
In Birmingham, the finalists in this podcast were MoM incubators, Hybrid Air Vehicles and Bambino Mio. The judges, Martin Vander Weyer, business editor of The Spectator met Steve Hewitt, non-executive director of Gymshark; Clive Bawden, COO of Warwick Music and former finalist of the Innovator of the Year Awards and Michelle White representing Investec.<br>
<br>
The judges faced the tough task of comparing businesses in very different sectors and stages of development. But all four made compelling pitches – and the variety of entries is part of the fun of these awards.<br>
<br>
We hope all the companies we meet gain from the networking opportunities, benefit from the accolade of being selected as finalists and enjoy the buzz, the conversation and the lunch.  We hope <em>Spectator</em> readers and podcast listeners also enjoy following the search for this year’s ultimate winners – and will take a few minutes to explore the finalists' websites and products. <br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this week's podcast: <br>
<br>
After the markets saw off Kwarteng, Trussonomics and now Truss herself, James Forsyth writes in <em>The Spectator </em>that the markets will be driving British politics for the foreseeable future. He is joined by Britain economics editor at the <em>Economist </em>Soumaya Keynes to discuss the institutions now dictating government policy (00:56).<br>
<br>
Also this week:<br>
<br>
Looking ahead to the American midterms next month, are we heading for a 'red wave'? Freddy Gray says in his piece for the magazine that the Democrats could be in for a shellacking come November. He is joined by Washington editor at Spectator World, Amber Athey (13:41).<br>
<br>
And finally:<br>
<br>
Should the Parthenon Marbles be returned to Athens?<br>
<br>
In <em>The Spectator</em> this week, Noel Malcolm says this age-old question is far from simple. He is joined by Lord Vaizey, chair of the new advisory board The Parthenon Project, to consider whether we can really justify keeping the Elgin Marbles in the British Museum (21:00). <br>
<br>
Hosted by William Moore. <br>
<br>
Produced by Oscar Edmondson. </div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>28 per cent of the world's fertiliser supply comes from Russia and Ukraine. Since war broke out in February, fertiliser prices have rocketed to record highs because of the disruption. British farmers are under pressure as the industry deals with higher energy costs at the same time; while consumers are facing higher food prices.<br>
<br>
Is there a way to reshore our fertiliser supply chain? CCm Technologies in Swindon thinks so – and reduce emissions at the same time. They say they can make high efficiency and low polluting fertiliser from organic waste, gathered from British farms, creating a completely self-sufficient production line.<br>
<br>
For their cutting edge science, CCm Technologies won the Spectator’s Innovator of the Year awards last year, beating dozens of Britain’s most brilliant start ups. In this tense geopolitical moment, Kate Andrews caught up with Pawel Kisielewski, CEO of CCm Technologies.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>I recently caught a rare viewing of a 2001 Chinese film, <em>Lan Yu</em>. It tells the story of two gay men falling in love and finding domestic life throughout the reform and opening years of China. The filmmakers never bothered to apply for approval from the censors, knowing that its homosexual storyline would never make it past the moralistic Communist censors.</div>
<br>
<div>On this episode, I take a look at the place of homosexuality in the traditional Chinese mindset and under these years of Communism. My guests are Zhang Yongning, the producer of <em>Lan Yu</em>, and Liu Yiling, a a writer covering Chinese society, technology and internet culture who has written about the the dating apps that millennial gay men now use. We discuss the homosexuality rooted in traditional Chinese literature, like <em>Dreams of the Red Chamber</em>, balanced against the Confucian need to procreate and pass on lineage. It turns out that, much like ancient Greece, the problem wasn’t so much the gay sex so long as you still set up families and had children, Yongning says.</div>
<br>
<div>With the influx of Christianity through missionaries, there took on a ‘pathological’ view of homosexuality, more akin to the western homophobia, says Yiling.</div>
<br>
<div>When it comes to political attitudes, Yiling makes the astute point that ‘Chinese history has always moved in patterns of <em>fang shou</em> (open and close)’. Under Communism, you might expect the kind of restrictive attitudes towards divergent lifestyles, but much of this had moved in more liberal ways since reform and opening, forming the backdrop to <em>Lan Yu</em>’s story. Yet the sticking point is always whether these minority groups ask for political or civil rights. Unlike feminists under the MeToo movement which has been shut down by the government, gays haven’t united politically. ‘If they start asking for rights, then they will be in huge trouble’, Yongning says.</div>
<br>
<div>We don’t get much time to talk about other LGBT communities, but I’ll certainly come back to those in future episodes.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>For the next round of <em>The Spectator’s</em> Economic Innovator of the Year Awards sponsored by Investec, we met in Leeds at the Dakota hotel and restaurant.  <br>
<br>
For the Yorkshire and Northeast region, three finalists joined us for lunch — out of a record total of 176 entries across the whole of the UK — to pitch their ventures to our distinguished panel of judges. The finalists you’ll hear about on this podcast are: Testcard, in the healthcare sector; MudDaddy, a portable dog shower and Tofooco. After lunch, we also met Powersheds via Zoom who couldn’t make it to the pitching lunch. </div>
<br>
<div>The judges were Gordon Black, venture capitalist and former manufacturer; Caroline Theobald, entrepreneur and chair of the Newcastle Business School at Northumbria University. Finally from our sponsors Investec; Dan Sheahan, Michelle White and Rowena Huston.  <br>
<br>
The judges faced the tough task of comparing businesses in very different sectors and stages of development. But all four made compelling pitches – and the variety of entries is part of the fun of these awards.<br>
<br>
We hope all the companies we meet gain from the networking opportunities, benefit from the accolade of being selected as finalists and enjoy the buzz, the conversation and the lunch.  We hope <em>Spectator</em> readers and podcast listeners also enjoy following the search for this year’s ultimate winners – and will take a few minutes to explore the finalists' websites and products. <br>
<br>
More Economic innovator of the Year Awards podcasts coming shortly!</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Fiona Hill is a seasoned political advisor, consultant and strategist. Born in Glasgow, she began her career as the first-ever female football reporter in Scotland. Then after moving into politics, she later became the first female chief of staff in No.10 under Theresa May. <br>
<br>
In her first interview since leaving Downing Street five years ago, Fiona Hill speaks to Katy Balls about how difficult she found it being attacked in the press after the Tories’ election disappointment in 2017. <em>‘Luckily I’m a strong person. But if I’d been a lesser person I may have thrown myself in the Thames.’ </em>She also reveals that in the month after the election, Hill came face to face with someone who had broken into her flat.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>The second regional podcast for <em>The Spectator’s</em> Economic Innovator of the Year Award sponsored by Investec was set in the picturesque city of Edinburgh where the judges and finalists met for lunch at the Dome on George Street. </div>
<br>
<div>We invited four finalists for the Scotland and Northern Ireland region — out of a record total of 176 across the whole of the UK — to pitch their ventures to our distinguished panel of judges. The finalists you’ll hear about on this podcast are: Cardinal Analytics a fintech business that predicts when enterprises are about to go bankrupt; MacRebur a novel invention for road surfacing; Roslin Technologies which make lab-grown meat; and Synaptec which work in manufacturing for fault sensors in power networks.  <br>
 <br>
 The judges were Merryn Somerset-Webb, editor and chief of MoneyWeek magazine and Financial Times columnist, Irene McAleese, co-founder and CEO of See.Sense, an early winner of these awards; finally our friends from Investec, Michelle White and Arlene Ewing.</div>
<br>
<div>The judges faced the tough task of comparing businesses in very different sectors and stages of development. But all four made compelling pitches – and the variety of entries is part of the fun of these awards.</div>
<br>
<div>We hope all the companies we meet gain from the networking opportunities, benefit from the accolade of being selected as finalists and enjoy the buzz, the conversation and the lunch.  We hope <em>Spectator</em> readers and podcast listeners also enjoy following the search for this year’s ultimate winners – and will take a few minutes to explore the finalists' websites and products. </div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>My guest on this week's podcast is best known as a stand-up comic, and co-host of the hit second world war podcast <em>We Have Ways of Making You Talk. </em>Now Al Murray has produced a book – <em>Command: How The Allies Learned To Win the Second World War</em> – in which he looks at the progress of the war through case studies of the men who, one way and another, made a difference to it. He tells me how we turned round a war we spent three years losing so badly, and along the way provides some sharp reassessments of (among other eminences) Orde Wingate, George Patton and the two-pound gun. </div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>This year’s regional podcast series for <em>The Spectator</em>’s Economic Innovator of the Year Awards kicked off with news of a fascinating lunch at The Ivy Cafe in Manchester. </div>
<br>
<div>We invited four finalists for the North West region — out of a record total of 176 across the whole of the UK — to pitch their ventures to our distinguished panel of judges. The finalists you’ll hear about on this podcast are: LoveRaw which makes vegan chocolate; Ordo which makes electric toothbrushes; Interact, which drives energy efficiency in data centres and IT systems; and Better2Know, which provides sexual health testing services.<br>
<br>
The judges were Gabriel Fysh, whose company Transcend Packaging, in South Wales, is one of our former winners in this region; private equity and venture capital investor Steve Morris; and Richard Greenhalgh and Michelle White representing our sponsor, the wealth manager and investment bank Investec. </div>
<br>
<div>The judges faced the tough task of comparing businesses in very different sectors and stages of development. But all four made compelling pitches —  and the variety of entries is part of the fun of these Awards.</div>
<br>
<div>We hope all the companies we meet gain from the networking opportunities, benefit from the accolade of being selected as finalists and enjoy the buzz, the conversation and the lunch.  We hope <em>Spectator</em> readers and podcast listeners also enjoy following the search for this year’s ultimate winners — and will take a few minutes to explore the finalists' websites and products.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>As the NHS turns 74, the service has never been under so much strain. The pandemic has created record waiting lists of almost seven million in England alone. Every month, tens of thousands of accident and emergency patients are left to wait for more than 12 hours with ambulances queuing up outside. Other long-term challenges such as an ageing population are coming to a head.<br>
 <br>
On this podcast, Isabel Hardman, <em>The Spectator’s</em>, assistant editor and her guests take a look back at the history of the NHS to talk about what the service was founded for, and why it is in crisis now. Isabel is joined by a panel of specialists; Alan Milburn, the former secretary of state for health from 1999 to 2003; Anne Milton, former minister for health from 2010-2015, and deputy chief whip for the Conservative party; and Philip Schwab, Abbvie’s regional director for government affairs in Europe. <br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>The UK was the first country in the world to begin its formal vaccine rollout, starting with the 91 year old Margaret Keenan. In the years since, the pandemic has been almost entirely routed in this country (though its impact on the economy, on healthcare, on the criminal justice system, continue to be suffered). But the British vaccine – developed by Oxford University and AstraZeneca – was a key part of the global fight against the pandemic. What was it like to be on the inside during those crucial first months? The Spectator has brought together politicians, advisors and scientists who played key roles during that time, to reveal a picture of dealing with unprecedented crisis in smart ways.<br>
<br>
On this episode: Kate Andrews, The Spectator's economics editor, talks to Nadhim Zahawi (Chancellor of the Duchy of Lancaster who had been the first Vaccines Minister during the pandemic); Jamie Njoku-Goodwin, head of UK Music who was a special advisor to then-Health Secretary Matt Hancock; Professor Andrew Pollard, chief investigator for the clinical trials of the Oxford-AstraZeneca vaccine; and Isabel Hardman, The Spectator's assistant editor.<br>
<br>
This episode is the first of a mini-series taking a look at Britain in the world, sponsored by the Bill and Melinda Gates Foundation.</div>

For the cover of the magazine Kate Andrews assesses the politics of panic, and the fallout of last week's so-called fiscal event. She is joined by Robert Colvile, director of the Centre for Policy Studies think tank to discuss where the Conservatives go from here (00:57).<br>

<br>
And finally:<br>
<br>
Are red kites magnificent or a menace?<br>
<br>
Paul Sargeanton says in his article for <em>The Spectator </em>that red kites should have never been reintroduced back into the UK. His claim is contested by naturalist and author of <em>The Red Kites Year,</em> Ian Carter (28:19).<br>

As Penguin reissues three of Josephine Tey’s classic <em>Golden Age</em> novels, I’m joined by Nicola Upson, whose own detective stories (most recently <em>Dear Little Corpses</em>) feature Tey as a central character. She tells me about the unique character of Tey’s writing, her discreet private life, and about how she made possible the psychological crime fiction that we read now.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In the last four decades, hundreds of millions of Chinese have moved into cities. Today, two thirds of the country live in urban areas (compared to just one third in 1985), and many of these are hubs with tens of millions of people – mega-cities that many in the West have never heard of before.<br>
<br>
What does this fast urbanisation do to communities and tradition? On this episode, Cindy Yu's guest Austin Williams (an architect turned journalist and academic) explains how these populations were thrown up into 'vertical living'. ‘If Ayn Rand had created a country, then China would be it’, says Austin. In other words, the family unit matters more than the community surrounding you.<br>
<br>
This episode is a deep dive into urban life in China. Austin and Cindy discuss the residential compounds that we in the West have seen so much of through reporting of China's lockdowns; the demolitions required to pave the way for this wave of urbanisation, which, sadly, left some towns disembowelled without rebuilding (see Austin's film <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=PL8ka3Ax4AM"><em>Edge Town</em></a> about one such settlement outside the city of Suzhou); and they debate whether it's a good thing that traditional Chinese aesthetics are returning to the country's modern architecture.<br>
<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Sam Leith's guest in this week’s Book Club is Ian McEwan – whose latest novel <em>Lessons</em> draws on his own biography to imagine an 'alternative life' for himself. He tells Sam about what drew him, in his late career, to using autobiography; about why there’s no contradiction in combining realism with metafiction; about the importance of sex; the rise of cancel culture – and why literary fiction by 'comfortable white men of a certain age' may have had its day, but he’s not complaining.</div>

  <title>Chinese Whispers: will Truss declare a genocide in Xinjiang?</title>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>After a long summer of hustings, Liz Truss has finally been confirmed today as the next leader of the Conservative party. As she gets the keys to Downing Street, she'll finally be able to carry out her vision of Sino-British relations. But what is that vision?<br>
<br>
On the latest Chinese Whispers, Cindy Yu speaks to Sam Hogg, editor of the must-read Beijing to Britain newsletter, about what we know about Truss's views on China so far. Will she declare a genocide in Xinjiang? What is an acceptable level of trade with Beijing?<br>
<br>
The difficulty for Truss is that she has never had to balance her opinions on China with the wider remit of government (for example, when it comes to the trading relationship that she lambasted her rival Rishi Sunak for pursuing, while at the Treasury). As Sam points out, taking the example of declaring a genocide in Xinjiang (something she has privately expressed support for): <br>
<br>

</div>
<blockquote>‘When you officially recognise that a genocide is taking place, that puts an onus on the country that has done so to try and actively stop that, using a variety of means (that could be sanctions for example). With that in mind, one can see why it’s a useful campaign pledge, but a difficult policy to carry out once in power’</blockquote><div>Then she might be held hostage by China hawks on the backbenches – those MPs like Iain Duncan Smith who have lent her his support, but may want to see her be as vocally sceptical of China in Downing Street as she has been so far. In that case, there could be a vibe similar to how the hardline Brexiteers held previous Conservative prime ministers to ransom on seeing through their visions. ‘She’s made a series of political contracts with various backbenchers about how hawkish she is going to be towards China. And each of these backbenchers will have a limited amount of patience’, Sam points out.<br>
<br>
We won't have long to find out as she gets her feet under the desk at No. 10 and, in a couple of months, meets with President Xi Jinping at the G20 summit in Indonesia.</div>

They discuss everything from his latest book <em>Quichotte</em>, to his relationship with his father, who we learn made up the surname 'Rushdie', and how he feels about <em>The Satanic Verses</em> now.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>What does China want with Xinjiang? Its systematic repression of the Uyghur people and other regional minorities has shocked the world, eliciting accusations of genocide from politicians and activists across the West. The Chinese Communist Party claims that its re-education camps are an anti-terrorism measure, but surely if anything is going to radicalise vast swathes of a non-Han population, it’s their forced internment and (for many) subsequent incarceration. So what is the CCP’s long term aim?</div>
<br>
<div>According to Raffaello Pantucci, senior associate fellow at the think tank Rusi, ‘the Central Government recognises that a very strong security crackdown is not necessarily going to deal with these problems in perpetuity’. Instead, ‘long-term stability for Xinjiang is going to come from economic prosperity’.</div>
<br>
<div>That’s where Central Asia comes in. On this episode, I talk to Raffaello about China’s relations with the five ‘Stans that sit cushioned between China (to their east) and Russia (to their north). As with China’s relationship with any developing region, Beijing is motivated by access to its significant oil and mineral resources. But there’s something special about Central Asia - Raffaello argues that it’s an extension of Beijing’s Xinjiang strategy: ‘It’s really about trying to improve the prosperity in this border region around Xinjiang to help improve its prosperity and stability… If you’re going to make Xinjiang economically prosperous, you’re going to have to find a way of connecting it to the world.’   </div>
<br>
<div>Raffaello’s new book is <em>Sinostan: China’s Inadvertent Empire</em>, based on a decade of travel in and around the region (there were two when they started, but Raffaello’s co-author, Alexandros Petersen, died in a Taliban attack in Kabul eight years ago). As well as the Xinjiang implications, <em>Sinostan</em> looks at China’s oil and gas trade with these resource-rich countries, the cultural exchanges (or lack thereof, and often promoted by Confucius Institutes) and the difference in approach between Moscow and Beijing, all of which we discuss on the episode.</div>
<br>
<div>On China’s usurpation of Russia in the region, it’s striking that some public opinion is deeply suspicious of the new power in the region, a general Sinophobia that crystallises in numerous conspiracy theories (for example that roads built by Chinese companies are specifically designed to the weight of Chinese tanks). Welcomed by governments keen to benefit from the economic clout of their neighbour, some Chinese companies end up trying to hide their presence to avoid the ire of the locals. Raffaello recounts that ‘there are some cities in Kazakhstan, particularly in the oil regions, where we know CNPC [China National Petroleum Corporation] is a big player, but we just couldn’t find evidence of them. You’d ask the locals “where are the CNPC guys” and they’d say “we don’t know what you’re talking about”’.</div>
<br>
<div>But China’s influence is very much there. It remains a ‘huge lacuna in Western strategic thinking’ that cannot be ignored, Raffaello says. Tune in to get ahead on this next geopolitical hot topic.<br>

  <description>My guest on this week's Book Club podcast is Rhodri Jeffreys-Jones – whose new book A Question of Standing: The History of the CIA looks at the real-life story behind one of the most mythologised agencies of American power. How does the world's first democratically answerable spy agency actually work? Were all those dirty tricks, extra-legal shenanigans and attempted assassinations – sorry: &quot;health adjustments&quot; in the lingo of Langley – really the work of an agency gone rogue? Did the CIA fail to foresee the fall of the Berlin Wall, the Iranian Revolution, the Arab Spring and the Twin Towers – or has it been made to take the fall for political ineptitude? And what is its standing now? </description>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In this week's Book Club podcast, I'm joined by Andrea Wulf to talk about the birth of Romanticism at the end of the 18th century. Her new book <em>Magnificent Rebels</em> tells the story of the "Jena set" – a staggering assemblage of the superstars of German literature and philosophy who gathered in a small town and collectively came up with a whole new way of looking at the world. Goethe, Schiller, Fichte, Schelling, Novalis, the Schlegel brothers, the von Humboldt brothers – and their brilliant and daring wives and lovers... their intellectual fireworks were matched by a tangle of literary feuds and hair-raising sexual complications. Here's a piece of the jigsaw of intellectual history that most British people will only vaguely know of if at all – and it's fascinating.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>It’s estimated that the average age of a British farmer is 59. This raises questions about the future of British farming. Are young people just not interested?<br>
<br>
On this episode, <em>The Spectator’s</em> economics editor, Kate Andrews takes a look at the next few decades for British farming. Young farmers are part of the picture, but we’ll also be discussing the role played by immigration especially post Brexit. The agricultural pressures and questions around self-sufficiency given the war in Ukraine. And how to balance all of this with greater concern for climate change. Kate Andrews is joined by George Eustice, the Secretary of State for DEFRA, Tom Bradshaw, deputy president of the Farmers’ Union and Beth Hart, vice president for Supply Chain and Brand Trust at McDonald’s.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Katy Balls,<em> The Spectator</em>’s deputy political editor, speaks to Freddy Gray, our deputy editor, about the FBI raid of Donald Trump’s Mar-a-Lago residence:<br>
<br>
‘There’s some desperation to get Trump. It’s self-defeating because it justifies his narrative that the “deep state” is out to get him.’ – Freddy Gray<br>

On the rest of the show, our political editor James Forsyth and the American Enterprise Institute’s Elisabeth Braw, an expert on resilience, discuss where our water industry went so wrong. Political journalists Patrick O’Flynn and Isabel Oakeshott give their takes on the Tory leadership contest.

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Nancy Pelosi’s controversial trip to Taiwan made headlines across the world this week, after President Xi’s warnings to the US ‘not to play with fire’. Furious, Beijing has responded with economic sanctions and a flurry of missiles over and around the island, as well as sanctioning Pelosi and her family. But as the West frets about possible escalation, often lacking from the discussion is what Taiwanese people actually think. In fact, as Taipei-based journalist Brian Hioe explains to Cindy Yu in this episode, most people there were less worried about the visit than you might expect. ‘There’s been so much in terms of Chinese military drilling or activity directed at Taiwan for a decade, people are quite used to it.’ <br>
<br>
Comparisons to the calm in Ukraine before the Russian invasion are unfounded: ‘we are not seeing troops massing’. That is not to say, though, that the situation is without danger. A more limited and realistic threat is of China imposing a blockade, or attacking one of Taiwan’s outlying islands. Other possible repercussions include a salvo of cyberattacks, one pro-China actor having already hacked supermarkets and train station displays on the island this week.<br>
<br>
So given all these dangers, why did Pelosi come at all? Perhaps telling is the Taiwanese government’s silence over whether it actually invited her. US domestic politics is probably a factor, as is her own legacy. Regardless of her motivation, President Biden said the move was unwise, and the situation remains delicate.<br>
<br>
Careful diplomatic management of the crisis requires reliable information. But in the context of Taiwan, that is by no means a given. Brian explains the bizarre dynamic that exists between international and Taiwanese media, where each assumes the other is better informed. ‘The two sides are actually somewhat bad at fact-checking each other. Then they’re just amplifying what is sometimes discrimination but primarily misinformation.’<br>
<br>
Tune in to hear more about the view from Taipei.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>My guest in this week’s Book Club podcast is the critic, novelist and art historian Chloë Ashby. In her new book <em>Colours of Art: The Story of Art in 80 Palettes</em> she takes a look at how the history of colour - how it was made, how much it cost, what it was understood to mean - has shaped the history of painting. She tells me about the age-old disagreement between the primacy of drawing and colour in composition, where Goethe and Gauguin butted heads with Newton, why Matisse was so excited by red, how Titian got blurry… and how the first female nude self-portrait was, astonishingly, as recent as 1906.</div>

  <title>Chinese Whispers: is China's property market about to go bust?</title>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>China’s property market accounts for something between 20 and 29 per cent of the country’s total GDP. The seemingly never-ending rise of residential blocks were how ordinary people like my family could see and touch China’s miraculous economic growth. Home ownership was to be expected, especially for young men looking to marry and start a family. Across the country, 70 per cent of household wealth is held in real estate.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>But in recent months, China's property hasn’t been so hot. The sector has shrunk 7 per cent year on year. Developers have run out of money to complete complexes that they've already sold; while consumers across dozens of cities are refusing to pay their mortgages in protest.  'The thing about real estate is that it's intensely pro-cyclical – everything that's good feeds on itself in the boom, and everything that's bad feeds on itself in the downturn', the economist George Magnus tells me in this episode of Chinese Whispers. He's the author of  <em>Red Flags: Why Xi's China is in Jeopardy</em> and has been warning about the underlying problems in China's economy for years.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>Also on the podcast is Lulu Chen, a Bloomberg journalist reporting on real estate trends in Asia. She was one of the first to break the story of the mortgage protests.  The picture they paint is one of a long overdue bust in the cycle.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>Back in the 90s when the country was fresh out of communism, most housing was still allocated by the state or employers. Since then, market reforms allowed people to buy and sell their own places (China's home ownership rate is 95 per cent). The market became hotter and hotter, and the proliferation of new builds (in order to keep up with demand) meant that developers were selling homes before they'd even built them. Real estate companies ran on borrowed money.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>All good and well when the money was flowing. But in the last few years, the amount of corporate debt wracked up by this model concerned policymakers in Zhongnanhai, who then put forward the 'three red lines' stipulating debt controls on real estate companies. Evergrande was the first to trip, but since then, even companies thought to be in the green have fallen to an industry-wide contagion of fear and default. Then came the harsh and sudden lockdowns of zero Covid which added fuel to the fire as consumer confidence and earnings were destroyed.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>Tune in to hear about just how bad the situation is this time (as I suggest to George, haven't warnings sounded about China's property bubble for years now?) But remember, economic problems can quickly turn into political ones for a government that bargains for legitimacy from economic growth. I ask Lulu what the ramifications of a property bust that makes the middle class poorer could be. She sums up the stakes nicely:<br>
<br>

</div>
<blockquote>'[The Chinese] have this idea of the world and what it’s like. Life is always going upwards, and tomorrow is going to be better than yesterday. And that’s kind of the mentality of people born in the 70s, especially 80s, 90s... They’ve never experienced a full economic cycle… So it really changes their world view of what life is going to be like for them in the future. It really casts doubt on whether the economy and the future of the country is going to as they envisioned when they were growing up’</blockquote><div>That's why this moment is one to watch.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Until July 6, Victoria Atkins was the Minister of State for Refugees and Minister of State for Prisons and Probation. But as dozens of her colleagues quit in the wake of Rishi Sunak and Sajid Javid's resignations (which themselves followed No. 10's messy handling of the Chris Pincher affair), Atkins resigned too, writing that 'values such as integrity, decency, respect and professionalism' have ‘fractured’ under Boris Johnson's leadership.<br>
<br>
On this episode of Women With Balls, Katy Balls hits the rewind button with Atkins, taking us through the turbulent events of those few days. They discuss what it's like to resign from government while on a school run; unforced errors from No. 10 itself; and whether the Conservative party can properly heal after this divisive time.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>The Catholic Church is half way through a two-year consultation exercise that will culminate in a 'Synod on Synodality' in the Vatican next year.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>A synod on what? Don't worry if you're confused. No one in Rome seems to be able to define synodality, either. What will the world's bishops discuss? Probably not the figures revealing how many Catholics have taken part in this exercise, because they're acutely embarrassing. The English and Welsh bishops couldn't even get 10 per cent of Mass-goers to take part in a consultation process that many observers suspect has been shamelessly rigged by Pope Francis's bureaucrats. And in Belgium, a country where some six million people identify as Catholic, the number of participants is somewhere between 2,000 and 4,000.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>Damian Thompson's guest on this episode of Holy Smoke is Ed Condon, editor of the influential Pillar website. His judgment is as impartial as ever – but, make no mistake about it, we're looking at one of the most expensive and self-indulgent fiascos in recent Catholic history.<br>
<br>
Produced by Damian Thompson and Cindy Yu.</div>

She tells Sam why the story has been so shrouded in silence – there isn’t a memorial to Partition, she says, anywhere on earth – and yet how it has shaped the UK’s population and politics ever since, and she says why she believes it’s vital that empire and the end of empire be taught in every British school.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Semiconductors are the most important thing that you've never heard of. These little computer chips provide the processing power for everything from cars and iPhones, to unmanned drones and missiles. In Beijing's Made in China 2025 industrial strategy, through which China seeks to move up the value chain to become a high-tech superpower, semiconductor self-sufficiency was one of the targets. <br>
<br>

</div>
<div>Beijing is falling far behind on this target. MIC 2025 stated the aim of meeting 70 per cent of China's demand through domestic production by 2025, but, seven years on, it is only meeting 20 per cent of its domestic needs (by one estimate). The world's leading manufacturer of semiconductors is in fact in Taiwan. The Taiwanese Semiconductor Manufacturing Company dominates more than half the global market, and controls 90 per cent of the cutting edge 5 to 10 nanometre sector (in this industry, size matters; the smaller the chip, the better). Even American companies like Intel outsource a substantial amount of production to TSMC.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>A tech arms race is underway.  In order to control the supply of this small but vital component, China and the US are desperately funnelling money into their own national champions, whilst 'kneecapping' each other's efforts, as Nigel Inkster tells Cindy Yu on this episode. He's the former director of operations and intelligence at MI6 and author of <em> The Great Decoupling: China, America and the Struggle for Technological Supremacy</em>.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>They discuss Washington's relatively effective efforts on this front – from instituting export controls on western companies (not just American) that supply Chinese semiconductor companies, to pressurising TSMC to share its know-how worldwide (TSMC will open an Arizona branch in two years, thanks to pressure from President Trump). It's got wolf warrior and Foreign Ministry spokesperson Zhao Lijian hopping mad; he has accused the Americans of practising 'technological terrorism'.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>Yet America's approach could be instructive for the UK, where there's a live political question over the Chinese acquisition of Newport Wafer Fab, a relatively low-end semiconductor manufacturing site that is the subject of an ongoing national security review.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>Some in the West also fear that TSMC's success will lure China to invade Taiwan, while some in Taipei see the company as their 'silicon shield', Nigel says, as its accidental destruction (or at the hands of the Taiwanese or American governments) may deter China from an aggressive incursion.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>On the episode, Nigel and Cindy discuss all this and more (whether China is inherently less innovative, how painful and inevitable a tech arms race would be, and Nigel's reaction to MI5 and the FBI's recent joint warning about Chinese espionage).</div>

At its centre is the compelling figure of Harold Gillies – ace golfer, practical joker, and pioneer of the whole field of plastic surgery. Lindsey tells me about the extraordinary advances he made and the will and skill that drove them; and the poignant story of how victims of facial disfigurement were the invisible casualties of the conflict.  </div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>You probably wouldn’t expect to see the Cultural Revolution in Chinese films, or the Great Leap Forward, or the Tiananmen Square protests. But for a certain generation and a certain corner of the Chinese film industry, these were actually common themes to deal with. Their films weren’t always welcome to the censors, but they weren’t always banned, either. </div>
<br>
<div>Cindy Yu recently <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/the-closing-of-the-chinese-mind">wrote</a> a column for <em>The Spectator</em> on Chinese cinema, and the golden age it experienced just after the end of the Cultural Revolution. You’d be surprised at the amazing political – and social – subversiveness of directors like Chen Kaige and Zhang Yimou. On this episode, Cindy talks about that golden age and also about what has come after, where, depressingly, it’s now films like Wolf Warrior 2 that dominate the box office.</div>
<br>
<div>Joining her is Chris Berry, Professor of Film Studies at Kings College London who specialises in Chinese cinema. They talk about how their trauma of living through the Cultural Revolution drove the so-called 'Fifth Generation' directors; the bold portrayal of queer characters which got them into trouble with the censors; and how commercialisation has changed the landscape for Chinese directors who are now dictated by the box office. Pictured here is Leslie Cheung in Chen Kaige's <em>Farewell My Concubine</em>, where Cheung portrays a queer Beijing opera singer.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Women of menopausal age make up a tenth of the UK workforce (and a quarter of all working women). The symptoms of menopause can make work much harder, they include both physical and mental, from hot flushes and brain fog to insomnia. But at a time when many may be reaching the peak of their career, these symptoms can halt years of career progression. What’s more, the condition is stigmatised and little discussed.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Steps are being made to break this stigma. This year MPs introduced the first private member's bill on menopause and the government established a menopause task force. Employers are becoming ever more aware of things they could do to help these millions of women. What are the next steps?</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>To discuss this, Katy Balls is joined by Conservative MP Maria Caulfield, who’s also the minister for women’s health and co-chairs the government’s menopause taskforce; Jacqui Smith, a broadcaster and Home Secretary under Gordon Brown. She is also currently the chair of two NHS trusts. Finally, Michelle Blayney, chief culture and talent officer at Lloyds Banking Group.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>China's social credit system is notorious. This Black Mirror-esque network supposedly gives citizens a score, based on an opaque algorithm that feeds on data from each person's digital and physical lives. With one billion Chinese accessing the Internet and the growing prevalence of facial recognition, it means that their every move can be monitored – from whether they cross the road dangerously, to whether they play too many video games and buy too much junk food. Those with low scores have lower socio-economic status, and may not be able to board planes and trains, or send their children to school. It's all part of a Chinese Communist Party directive to further control and mould its citizens.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>Except it's not. Speak to any Chinese person and you'll quickly realise that their lives are not dictated by some score, with their every move monitored and live-feeding to some kind of governmental evaluation of their social worth. In fact, the western narrative of the social credit system has deviated so far from the situation on the ground that Chinese Internet users went viral <a href="https://twitter.com/manyapan/status/1327208138660077569?s=20&amp;amp;t=ouhprNpUl6vMhPWtQ0johw">mocking </a>western reporting on Weibo: '-278 points: Immediate execution'.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>Telling Cindy Yu this story on this episode of Chinese Whispers is Vincent Brussee, a researcher at the Mercator Institute for China Studies (Merics), who has recently released a detailed paper looking at what the social credit system really entails on the ground (Merics was part of the group of European organisations and individuals sanctioned by Beijing last year).<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>The reality of social credit is unfortunately much less exciting and sexy than you might fear. For one, the technology simply isn't there.  ' When the social credit system was envisioned, or when it was designed in the early 2000s, government files in China were still held in dusty drawers… In 2019 when I worked in China I still had to use a fax machine. That was the first time in my life that I ever saw a fax machine', Vincent says. The system is not linked with someone's digital data, but fundamentally only their interactions with the government (for example, permits and licences). Data that e-commerce and social media companies collect on their users, which must be extensive, are not connected with the government's own data (probably because of the CCP's growing suspicion of Chinese tech firms).<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>But more fundamentally, the social credit system is not just one system. 'It's more of an umbrella term', Jeremy Daum says. He is the senior research fellow at Yale Law School's Paul Tsai China Center, who also runs the blog <a href="https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/">China Law Translate</a> (which does what it says on the tin). Jeremy has spent years myth-busting the social credit system. He says that for some institutions, social credit is a financial record ('credit' as in 'credit card'); for others, it is a way of black-marking unscrupulous companies that in the past fell short of, say, food safety standards (a particularly sensitive topic in China, given the milk powder scandal). In fact, social credit often functionally works as a way of determining how trustworthy a company is, like a government-run Yelp or Trustpilot system (the Merics report found that most targets of are companies rather than individuals).<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>So how did reporters get the social credit story so wrong? In reality, though the social credit system itself is fairly boring, the way this narrative exploded and took hold is a cautionary tale for the West in our understanding of China. 'The western coverage of social credit has hardly been coverage of social credit at all. It is coverage of us, seen through a mirror of China', says Jeremy, arguing that it tapped into our deep fear of unbridled technology and surveillance. On the episode Cindy also speaks to Louise Matsakis, a freelance journalist covering tech and China, who was one of the first to point out the disparity in the social credit narrative and the reality on the ground. Together, they unpack what lessons there are for studying, understanding and reporting on China from this whole saga. <br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>John Connolly, <em>The Spectator</em>’s news editor, speaks to historian Anthony Seldon about whether Boris Johnson might resign: <br>
<br>
‘Why on earth would he want to carry on and have more of this humiliation? Why wouldn’t want to take the dignified path of saying: “I’m going to fall on my sword.”'<br>
<br>
On the rest of the show, <em>Spectator</em> contributor Owen Matthews and our <em>Wild Life</em> columnist Aidan Hartley discuss how far Putin is to blame for global food shortages, the Refugee Council’s Enver Solomon says the Home Office is in crisis, and sports journalist Neil Clark explains why, despite the danger, the Isle of Man TT should be celebrated, not banned.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Julie Bindel is a radical feminist, journalist and activist. Growing up in Darlington, she left school aged 15, and at 16 moved to Leeds in search of – in her own words – 'scary-sounding feminists'. In the 90s, she founded Justice For Women, a feminist campaigning organisation that supports, and advocates on behalf of, women who have fought back against or killed violent men. On the podcast, Julie talks about her upbringing in the North East, her fight in the gender ideology debate, and she shares her thoughts on Pretty Woman. <br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In this week’s Book Club podcast, I’m joined by the writer China Miéville to talk about his new book <em>A Spectre, Haunting: On The Communist Manifesto</em>. China makes the case for why this 1848 document deserves our attention in the 21st century, why even its critics would benefit from reading it more closely and sympathetically, and why - in his view - the gamble of a revolutionary abolition of capitalism is not only possible, but well worth taking.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In this week's Holy Smoke I offer some thoughts on the impressive and distinctive Christian faith of the Queen – impressive because it's so refreshingly direct compared to that of many of her politics-obsessed bishops, and distinctive because Elizabeth II is one of a dwindling band of Low Church but not Evangelical Anglicans whose favourite Sunday service is old-fashioned Matins. Questions of churchmanship aside, however, there is no doubting the intensity of her convictions, about which she has spoken with increasing candour and confidence in recent years. Will she turn out to be the United Kingdom's last robustly Christian monarch?</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>My guests in this week's Book Club podcast are Daniel Kahneman and Olivier Sibony, co-authors (with Cass R Sunstein) of <em>Noise: A Flaw In Human Judgment</em>. Augmenting the work on psychological bias that won Prof Kahneman a Nobel Prize, this investigation exposes a more invisible and often more impactful way in which human judgments go awry: the random-seeming variability which statisticians call noise. They tell me how it affects everything from business to academic life and the judicial system; and how we can detect it and minimise it. The answers to those questions, it turns out, are very hard for human beings (especially French ones) to accept...</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>All eyes are on the Communist leadership this year, as the months count down to autumn’s National Party Congress, where Xi Jinping may be crowned for a third term. But how much do we really know about the Party’s leadership? In particular, can we better understand them through looking at the experiences that they've had?<br>
<br>
Take Xi Jinping, who is what is known as a 'princeling' – his father was the Communist revolutionary Xi Zhongxun, one of the Party's early cadres. How did that upbringing impact him, and his faith in the Chinese Communist Party?<br>
<br>
Also consider the Cultural Revolution – the sixtysomethings on the Politburo Standing Committee would have been teenagers during that decade of turmoil. How did it form who they are as leaders today?</div>
<br>
<div>Joining Cindy Yu on the podcast is Professor Kerry Brown from Kings College London, whose latest book is <em>Xi: A Study in Power</em>, so very knowledgeable on the President himself; as well as Professor Steve Tsang, a historian at SOAS.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Frances Haugen is an American data scientist, most well known for her whistleblowing of Facebook's failures at controlling misinformation. Her insider knowledge allowed the <em>Wall Street Journal</em> to publish a series of exposés about the social media platform, which became known as 'The Facebook Files'. She has testified before the US Congress, the European Parliament and the British Parliament on online safety and Silicon Valley.<br>
<br>
On this episode, she talks to Katy Balls about first experiencing sexism in tech when she joined Google at her first job; the shocking reality of how Facebook's algorithm worsens civil strife across the world; and what she wants to see changed from the British government's Online Safety Bill, which Culture Secretary Nadine Dorries recently joined the series to talk about.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In this week's Book Club podcast, I'm talking to Wendy K Pirsig – widow of Robert M Pirsig, author of <em>Zen and the Art of Motorcycle Maintenance</em>, the bestselling book of philosophy of all time. Wendy tells me about her late husband's big idea – the "Metaphysics of Quality", as set out in a new collection of his writings, <em>On Quality, </em>which she has edited – how fame (and bereavement) changed him, and how he sought to undo years of dualism in the Western philosophical tradition by recourse to Eastern teachings and, of course, the odd monkey-wrench.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>It’s clear now that Vladimir Putin didn’t expect his army to perform quite so badly when invading Ukraine. As much as that is celebrated in much of the world, it will be a cause for concern – or at least a moment for learning – amongst Beijing’s military leaders. Because Russia has always been a heavy influence and source of strategy and equipment for China’s People’s Liberation Army, ever since the days of the Soviet Union. So could the PLA – which hasn’t been in active combat since Vietnam in 1979 – similarly flounder?<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>That's the burning question Cindy Yu and guests discuss in the latest episode of Chinese Whispers. Timothy R. Heath is an expert on the Chinese military at the American think tank, the RAND Corporation, and tells her that: 'A lot of the issues that we're seeing in the Russian military is going to be of high concern to the PLA because there's a very good chance the Chinese military could have some of the similar issues'.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>They also discuss the possibility of low morale when it comes to fighting an enemy who looks and speaks like you – as some Russian soldiers have found disconcerting in Ukraine. Could an invasion of Taiwan throw up similar problems? Tim argues that it could, and draws parallel with another event – the enlisting of the PLA for suppressing the Tiananmen Square protests in 1989. It was a decision that saw many soldiers (though not enough) refusing to obey orders. 'The experience of the PLA was such a shock for the military and the CCP that a decade later, the Chinese government took the PLA out of the job of suppressing domestic dissent.'<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>In fact, the lack of trust in its soldiers' loyalty is such that today's PLA is one of the only armies to offer a 'suicide pill', so says Professor Li Xiaobing, a Chinese military historian at the University of Central Oklahoma who served in the PLA himself. '20,000 Chinese soldiers were captured during the Korean war. After the war, 70 per cent of the Chinese POWs didn't want to go back to China, and they went to Taiwan. So that's really embarrassing for the Chinese government in the Cold War'.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>Tune in to this episode to hear more incredible insights about this most elusive yet important modern military force.</div>

Inflation is an issue affecting most of the world due to several external factors, but many critics of Biden say that his policies are worsening this crisis rather than fixing it. Is that the case?</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Kemi Badenoch is the MP for Saffron Walden and a minister in Michael Gove’s Levelling Up department.<br>
<br>
On entering parliament in 2017, Kemi was quickly pegged as one of the Conservative Party’s rising stars and an example of what she calls the “British Dream”, going from immigrant to parliamentarian in the space of one generation. After a career as a software engineer, she made her move into politics as a Conservative member of the London Assembly. Then beat Theresa May’s own special advisor to the ballot of Saffron Walden. <br>
<br>
On the podcast, Kemi talks about her childhood in Nigeria and the golden ticket that was her UK passport, hacking Harriet Harman and how her conservative views were formed.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Sam's guest in this week's Book Club podcast is the writer Simon Kuper, whose new book – <em>Chums: How a Tiny Caste of Oxford Tories Took Over the UK – </em>argues that to understand the social and psychological dynamics of our present government, you need to understand the Oxford University of the 1980s, where so many of those now in power first met. He argues that the PM's love of winging it was nurtured in the tutorial culture of his Balliol days, that the dynamics of Tory leadership contests are throwbacks to the Oxford Union, and that Brexit – the grand project of this generation – was at root a jobs-protection scheme for the old-fashioned ruling class. Can that be the whole story? He tells Sam why he thinks we need to decommission the UK's rhetoric industry and learn to be more like Germany.  </div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>China is often accused of breaking international rules and norms. Just last week at Mansion House, Foreign Secretary Liz Truss said: 'Countries must play by the rules. And that includes China'.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>So what are its transgressions, and what are its goals for the international system? My guests and I try to answer this question in this episode through looking at China's attitude to and involvement in international organisations, past and present. Professor Rana Mitter, a historian at the University of Oxford and author of <em> China's Good War</em> , points out that there's a fundamental difference in China's approach compared to, say, Russia. 'Russia perceives itself as, essentially, a country that is really at the end of its tether in terms of the international system. Whereas China still sees plenty of opportunities to grow and expand its status'.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>To that end, China is actually a member of dozens of international organisations, most notably – as we discuss in the episode – sitting on the United Nations Security Council, which gives it veto power on UN resolutions (though, Yu Jie, senior  research fellow at Chatham House, points out that China is most often found abstaining rather than vetoing). It wants a seat at the table,  but it also frequently accuses our existing set of international norms and rules as designed by the West. To begin with, then, China is seeking to rewrite the rules in its own favour – Jie gives the example of China's ongoing campaign to increase its voting share in the IMF, on the basis of its huge economy. 'It's not exactly overthrowing the existing international order wholesale, but choosing very carefully which parts China wants to change.'<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>This multilateral engagement has a historical basis. Nationalist China was keen to be seen as an equal and respected partner in the international community, and Rana points out – something I'd never thought of before – that China after the second world war 'was a very very unusual sort of state… Because it was the only state, pretty much, in Asia, that was essentially sovereign… Don’t forget that 1945 meant liberation for lots of European peoples, but for lots of Asian peoples – Indonesia, Vietnam, Malaya, wherever you want to name – they basically went back into European colonialism'. This (together with its then-alliance with the United States)  gave the Republic of China a front row seat in the creation of the United Nations and, before then, the League of Nations.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>It didn't take long for Communist China to start building links with the rest of the world, either. Mao  'had not spent decades fighting out in the caves and fields of China to simply become a plaything of Stalin’, Rana points out, making its multilateral relations outside of the alliance with the USSR vitally important. After it split with Moscow, and before the rapprochement with the US, the Sixties was a time of unwanted isolationism,  ' which is well within living memory of many of the top leaders', says Rana, adding more to its present day desire to have as much sway as possible in the world, which still comes through international organisations.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>Finally, my guests bust the myth – often propagated by Beijing – that China had no role in the writing of today's international laws, pointing out that Chinese and other non-western thinkers played a major role in the creation of the Universal Declaration of Human Rights . What's more, do western ideas have no place in guiding and governing China? After all, Karl Marx was certainly not Chinese, and that doesn't seem to bother his Chinese Communist believers.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In this week’s episode: Is Elon Musk heading for a clash with the British Government over free speech?</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Elon Musk is buying Twitter. But might the Tesla CEO be in for a battle he wasn’t expecting with the UK government? <em>Spectator</em> Editor Fraser Nelson writes about this potential clash in this week’s issue and he joins the podcast to expand on his thesis. (00:49)</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Also this week: Where is it ever ok to stare at someone? </div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>If you’ve been on the tube recently you might have spotted a rather startling sign. This poster warns passengers about intrusive staring on public transport, so as to protect women from feeling intimidated on their commute. But who, we ask, will speak up for those who love staring at people on public transport? The answer is Cosmo Landesman who defends his love of people watching in this week’s <em>Spectator</em>. He joins the podcast along with Emily Hill who also has written for us on how silly she thinks this policy is. (09:56)</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>And finally: Is getting a fringe a cry for help? </div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Martha Gill writes in this week’s <em>Spectator</em> on the subject of fringes. Why have they come to signify a difficult or traumatic phase in a woman’s life? She joins the podcast along with celebrity hairdresser Cristiano Basciu who has a defence of the fringe. (17:35)</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>The cost of living is rising, as is the cost of renting. Zoopla estimates that rents are rising at the fastest rate in 14 years, which means that the average rent in the UK is now over £1000 a month.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>This is partly a pandemic effect, especially in London as people return to offices. But Covid has also shaken people’s financial security - the Citizens Advice Bureau found that more than one in three renters felt insecure about their ability to stay in their tenancy during the pandemic. And women were disproportionately impacted - during the pandemic, mothers were more likely to be put on furlough or even lose their jobs.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Rising prices are not the only problem with the UK’s private rentals market - slow or unethical landlords, unsafe properties or short term tenancies are all problems faced by renters. What more can be done for the almost five million private renters in the UK? </div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Katy Balls, <em>The Spectator's</em> deputy political editor is joined by Nickie Aiken, the Conservative MP for Cities of London and Westminster; Karen Buck, the Labour MP for Westminster North, who is also the vice-chair for the All-Party Parliamentary Group on the private rental sector; and Esther Dijkstra, managing director of Intermediaries at Lloyds Banking Group, who are kindly sponsoring this podcast.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In this week’s episode: Is Boris going to limp on?<br>
<br>
In her cover piece this week, Katy Balls writes that although Boris Johnson believes he can survive the partygate scandal, he has some way to go until he is safe, while in his column, James Forsyth writes about why the Tories have a summer of discontent ahead of them. They both join the podcast to speculate on the Prime Minister’s future. (00:44)<br>
<br>
Also this week: Why is the Rwandan government taking our asylum seekers?<br>
<br>
We have heard the arguments behind the Home Office’s plan to send migrants to Rwanda. But why is Rwanda up for this arrangement? Michela Wrong, the author of <em>Do Not Disturb: The Story of a Political Murder</em> <em>and an African Regime Gone Bad</em>, explores this question in this week’s <em>Spectator </em>and she joins the podcast along with MP Andrew Mitchell. (14:50)<br>
<br>
And finally: Can AI take on the art world?<br>
<br>
Sean Thomas writes in this week’s magazine about how some AI programs appear to have become rather good at painting. But what does this mean for the future of art? He joins the podcast along with Lukas Noehrer the organiser of The Alan Turing Institute’s AI &amp; Arts group and Professor Stefano Ermon of Stanford whose research has made much of this technology possible.

  <description><![CDATA[<div>‘One Shanghai courier uses own 70,000 yuan to buy necessities for people’, one Weibo hashtag <a href="https://s.weibo.com/weibo?q=%23%E4%B8%8A%E6%B5%B7%E4%B8%80%E5%BF%AB%E9%80%92%E5%91%98%E8%87%AA%E6%8E%8F7%E4%B8%87%E5%85%83%E7%BB%99%E4%BA%BA%E4%B9%B0%E7%89%A9%E8%B5%84%23">trended</a> last week. Instead of being seen as a damning indictment on what the state’s strict lockdown has induced people to do, the courier was lauded as a community hero and the story promoted by the censored platform. These <em>kuaidi xiaoge</em> (‘delivery bros’) are most likely gig economy workers. The industry was already an integral part to the Chinese urbanite’s life before the pandemic, but Covid has consolidated that role, as low-paid and hardworking gig economy drivers literally became critical to the survival of millions.</div>
<br>
<div>The Chinese gig economy is in many ways more advanced. The services are more extensive (grocery shopping and even designated drivers – a stranger to drive your car home on drinking nights – have been the norm for years) and the algorithms are more ruthless (closely monitoring and continuously shaving off delivery times. ‘The pandemic really brought the plight of these workers into the mainstream consciousness for the first time’, Viola Rothschild, my guest on this episode, tells me.</div>
<br>
<div>She is a PhD candidate at Duke University, and one of the few people – academics and journalists alike – who have looked into the Chinese gig economy. I’ve known Viola for years – we first met when we read for a masters in contemporary Chinese studies together.</div>
<br>
<div>On the episode, we discuss what working conditions are like (she recommends <a href="https://chuangcn.org/2020/11/delivery-renwu-translation/">this article</a>), the interactions between the state and the private sector (the largest players in the field are Alibaba and Didi Chuxing, both companies that have been penalised by the Chinese government in recent years), and what the pandemic – and particularly the Shanghai lockdown – has done to workers. We discuss the government’s efforts to improve working environments, but Viola tells me:</div>
<br>
<blockquote>‘What workers get through unionisation is really about what the state wants to give them, if their goals align with the state’s at any given time in terms of pressuring these companies. This is especially thrown into clear relief when we see how the state treats workers who try to organise outside of this apparatus’</blockquote><br>
<div>By that, Viola is referring to the <em>kuaidi xiaoge</em> who’ve been arrested for organising their own unions – it’s still deeply ironic that the most successful purportedly Marxist state in the world today is deeply suspicious of workers creating their own unions.</div>
<br>
<div>But fundamentally, as I push back at Viola, the problem is not only the private companies or the communist state, but also the consumers who demand faster and cheaper services. In that, ‘I think that the Chinese gig economy has a tonne in common with its American and British, and worldwide, counterparts’, Viola says. I totally agree. </div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In this week’s episode: How are the people of both Russia and Ukraine processing the war?</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Our Russia correspondent Owen Matthews writes in this week’s <em>Spectator </em>that he has been stunned at how easily some of his Russian friends have accepted the Kremlin’s propaganda. He joins the podcast to explain why he thinks this is, followed by journalist and author of <em>This Is Not Propaganda</em>, Peter Pomerantsev, who has travelled to Kyiv to celebrate the festival of Passover. (00:48)</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Also this week: Is Rishi Sunak politically incompetent? </div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Until recently Rishi Sunak was once a favourite to succeed Boris Johnson, but this week his popularity plummeted to new lows. Our Deputy Political Editor Katy Balls writes about the Chancellor’s challenges in this week’s <em>Spectator</em> and she joins the podcast along with Chris Curtis from <em>Opinium Research</em> to talk about Rishi’s nightmare week. (20:20)</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>And finally: Why do so many of Africa’s leaders support Putin?</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Our wildlife correspondent, Aidan Hartley argues in this week’s <em>Spectator </em>that this is because many previously colonised nations still see the West as their old enemy and that the enemy of their enemy is their friend. Aidan joins us now. (31:40)</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In this week’s episode: Is Putin guilty of war crimes?</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>For this week’s cover piece, The Spectator’s Editor Fraser Nelson looks at the risks and rewards of labelling Vladimir Putin and Russian soldiers war criminals. He joins the podcast, followed by Michael Bryant, the author of A World History of War Crimes, who writes in the Spectator this week about what the limits put on acts of war in the past can teach us about atrocities committed today. (00:52)</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Also this week: Is Europe facing a political stand-off between progressives and populists? </div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>This week Hungarian Prime Minister Viktor Orban was elected for a fourth term in office with a large majority. While in France, Emmanuel Macron faces a much harder fight from Marine Le Pen than many expected. Paris-based author, Gavin Mortimer analyses the changing faultline in European politics in this week’s Spectator and joins the podcast along with journalist and author Tibor Fischer. (19:44)</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>And finally: Why are overpriced English kitchens so hot right now?</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>How much would you be willing to spend on your kitchen? The answer for some seems to be a lot. And the fashionable choice at the moment is faux traditional English. Writer and art critic, Laura Freeman explores this phenomenon in this week’s Spectator and she joins the podcast along with Stacey Sheppard, creator of the design blog The Design Sheppard.

  <description><![CDATA[<div>After defeat in the Second Opium War, Chinese intellectuals wracked their minds for how the Chinese nation can survive in the new industrialised world. It’s a topic that has been discussed on this podcast before – listeners may remember the <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/podcast/what-is-it-to-be-chinese-">episode with Bill Hayton</a>, author of <em>The Invention of China</em>, where we discussed the reformers and revolutionaries like Liang Qichao and Kang Youwei. But for some reformers, the problem with China wasn’t just feudal politics or Confucian staleness, but its ancient language.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>Spoken Chinese could be any of a vast number of regional dialects which were too often mutually unintelligible. Meanwhile, written Chinese was extremely complicated, not helping the rock bottom literacy rates of the common people (30 per cent for men and 2 per cent for women). Literary and official writing were also uniformly written in 'classical Chinese', a concise poetic form of the language which was not the way that people spoke (the vernacular). The difference can be thought of as the difference between Latin and English pre-Reformation. Of even more concern was the fact that Chinese wasn’t easily adaptable to the new communication technologies that were revolutionising the world at the time, like telegraphy and typewriters (above, a picture of a 1986 model of the Chinese typewriter). These western-invented methods were based on alphabetic languages – which Chinese simply isn't.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>Earlier this year, I <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/article/the-great-chinese-puzzle-how-to-adapt-the-language-to-modern-communication-technologies">reviewed</a> <em>Kingdom of Characters</em>, the new book from Jing Tsu, who is Professor of East Asian Languages and Literatures at Yale. Jing’s book is an excellent account of the efforts to simplify, modernise and adapt this ancient language from Chinese and westerners alike. She joins me on this episode to talk through all of the problems outlined briefly here, and how a series of reformers, politicians and linguists throughout the 20th century tried to resolve these problems – sometimes with solutions nothing short of extraordinary. Of her mission, Jing says: 'I wanted to put a western reader in the shoes of these adorable, curmudgeonly, hard to take but utterly human Chinese characters'.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>We discuss the different upbringings we had – me in the People's Republic of China and Jing in the Republic of China (Taiwan) – and how that impacts our relationship to the traditional and simplified versions of the Chinese script and how important that script is to the Chinese national identity. We talk about the incredible and often positive influence westerners had on this language revolution (a narrative to do with that century of humiliation I didn't hear much about in a traditional Chinese upbringing). And explore whether Chinese could ever be the <em>lingua franca </em>that English is. </div>

</div>
<div>Also this week: How many of Ukraine’s churches have been destroyed?<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>In this week’s issue, Christopher Howse writes poignantly on the destruction of Ukrainian churches and how Vladimir Putin, a man claiming to be a defender of Christianity is desperate to keep the images of destroyed holy sites out of the news. He joins the podcast along with the head of the Greek Orthodox Church in Great Britain, His Eminence Archbishop Nikitas Loulias. (11:26)<br>

<div>And, finally: 40 years on from the Falklands War, why are there still tensions over the islands?<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In this week's Book Club podcast, we ask: did the chroniclers of the early Church cover up evidence that the disciples and evangelists of Christ were as often women as men? Sam's guests are the scholars Helen Bond and Joan Taylor, authors of <em>Women Remembered: Jesus' Female Disciples</em>. They pick out the hints and clues that, they say, indicate that women were doing more than just cooking, mourning and anointing in first-century Judaea – despite the difficulties of keeping track of all those Marys and Salomes. </div>

She was once described as the most influential non-elected person in Downing Street and became one of Blair's closest confidantes. Acting as an alliance broker, Anji worked across businesses and the media, including Murdoch's empire.<br>
<br>
After decades by Blair's side, Anji moved to the private sector to take up various roles across industries from BP to the Royal College of Engineering. As Boris Johnson welcomes the new Anji Hunter of 10 Downing Street, Samatha Cohen, Anji reflects on what it takes to do her former job – you've got to have balls.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Taiwan is not Ukraine. But despite the very important differences in their situations, the Russian invasion can still shed much light on Taiwan's future. Even many Taiwanese think so – and have followed the developments closely, with solidarity marches held for Ukraine, protests at the Russian embassy and the Ukrainian flag lighting up Taiwanese buildings.<br>
<br>
On this episode of Chinese Whispers, my guests and I discuss the mainstream take on Ukraine (and also the not so mainstream – such as the view that America can't be relied upon, given it hasn't despatched troops to Ukraine). I'm joined by Brian Hioe, editor of <em>New Bloom</em>, an online magazine covering youth culture and politics in Taiwan, and Professor Kerry Brown from Kings College London, author of <em>The Trouble with Taiwan.</em><br>
<br>
We give a primer on Taiwanese politics – what does the thriving democracy look like? How are elections held, and what are the major political parties? We discuss how China – instead of particular social or economic issues – is the main political topic dividing the left and the right (the 'Greens' and the 'Blues'), and whether, with mainstream Taiwanese opinion becoming ever hawkish on China in the aftermath of the Hong Kong National Security Law, the more pro-China forces in Taiwanese politics, such as the Kuomintang, really have a future in the country (Kerry says: ‘I don’t think the KMT can be written off.')<br>
<br>
In a crowded continent, there are also other power-brokers. We talk about the influence of America, and where Japan – Taiwan's erstwhile coloniser – fits in with all this. There have been calls for Japan to be more heavily armed in order to deter a Chinese invasion. How would the Taiwanese feel about that? Brian tells me:<br>
<br>

</div>
<blockquote>‘Views of Japan differ sharply between the pan-green and the pan-blue camp. For the KMT, they remember a lot of the Sino-Japanese war and the crimes committed by the Japanese from that period. But for the pan-greens, who are sometimes descended from those that were in Taiwan for the Japanese colonial period, [remember] the period as a time of higher living standards and improved education, and in which Taiwan is being brought up as a colony rather than these political killings and mass violence, etc. They have a much more romanticised views of a Japanese colonial period.’</blockquote><div>In the end, economics may supersede politics. If President Tsai Ing-wen can't deliver on the economy given her tough stance on China (which is still Taiwan's biggest trading partner), then domestic politics may be in for another shakeup. As Kerry says: ‘It’s the issue that we all wrestle with. Their biggest economic partner is also their biggest security threat’.<br>
<br>

Formerly known as one of the Brexit Spartans, she talks on the podcast, about growing up surrounded by politics where she first laid the foundations for a career as a Conservative politician.<br>
<br>
As a young woman, she studied law in Cambridge, the US and in Europe where she could excel as a linguist. Since taking her role as Attorney General, she made history by rewriting the law to become the first female Cabinet Minister to take maternity leave - named Gabriella's Law after her daughter who is now one year old.</div>

Also this week: are commodity traders finding a moral compass?<br>
<br>
In the wake of colossal sanctions on Russia are commodity traders feeling pressured to look more critically at the people they buy from?

  <description><![CDATA[<div>The UK has recently lifted almost every Covid restriction and with that, thousands of commuters will return to their offices. Will those memories of delays, cancellations, costly tickets and overcrowding come back to haunt the commuter? Most of the problems are linked to the patchwork of Victorian infrastructure that has struggled to meet the demands of the modern-day passenger. <br>
<br>
With grandstanding projects like Hs2 dominating the headlines, is this the kind of investment that's best spent for the consumer? And with other issues on the rise, such as extreme weather conditions, inflation and flexible working patterns, how will the industry prepare itself?  <br>
<br>
Joining Kate Andrews for this Spectator Briefings podcast is writer, broadcaster and specialist in railways, Christian Wolmar, Caroline Donaldson who is the managing director of West Coast Partnership Development. Finally, Wendy Morton, the Rail Minister at the Department for Transport. <br>
<br>
This podcast is kindly sponsored by West Coast Partnership.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>During the pandemic, we spent more time online than ever before and this has seen a boom in online fraud. It's estimated that scam adverts have tricked 1 in 10 people on the biggest online platforms into paying for fake products. In 2020, almost 150,000 fraud cases were recorded with losses reported of up to £500 million.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>For the scammers, they will do anything to convince you to key in your card details and this problem has shown no sign of slowing down. The online safety bill is expected to pass Parliament in March 2022. As things stand, the government hasn't included online fraud as a type of harm when it comes to certain adverts. So could the online safety bill be an effective solution? <br>
<br>
To discuss this, Katy Balls is joined by Nicky Morgan, former Culture Secretary and chair of the Treasury Select Committee. Now a member of the House of Lords, Nicky is chairing a new inquiry into digital fraud. Also on the podcast is Lucy Powell, the Shadow Culture Secretary for Labour and Liz Ziegler who is the retail bank fraud and financial crime director at Lloyds Banking Group. <br>
<br>
This podcast is kindy sponsored by Lloyds Banking Group.</div>

Tom tells Sam how massacres in Kazakhstan connect to the City of London, how western legal frameworks struggle to cope with international crime, how international kidnapping can be perfectly legal, why Tony Blair helped launder the reputation of a blood-soaked dictator – and how the conflict in Ukraine is the new front line of an ongoing world war between kleptocracy and democracy.  </div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>This episode of Chinese Whispers is slightly different – instead of taking a look at a theme within China, Cindy and her guest see China through the eyes of the psychoanalyst Sigmund Freud. Professor Craig Clunas, chair of art history at Oxford University, has curated a new exhibition at London’s Freud Museum, which displays Freud’s collection of Chinese antiquities. On this episode, Cindy talks to Craig about what these pieces – jades and figurines – meant to Freud, especially in the context of 20th century Europe, where there was appreciation of Chinese art but, as they discuss, not quite the matching level of knowledge. They also chat about the reception of Freud’s theories in China, especially given the country’s turbulent intellectual history since the May Fourth Movement a hundred years ago. Craig sums up the love affair between Freud and China nicely:</div>
<br>
<div><em>‘Just like Freud is using his Chinese things to think with, Chinese thinkers are using Freud to think with.’</em></div>
<br>
<div>The exhibition itself is small but fascinating, and runs until 26 June.</div>
<br>

<div>In response to Russia’s invasion, Germany has abandoned its Nord Stream 2 pipeline, sent lethal weapons to Ukraine and, most strikingly of all, has committed to the Nato target of spending 2 per cent of GDP on defence - a €100 billion fund. James Forsyth, who writes about Germany’s new reality in this week’s magazine, joins the podcast along with Stefanie Bolzen, a journalist for Welt. (17:18)</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>And finally: Are traditional British brands losing their soul?</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Harry Wallop, in this week’s Spectator, wonders why some of Britain's oldest and most distinctive brands are trashing their reputation. They are selling out, changing the very thing that made them special in order to appeal to foreign millionaires. He joins the podcast along with a popular culture expert. Nick Ede.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this week’s episode of Marshall Matters, Winston speaks with Russian author, journalist and culture and music historian Artemy Troitsky. Troitsky has had a long history of being anti-establishment. In the 80s he was blacklisted by the Soviet Union. But it wasn’t until Putin's rule that he felt he finally had to leave his motherland. We discuss the current conflict, Putin and the mindset of Russians today.</div>

</div>
<div>For this week’s cover story, Niall Ferguson writes about how Putin seems to be trying to recreate the Russia of the Past, while this week's diary by Timothy Garton Ash says the West has misunderstood his intentions, Niall and Timothy join the podcast along with Mary Dejevsky a columnist for the Independent.

<div><br>
</div>
<div>Also this week: Should there be women-only spaces on trains?</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Jeremy Corbyn suggested it when he was Labour party leader and now Scotland seems to be flirting with the idea. Mary Wakefield says in this week’s Spectator that although she enjoys the idea of lady carriage, it doesn’t make much sense. She joins the podcast along with women's rights activist Kelly Given, one of Young Women’s Movement Scotland, 30 under 30. (15:15)</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>And finally: Should we all get naked?</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Cosmo Landesman believes that once men reach a certain age, they quite enjoy taking their clothes off no matter where. He has written about his theory in this week’s magazine and he joins the podcast along with Andrew Welch from British Naturism. (23:31)</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In this week's Book Club podcast, we're going back 100 years to 1922 – the year which is usually seen as heralding the birth of literary Modernism. Sam's guests are Richard Davenport-Hines, author of <em>A Night At The Majestic: Proust and the Great Modernist Dinner Party</em>, and the scholar and critic Merve Emre, who has worked extensively on Joyce and Woolf. Sam asked them how much Modernism really did represent a break with the past, and how much it looked like a coherent movement at the time. Along the way we learn what Proust and Joyce found to discuss when they met, why Virginia Woolf was so rude about <em>Ulysses</em>, and what the mainstream story of Modernism left out...   </div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>China’s population is ageing. It’s estimated that a quarter of Chinese people will be elderly within three decades. The relaxing of its one child policy – first to two children in 2016 and then to three last year – hasn’t stimulated fertility rate, which is still stagnant at 1.7 births per woman. In November last year, nappy producers supposedly pivoted their marketing towards elderly clients over parents of babies.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>Demographers and economists warn about the problems that an ageing – and eventually shrinking – population will cause, in China and elsewhere. On this episode, I speak to the demographer Wang Feng, Professor of Sociology at University of California, Irvine, about what awaits China. For Professor Wang, care of the elderly will soon become an issue, with more than 365 million over 65s expected by 2050. The Chinese welfare state is minimal (ironic given its socialist pretensions), something of a ‘postcode lottery’, I put to Professor Wang. He says that ‘China has already missed the time window for establishing an equitable national social security system’ – it has already become too expensive, too fast. <br>
<br>

</div>
<div>We also discuss the one child policy at length – its logic at the time, whether Communist leaders foresaw the problems it would cause for their successors and, fascinatingly, whether there was any opposition within the Chinese Communist Party to the policy (the answer is yes ­– and if you caught my episode on the legacy of Deng Xiaoping, you will not be surprised to learn that the resistance was led by Hu Yaobang and Zhao Ziyang). Professor Wang points out that one of the reasons why the policy took so long to go even as China liberalised relatively in the 1990s and 2000s, under the helm of Jiang Zemin and Hu Jintao:<br>
<br>

</div>
<blockquote>‘They were people who grew up, like myself, at the end of the Cultural Revolution. Their knowledge of population was all learned from the time when China implemented the one child policy, when there was so much propaganda about how population would be the root of all problems for China. I think that generation of leaders were deeply intoxicated by these teachings’</blockquote><div>In a way, there’s poetic justice for a government who thought that, in Professor Wang’s words, ‘you can just plan [births] and constrain them as you would grow trees or wheat’. Today’s China, regardless of the loosening of the one child policy (to two in 2016; and three last year, which I wrote about at the time), is just not having babies. For the Professor, there’s a fundamental truth: ‘The ageing society is not something that China, or any other country, can reverse’. The crux lies in how to adapt society to be better prepared – fixing the welfare state, the healthcare system, and maturing the financial system so the ageing population can invest for retirement.<br>
<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In this week’s episode: What is the next act in Putin’s theatre of war?</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>For this week’s cover story, James Forsyth writes about Putin’s dangerous dramatics on the Russian-Ukrainian border and where they might lead. James joins the podcast along with Paul Wood, who writes in this week’s magazine that Putin’s bluff may be backfiring. (00:49)</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Also this week: How important is gallows humour?</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>The BBC’s new comedy-drama, This Is Going To Hurt, based on the best-selling book of the same title by trainee doctor turned comedian Adam Kay depicts some truly gut-wrenching scenes with a touch of gallows humour. This week in The Spectator, Andrew Watts writes a defence of making dark jokes in serious situations as not only a stress relief exercise, but a genuine necessity for getting through the day. He joins the podcast along with Ed Patrick, a comedian and NHS anaesthetist whose new book <a href="https://www.amazon.co.uk/dp/1914240200">Catch Your Breath</a> about working in the NHS during the pandemic is out now. (16:05)</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>And finally: why have we stopped whistling?</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Whistling can be seen as a bit annoying at best and rude at worst. But in this week’s Spectator, Steve Morris laments the loss of everyday whistling. He considers it a way of bringing music into one’s life for those who don’t own a piano. He joins the podcast along with whistling world champion <a href="https://davidmorris-whistler.com/contact/">David Morris</a>, who has released six albums of his whistling. (25:50)</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In this week’s episode: What’s the mood like in Boris’s bunker?</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>For this week’s cover story, James Forsyth writes about the defensive bunker mentality inside No. 10 and the PM’s strategy of keeping MPs sweet to hold back a no confidence vote. James joins the podcast along with Spectator Editor Fraser Nelson to discuss.  (00:50)</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Also this week: Have we forgotten how to take a joke?</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Jimmy Carr has caused an online outcry after an off-colour joke from his new show, His Dark Material was clipped and posted without context on social media. Ministers, such as Nadine Dorries and Sajid Javid, have now criticised a comedian for telling a joke. In the Spectator this week both in print and online, two of our writers came to Carr’s defence. The Spectator’s associate editor Douglas Murray joins the podcast, along with Sam Holmes, who is The Spectator’s Podcast Producer by day, and a stand up comedian by night. (11:38)</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>And finally: Has Covid permanently changed how people take Communion?<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>During the Covid pandemic, churches had to rethink the way they gave communion to their congregations. But will we ever go back to the old normal? Ysenda Maxtone Graham mourns the loss of the tradition of the communal cup in this week's Spectator. She joins the podcast along with Revd Dr Andrew Atherstone, a Tutor in Church History at Wycliffe Hall, Oxford, who has written a study entitled, Drink This, All of You’: Individual Cups at Holy Communion.<em> </em>(21:42)</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In 2008, President George Bush was the star guest at Beijing’s opening ceremony. Fourteen years later, under a cloud of diplomatic boycotts led by the US, the guest of honour spot was filled instead by President Putin. Under a confluence of factors over the last decade, China and Russia are closer now than they have been since the Cold War.</div>
<br>
<div>On this episode of Chinese Whispers, Cindy Yu talks to Alexander Gabuev, a senior fellow at the Carnegie Moscow Center, about how this situation came about. If the beginning of the end of the Cold War can be traced back to the Sino-Soviet split – allowing a bipolar world to be split into three when China began rapprochement with Nixon’s America – then what does today’s alliance mean at this moment in geopolitics?</div>
<br>
<div>For Alex, there were three reasons why China and Russia have got closer. China’s hunger for oil and gas makes Russia a much-needed new trading partner (and vice versa). The two were able to fudge territorial disputes along the 3000 mile border they share (Alex points out that Russia has only been able to amass troops on the Ukrainian border because their military presence on the Sino-Russian border is the lightest it has been for a century). They share similar political cultures - strongman-ship supported by powerful and corrupt oligarchs and a nationalistic society - and similar national leaders (‘for the first time after the dissolution of the Soviet Union, we have two leaders that are age mates and soul mates’).</div>
<br>
<div>‘The secret sauce’ that binds the collaboration together, according to Alex, is the US’s increasing confrontation with both. What we see from Washington today is a reverse Kissinger - where the two authoritarian countries are being pushed closer together by an increasingly hawkish America. Take Nord Stream 2 - any weaning off of the German market from Russian gas will simply make the Chinese market even more important for Moscow. But it’s not clear that the West has many alternatives.</div>
<br>
<div>Getting closer to China is not necessarily a good thing for Russia, either. For one, the relationship is unbalanced. In a reversal of Cold War dynamics, the size of China’s high value economy today means that Chinese business matters more to Moscow than Russian to Beijing. ‘Ten, fifteen years down the road,’ Alex says, ‘China will have more leverage’. Could a more powerful China try to bully its weaker ally in commercial and security spheres? Possibly, but the die may already have been cast: ‘unfortunately, the sources of grievances and conflict between Russia and the US run so deep [that] the Russian leadership is so emotionally invested that there is no easy way out.’</div>
<br>
<div>On this episode Cindy and Alex also discuss the malleability of national memory (Russian aggression during the 19th century often flies under the radar of Chinese nationalists), in what ways China’s relations with the US are still better than with Russia and exactly how China could react to any transgression on the Ukrainian border. Tune in.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Sam's guest in this week's Book Club podcast is Philip Oltermann, whose new book <em>The Stasi Poetry Circle: The Creative Writing Class that Tried to Win the Cold War</em>, unearths one of the most unexpected corners of East German history. At the height of the Cold War, members of the GDR's notorious secret police got together regularly to workshop their poems. Was this a surveillance exercise, a training module for propagandists – or something stranger than either? And were their poems any good? Philip tells me about why poetry was such a big deal in the Eastern Bloc, how – had Petrarch but known – the sonnet was the perfect model for dialectical materialism, and where those poets are now...</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>All political parties have weaknesses for jargon and buzzwords, and the Chinese Communist Party more than most. It's why Party documents – whether they be speeches, Resolutions or reports – can be hard going. Sentences like the following (from the Resolution adopted at the Sixth Plenum) abound:</div>
<br>
<blockquote>‘All Party members should uphold historical materialism and adopt a rational outlook on the Party’s history.’<br>
<br>
‘We need to strengthen our consciousness of the need to maintain political integrity, think in big-picture terms, follow the leadership core, and keep in alignment with the central Party leadership’</blockquote><br>
<div>In other words, full of platitudes and dense Marxist terminology.</div>
<br>
<div>So what is, then, the purpose of official Party documents? Can they ever reveal division within the Party, or say anything new at all? And throughout the fusty rhetoric, who is the audience, who are these words designed for?</div>
<br>
<div>On this episode, Cindy is joined by two guests expert at reading the Communist tea leaves. In this wide ranging – and slightly longer than usual – Chinese Whispers, they discuss the power of political language and how the Chinese Communist Party makes the most of it, why it’s important to control the historical narrative, and exactly what, if anything, does Xi Jinping Thought entail.</div>
<br>
<div>Her guests are Professor Rana Mitter, a historian of China at the University of Oxford and author of numerous books, the latest being <em>China’s Good War</em>;<em> </em>and Bill Bishop, who curates the newsletter Sinocism. Bill’s newsletter is a must-have round up of the most important political and economic China news, in your inbox four times a week. Very much worth every penny, and frequently featuring translated Party documents and Chinese articles.<br>
<br>
To continue the conversation, they also mention a couple of past episodes of Chinese Whispers:<br>
Cindy interviews the exiled Professor Sun Peidong about the witch hunt against her at a top Shanghai University: <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/podcast/healing-the-cancer-of-the-cultural-revolution">https://www.spectator.co.uk/podcast/healing-the-cancer-of-the-cultural-revolution</a>.<br>
Cindy discusses just why Taiwan is so important to China with Rana and analyst Jessica Drun: <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/podcast/healing-the-cancer-of-the-cultural-revolution">https://www.spectator.co.uk/podcast/why-does-china-care-about-taiwan-</a>.<br>

</div>
<div>In this week’s Spectator, our political editor James Forsyth and our deputy political editor Katy Balls report on the plot to oust the Prime Minister by Red Wall MPs, and No.10’s battle to save Boris. They join the podcast to give their up to date diagnosis.  (00:43)</div>

<div>Also this week: How to save the BBC?</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>This week Nadine Dorries announced that she is planning a licence fee freeze. In the Spectator this week Paul Wood, a veteran journalist of the BBC writes about his love-hate relationship with the broadcaster.

<div>And finally: Is it moral to do good with bad money? </div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>The Sackler family - whose fortune was built on getting thousands of Americans addicted to OxyContin, contributing to the country’s devastating opioid crisis - are now returning to philanthropy in the UK. But should their ill-gotten money be accepted for good causes? That’s the question Sam Leith and Matthew Parris have both asked for the Spectator’s website and magazine respectively.

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In this week's Book Club podcast, my guest is the gallerist James Birch - whose new book <em>Bacon In Moscow</em> describes how he achieved the seemingly impossible: taking an exhibition of Francis Bacon's work to Moscow in the late 1980s. James tells me how he negotiated between the volatile artist and the implacable Soviet bureaucracy with the help of a suave but menacing KGB middleman; and how, along the way, he nearly acquired an original Francis Bacon painting and nearly acquired a Russian wife. </div>

How did this arcane theoretical position escape from academia to become a social media talking point? What the hell is it anyway? What does Jeff Koons have to do with Foucault?

Stuart Jeffries - author of <em>Everything, All The Time, Everywhere: How We Became Postmodern </em>- puts it all in quotes for us.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>'If table tennis set the stage for China’s international diplomacy, then volleyball rebuilt the nation’s confidence', ran one article in the <em>People's Daily</em> around the time of the 2016 Rio Olympics. Sports has had a long political history in China, Cindy Yu's guest in this week's Chinese Whispers tells her. She is Dr Susan Brownell, Professor of Anthropology at the University of Missouri. She has been in and out of China since the 1980s, when she went to Peking University as a student and ended up represented the institution as a track runner.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>On this episode, Cindy finds out why exactly China cares about the Olympics just so much. And it certainly does – Susan and Cindy reminisce about 2008, when China spent $100 million on a four-hour long opening ceremony and $7 billion on the whole Games. Working in Beijing that year, Susan saw, firsthand, the excitement that local officials and people put into the preparations ('There were huge programmes to teach English to everybody, especially in Beijing. You know, the old ladies and the taxi drivers'), but also the fear and intensity that came with this – 'all the government officials involved in the effort were just kind of quaking'.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>The reason for all this – and the reason why a snub at the imminent Winter Olympics, as numerous countries around the world announce boycotts, will be remembered by China – is because sports has long been political. In the ping pong diplomacy of the 1970s, games played between Chinese and American teams allowed Nixon's America and Mao's China to get closer to each other. In the five women's volleyball team world victories of the 1980s, China was able to find a new source of national pride, as its people tried to recover from the wounds of the Cultural Revolution. In 2008, seven years after accession to the WTO and at a time when a more liberal China could still be imagined, the Summer Olympics provided a chance to show the world what 21st century China was all about. 'It was China's coming out party', Susan says.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>To be sure, this Olympics matters less – winter Olympics always do, and after all, China has 'already emerged as a superpower'. But even so, it will have a political dimension – just see how China eagerly invited President Putin last year. <br>
<br>

</div>
<div>On the episode, they also make a brief digression into the demolitions that happened in Beijing – leading to headlines in the <em>New York Times</em> like '<a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2006/07/12/world/asia/12beijing.html">Olympics Imperil Historic Beijing Neighborhood</a>'. Susan corrects media reports and says that, in fact, in the areas reconstructed for the Games, it was mainly small shops not residences that were destroyed. She befriended one man who was dislocated from his mechanical repair shop there and became a taxi driver because of the Olympics, and Cindy reflects on her memories of a 'demolition era', where China's rapid growth meant the words<em> chaiqian</em> (demolish and relocate) were commonly marked on old buildings across Chinese cities. But tune in to hear how some ingenious Chinese – including members of Cindy's family – welcomed the destruction of their property as it allowed them to game the system of government compensation.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In this week’s episode: Is it time to rip up the idea of vaccine passports? </div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>In <em>The Spectator</em>’s cover story this week, our economics editor Kate Andrews writes about her disdain for the idea of vaccine passports after being exposed to their flaws first hand. She joins the podcast along with Professor Julian Savulescu from the University of Oxford. (01:01)</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Also this week: Is Covid putting a spotlight on understudies?</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>In this week's <em>Spectator</em>, Sarah Crompton champions the understudy as one of the heroes of the pandemic. These are the community of stand-in actors who have kept productions alive during Covid. She is joined on the podcast by Chris Howell, understudy to Michael Ball in Hairspray last year and currently stand-in for Julian Clary at the Palladium, to discuss. (18:06)</div>
<div>  </div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>And finally: Is being cancelled a badge of honour?</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>The comedian Stewart Lee announced his pedal bin list for the new year. Essentially people he wants to put in the bin. In <em>The Spectator</em> this week Julie Burchill who is on the list writes about her excitement to be featured. Joining the podcast are two others who made the list: journalist Martha Gill and Winston Marshall formally of the band Mumford and Sons, but who this year is joining <em>The Spectator</em> family with his new show, Marshall Matters.

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Had Covid-19 not continued to dominate the headlines this year, there's little doubt that the outcomes of the Brexit deal would have been at the forefront of our policy discussions. Britain has left the EU with a bespoke trade agreement, but it's far from perfect, as the Northern Ireland Protocol continues to cause problems, especially for trade flow between Great Britain and Northern Ireland. What have digital solutions done so far to get closer to our goal of seamless trade? Has it been enough? What problems are still left to solve and do the realities of Brexit simply mean that we can now never fully escape these new regulatory burdens?<br>
<br>
To discuss, Kate Andrews is joined by Frank Dunsmuir, Head of Customs and International Trade Practice at Fujitsu; Stephen Kelly, Chief Executive of Manufacturing NI; and Shanker Singham, Chief Executive of Competere and an advisor to Fujitsu.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Pope Francis renewed his campaign against the Latin Mass this month, permitting his liturgy chief Archbishop Arthur Roche to issue all manner of threats to clergy celebrating the ancient liturgy. This 'clarification' has been greeted with horror by bishops around the world, including many who aren't keen on the old rite. <br>
<br>

</div>
<div>This episode of Holy Smoke puts this outrage in the context of what one distinguished priest calls the 'Wild West' of the Bergoglio pontificate. Never have I known such widespread despair among all but the most hardline liberal clergy. That this should be happening at Christmas underlines the grim unfairness of it all – and the desperate need for regime change in the Church. And if that means the Vatican as we know it ceases to exist, perhaps that isn't such a bad thing. </div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>What are the greener solutions for heating Britain's homes? The government estimates that heating residential homes accounts for around 15 per cent of the UK's greenhouse gas emissions. For this reason, many households are concerned about the future of their gas boilers and energy bills. The government laid out its heat and building strategy this October, but do their plans address these worries? And if heat pumps and hydrogen boilers are inevitable, can we find a fair way to achieve that green future, without unnecessarily burdening the poorest in society?<br>
<br>
Kate Andrews, <em>The Spectator</em>'s economics editor discusses all this with three experts in the field: Chris O'Shea, the chief executive officer at Centrica, Dr Tina Fawcett, the acting leader of the energy research team at the Environmental Change Institute at the University of Oxford, and the co-director of the Centre for Research Into Energy Demand, and Jacob Young, who is the MP for Redcar and chairs the All-Party Parliamentary Group for Hydrogen.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Everyone knows somebody who has asthma. 5.4 million people in the UK are currently receiving treatment and 200,000 of them have severe asthma. A form of the condition that doesn’t typically respond well to medication. For many, asthma is a severe and debilitating condition but there exists a disconnect between its severity and the organisation of resources to treat it. When it comes to treating an illness, remission is rarely black and white, but for asthma it's commonly steroids.<br>

<div>What if anything is the alternative? Steroids have become the frenemy of both patients and the healthcare system. On the one hand, they’re cheap to administer and largely effective. But on the other, the side effects they produce can be very difficult for patients and costly.<br>

<div>Joining Kate Andrews to discuss all this is Gabby Perry, who is a student and has severe asthma; Syed Ali, medical affairs manager at AstraZeneca; David Price, professor of primary respiratory medicine at the University of Aberdeen who's currently leading the first international severe asthma registry.<em><br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Welcome to the special Christmas episode of The Edition! </div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>In this episode, we look at five major topics that dominated the news this year and the pages of <em>The Spectator</em>. </div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>First up a review of the year in politics with our resident Coffee House Shot's team James Forsyth, Katy Balls and Isabel Hardman. We discuss how Boris seemed to make such a strong start to the year through the vaccine rollout, but squandered this goodwill with several own goals. We also touch on some of the big political moments of the year: Partygate, the Owen Paterson affair and of course Matt Hancock. (00:39)</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Next, we go global and look at three of the major powerhouses that took headlines this year. The EU, who ends the year in a panic over Russia, extreme Covid measures, and upcoming elections. The US started with an insurrection and ended with President Biden's plummeting poll numbers. Finally, China, who if you ask them say they are doing just fine. Lara Prendergast is joined by Jonathan Miller, Douglas Murray, and Cindy Yu to discuss the state of the world. (22:34)</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Then, a subject we all hoped to be leaving in the rearview mirror. Covid. With so much misinformation out there, the one important thing to have is good data, which is why we built <em>The Spectator</em>’s Covid data hub, and William Moore is joined on the podcast by three people who spend an ungodly amount of time going through those figures. <em>The Spectator</em> editor Fraser Nelson, Michael Simmons (who puts the data hub together and is making his podcast debut), and our economics editor Kate Andrews. (40:52)</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>We chose our penultimate segment by looking back at all the most read articles of the year and chose the subject that appeared the most. The Royal Family won by a landslide, and it has been a big year for them. To break down the year’s big Royal moments and try and figure out why we are so obsessed with this family, Lara Prendergast and William Moore sat down with Freddy Gray and Patrick Jephson. (59:37)</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>And finally, The Edition's producer has given William Moore an early Christmas present. The Church of England is one of his favourite things to talk about, because of how important he thinks it is for our society, but also because of the many issues he has with how it is run. Will gets stuck into it with four amazing priests – Marcus Walker, Daniel French, Nicholas Cranfield, and Steve Morris – who see out the year by telling us their favourite Christmas carols. (01:13:04)</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Hosted by Lara Prendergast &amp; Will Moore</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Produced by Sam Holmes</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Sam's guest in this week’s Book Club podcast is the writer Siri Hustvedt, whose latest book is a collection of essays: <em>Mothers, Fathers and Others</em>. She tells Sam what literary critics get wrong, why she has a rubber brain on her desk, how Ancient Greek misogyny is still with us, why the 17th-century Duchess of Newcastle has yet to get her due – and how long it took her to stop smiling politely when people said her husband wrote her books…</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>We've long known that where you live, who you live with, how you grow up, and how much money you have can have long lasting consequences for you health. Those that live in inner city neighbourhoods are far more exposed to health risks such as air pollution or drug abuse compared to leafy suburban residents.<br>
<br>
Does this connection between socioeconomic background and health fall on the responsibility of healthcare professionals and policymakers? Do nurses and doctors now also have to think about air pollution and green spaces? And is this holistic view of health helpful and indeed possible?<br>
<br>
In a special episode, Kate Andrews is joined by a panel of experts in this field. Charmaine Griffiths is the chief executive of the British Heart Foundation. Chinmay Bhatt is the managing director for the pharmaceutical company, Novartis in the UK and Ireland. And Sir Michael Marmot is a professor in epidemiology and public health at University College London.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>We've long known that where you live, who you live with, how you grew up and your quality of life can have long-lasting consequences for your health. Socioeconomic backgrounds are directly linked to healthcare outcomes. Those that live in inner-city neighbourhoods with dense populations and traffic are likely to have different health outcomes than residents living in leafy suburban London. But what does this mean for healthcare workers and policymakers? Do doctors now have to think about air pollution and green spaces to encourage a healthier population? is this holistic view of health helpful? Or indeed possible? <br>
<br>
Kate Andrews is joined by a panel of experts to tackle these questions. Charmaine Griffiths is head of the British Heart Foundation, Chinmay Bhatt who is the managing director of the pharmaceutical company, Novartis in the UK and Ireland. And Sir Michael Marmot whose been looking at this question in today's Britain. <br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>When the tennis star Peng Shuai had a row with her former lover, the retired Party cadre Zhang Gaoli, she took to Weibo, the Chinese social media platform, where she had half a million followers. It was in that statement that she accused Zhang of starting their affair with sexual assault.<br>
<br>
The statement was taken down within minutes, demonstrating the power, speed – and, arguably, the manual nature – of China’s online censors. On this podcast, we’ve previously talked about the nature of journalism in China – but what about social media, that inherently decentralised medium? What role does the digital space play in Chinese lives, how reliable is it as a source of Chinese public opinion, and how do people feel about being monitored and, potentially, censored?<br>
<br>
On the podcast, Cindy Yu speaks to Manya Koetse, the founder of <a href="http://whatsonweibo.com">whatsonweibo.com</a>, which collates and translates the latest trends and topics from the platform into English; as well as Shen Lu, a reporter for <em>Protocol</em> who covers China and tech.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>With Manya, they muse about what censorship does to a nation's online discussion: the focus turns to policy issues like health and safety standards, or more superficial discussions like pets and travel. Yet during the early days of the pandemic last year, we both witnessed an incredible night where, on Weibo, WeChat, and other platforms, Dr Li Wenliang's death prompted a universal outpouring of grief. Manya tells Cindy that:  ‘Dr Li was a story that was too big to censor... censoring all of those discussions would have actually caused more unrest’.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>Since the pandemic, the digital sphere has also become more nationalistic: <br>
<br>

<blockquote>'The Hong Kong protests definitely was the moment when I saw this new wave of nationalism online, which you’ve always had, but especially the last two years it’s been so clear. Covid-19 has only strengthened the wave that started back then’</blockquote><div>Cindy also speaks to Shen Lu, who tells her about her experience being censored on Weibo when reporting on China's MeToo movement. Censorship has only become worse in recent years – she says: ' I can no longer tell which friend is which, because we started to self-censor'. More optimistically though, Lu tells Cindy that all the same political conversations among liberal minded young Chinese are still happening – simply offline, these days.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>When the Glasgow climate jamboree ended after two weeks, COP26 President Alok Sharma broke down in tears and seemed to apologise for his failure to get countries like China and India on side. But now that the dust has settled from Glasgow's COP26 summit, but how will this one be remembered? There were protestors, no shows from state leaders and new commitments were made whilst backroom wrangling had mixed results.<br>
<br>
What are the key factors that make these summits a success? Given the mammoth task ahead of the countries that have committed to tacking climate change, is it realistic to expect real change?<br>
<br>
In this podcast, Cindy Yu is joined by seasoned professionals in climate change and sustainability. Harriet Lamb, CBE and CEO of Ashden which is an organisation that supports and promotes sustainable energy enterprises. Emily Thornberry MP who is shadow attorney general but was Labour's shadow international trade secretary at the time of recording this podcast. Finally, Simone Rossi, who is the CEO of EDF Energy.<br>
<br>
This podcast is kindly sponsored by EDF Energy.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In this week’s episode: Is there any substance to the government’s new drugs agenda?</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>In The Spectator this week Fraser Nelson writes the cover story on the government’s new 10 years drugs plan and finds that while on the surface this seems like a new war on drugs, it might actually have some thoughtful and effective policies buried within it. Fraser is joined on the podcast by Christopher Snowden, the head of lifestyle economics at the Institute of Economic Affairs. (00:52)</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Also this week: Can Islam save Britain’s churches?</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Britain has for a long time now has been becoming a more and more secular nation. This has meant that many churches that used to have full pews are at risk of turning into luxury flats or another Tesco Express. But in this week’s Spectator, Tanjil Rashid highlights another destiny for these buildings. Conversion into mosques. In the piece, he argues these buildings should continue being a place of faith even if that faith is not Christian. He joins Lara along with Christopher Howse, the author of many a book about religious history and architecture. (13:46)</div>
<div>  </div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>And finally: Are we witnessing the twilight of the necktie? </div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Lockdowns meant we all got used to working from home, which resulted in a much more casual dress code. It feels very strange to wear a suit around your own house. But Jonathan Miller is worried that this may lead to the end of the necktie, a fashion accessory he believes is an important symbol of traditional masculinity. He joins Lara to expand on that idea along with fashion historian Dr. Kimberly Chrisman-Campbell. (25:47)</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In this week’s episode: Is the current NHS crisis a bug or a feature?</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>In the Spectator’s cover story this week, our economics editor Kate Andrews writes about the state of the NHS and why even though reform is so clearly needed it's nearly politically impossible to try to do so. She joins the podcast with Isabel Hardman who is currently writing a book on the history of the NHS. (00:53)<br>
<br>

</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Also this week: How is the nation feeling about the Omicron variant?</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>The news of the Omicron variant has not only worried the public about what may become of their Christmas plans, but the government has also reacted by bringing in new travel restrictions and mask mandates. Two of our columnists Lionel Shriver and Rod Liddle have both given their views on the latest pandemic precautions in week’s magazine and on the podcast they continue those conversations. (16:25)</div>
<div>  </div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>And finally: Now it’s December can we open the Baileys?</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Now it’s December, Christmas celebrations can begin. Our own Hannah Tomes has written about one of her favourite festive delights. Baileys. She joins the podcast along with another Irish cream connoisseur, Lara Prendergast, and the Spectator’s Deputy Editor Freddy Gray who heard we were drinking Baileys and couldn’t resist.  (33:02)</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>This year Faber and Faber started the project of republishing the late Nobel Laureate William Golding's back catalogue -- starting with <em>Pincher Martin</em>, <em>The Inheritors </em>and <em>The Spire</em>. Sam is joined by his daughter Judy Golding -- author of <em>The Children of Lovers: A Memoir of William Golding By His Daughter</em>-- to talk about Golding the writer and Golding the man. What were the deep fears that drove his work and were eased by drink? How did the war change his worldview? And what was the nature of the religious sensibility that underpinned his visionary allegories of folly and evil?</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Sun Yat-sen was the founding father of China's first republic, when the Qing dynasty was overthrown. Here he sits, with his successor Chiang Kai-Shek standing behind. They were two among many intellectuals and politicians whose agitations helped contribute to modern Chinese national identity. In his book, <em>The Invention of China</em>, journalist Bill Hayton argues that this is where 'China' and the key parts that contribute to a modern Chinese identity - territorial claims, ethnicities, history and so on - were moulded into an 'imagined' nationalism.<br>
<br>
Cindy Yu interviews Bill in this episode, and they discuss everything from the contribution of foreign aggressors (especially Japan) to China's modern identity, to the ferocious intellectual debate about which ethnicities are 'Chinese' - just Han? Or Mongols, Manchurians, Tibetans and Uyghurs too? Plus - is any national identity around the world <em>not</em> constructed?</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In this week’s episode: Just who is protesting new Covid rules in Europe? </div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>In The Spectator this week we have three articles that cover the riots and protests all over Europe about new covid policies. Two of them report the scene on the ground in different countries. Lionel Barber and Nick Farrell write respectively about the situations in Holland and Italy and talk on the podcast about why this is happening now and how much more it could escalate. (00:45)<br>
<br>

</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Also this week: Is China having its own hand and the #MeToo moment?</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>A spotlight has been shined on China in recent days, due to the troubling series of events surrounding the Chinese tennis player Peng Shuai. Who after making claims of being pressured into a sexual relationship with a CCP official, disappeared for days, as all mentions of her claims were wiped from social media. Cindy Yu writes about this story in this week’s Spectator and talks on the podcast about the history of China’s mistress culture. (14:17)</div>
<div>  </div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>And finally: What does it take to be a Hamleys elf? </div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Christmas is coming and if there are children in your life begging for this season's hottest toy, you might find yourself at Hamleys, the world’s oldest toys store, and as you enter you may well be greeted by a festive elf. But what’s it like being one of these red and green-clad friends of Father Christmas? Our podcast producer Sam Holmes writes in The Spectator this week about his experience as an elf when he was 19. Sam is joined on the podcast by Mark Campbell, the current Lego man at Hamleys and Sam’s old boss from his elf days. (21:00)</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In this week’s episode: Are migrants the new munitions? </div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>In our cover story this week, our political editor James Forsyth looks at the growing troubles in Eastern Europe and how this small part of the world stage could end up splintering the scaffolding of global peace. He is joined on the podcast by Mary Dejevsky, a columnist for <em>the Independent.</em> (00:42)</div>
<div>
<br>
<br>

</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Also this week: Will the monarchy survive past Elizabeth II?</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>The royal family is not in a good way, with the Queen missing multiple appearances due to ill health, a prince under investigation, and the continuing cold war between William and Harry, will the monarchy survive past Elizabeth II? That’s the question Freddy Gray asks in this week’s <em>Spectator</em>. He joins the podcast along with Patrick Jephson a former private secretary to Princess Diana, who also covers the royals in this week’s issue. (17:21)</div>
<div>  </div>
<div>
<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>And finally: Why is the mullet making a comeback? </div>
<div><br>

<div>Mullets. A hairstyle made popular in the 70s, but more recently the butt of many a joke is making something of a fashionable comeback.

Tessa's new book is <em>Army Girls: The Secrets and Stories of Military Service from the Final Few Women Who Fought In World War Two</em>. She tells Sam about how she gathered testimony and formed friendships with the nonagenarian veterans of the Second World War amid the Covid lockdown; about the class-ridden rivalries between the women's services; and how while still not officially in the front line, women during the war nevertheless found themselves in the thick of it. </div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Deng Xiaoping used to say, 'let some people get rich first'. Four decades on from the start of his economic experiment with marketisation, Xi Jinping is, these days, talking about 'common prosperity' instead - prosperity for the many, not the few. But what does this new economic direction mean in practice, and could it, in fact, stifle the very market forces that made so-called 'socialism with Chinese characteristics' so successful?<br>
<br>
Joining Cindy to read between the tea leaves is George Magnus, economist and author of <em>Red Flags: Why Xi's China is in Jeopardy</em>. We discuss how unequal China really is, what we know about common prosperity so far (e.g. arm-twisted philanthropy from billionaires like Jack Ma) and what Chinese public opinion might make of it all.</div>

<div><br>
</div>
<div>In our cover story this week, our editor Fraser Nelson takes a deep dive into No. 10 politics and finds a court of chaos inside. With a large parliamentary majority, an extremely young team and the departure of Domonic Cummings is there anyone left in the Conservative party who can stand up to the Prime Minister? Fraser talks on the podcast with former Conservative party chairman, Kenneth Baker on the reign of King Boris. (00:45)<br>
<br>

</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Also this week: Should the West be prepared to defend Taiwan?</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Tensions over the island of Taiwan are rising at an alarming rate. In <em>The Spectator</em> this week Alessio Patalano, professor of war and strategy at King’s College, and Elbridge Colby, author of <em>Strategy of Denia</em>l, both write about what the West can do to defend Taiwan’s autonomy. On the podcast, Alessio and Elbridge talk further about the future of this disputed territory. (17:09)</div>

</div>
<div>And finally: How do you join the world of underground chess? </div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>One of the world’s oldest games is making something of a comeback, with underground chess clubs starting up all over the world. Jamie Njoku-Goodwin, CEO of UK music, writes about this phenomenon in this week’s <em>Spectator</em>. He joins the podcast along with Nick Moar, <em>The Spectator’s</em> social media editor and chess enthusiast to discuss their favourite pastime.

What many of his fans might not know is that he's also a devoted scholar of Milton – whose influence is to be found in his first published poem <em>Pandemonium: Some Verses on the Current Predicament</em>. Armando tells Sam what hurt him into verse, identifies the moment that led him to abandon an English Literature PhD for a career in comedy – and explains why there's as much sadness as savagery in his mock-epic description of the Covid epidemic.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In this week’s episode: Has the Biden Presidency stalled or crashed?<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>In our cover story this week, Freddy Gray assesses the state of the Biden presidency. With steadily lowering approval ratings, a disastrous Afghanistan withdrawal, and this week’s failure of the Democrats to hold on to the Virginia Governorship, how much trouble is the US’s oldest inaugurated president in? Freddy talks to Lara along with Emily Tamkin, the US editor of the New Statesman and co-host of the World Review Podcast. </div>
<div>(00:49)</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Also this week: Should we welcome or fear the Metaverse?<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>Kit Wilson writes in The Spectator this week about Facebook’s new venture into the Metaverse, a concept that most of us probably hadn’t heard of until last week. To layout the roadmap for what our journey into this new digital reality might look like, Kit joins the podcast along with Tom Renner, a software engineer for NavVis.</div>
<div>(12:55)</div>
<div>   </div>
<div>And finally: Is the idea of ‘buy now pay later’ financially precarious for young people?<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>Gus Carter has been exploring the new Swedish-born app that is blowing up with the youth: Klarna. On its face, it seems to just be a modern replacement for a credit card with some gifts thrown in, but could this ‘buy now pay later’ model have some unexpected consequences for its users? Gus talks about his findings along with the author of the blog Young Money Iona Bain. </div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Over the past months, under the weight of a global pandemic, scientists and medical professionals have had to rethink the way they do things. We found not one - but numerous - vaccines within the space of a year; new treatments have been discovered, some repurposed from existing drugs; and manufacturers and politicians alike have had to think creatively to plug the gaps of the pandemic.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>There must be lessons we can learn from this experience - things that big pharma and scientists can do better in the future, having this time round done so in emergency circumstances. That’s the topic of this special episode of <em>The Spectator</em>’s podcast, sponsored by the pharmaceutical company Novartis.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>I’m delighted to be joined by a panel of expert guests. Chinmay Bhatt, Managing Director in the UK for Novartis, who we pressed on the importance of data science in pharmaceuticals. Professor Paul Martin, a sociologist tasked with finding better ways to collaborate between the medical sector and other sectors, who enlightened us on the un-mined potential of repurposing existing drugs. And Dr Nicole Mather, the Life Sciences Lead at the technology company IBM, who has been crucial to the UK’s pandemic response and working with regulators. She nicely summed up - through the lens of regulation - the kind of corners that can be cut, without compromising on healthcare quality:<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>'What Covid has been really helpful in, is helping us think about what's really essential. So a lot of the regulatory process has been pared back, or been able to run in parallel. So regulators are not doing away with any steps - just addressing them in a more thoughtful fashion'.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In this week’s Book Club podcast, Sam's guest is Claire Tomalin. Claire’s new book, <em>The Young H G Wells: Changing the World,</em> tracks the extraordinary life and rocket-powered career of one of the most influential writers of the Edwardian age. She talks to Sam about how drapery’s loss was literature’s gain, why casting the goatish Wells as a #metoo villain isn’t quite right - and why we should all be reading <em>Tono-Bungay.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>It's not easy to talk about the Cultural Revolution inside China - let alone teach it. In recent years, one of the last professors to have taught the period has been hounded out of her role at a top university. Sun Peidong has now taken a post at Cornell, after Chinese journals stopped publishing her work, the university party secretary banned her lectures, and even her students turned on her - denouncing Sun as if she were an 'anti-revolutionary' of the very period she taught.<br>
<br>
In this frank discussion, Cindy Yu interviews Sun about academic freedom and diversity of thought on Chinese campuses; about what it was like to shed light on a taboo subject to younger generations; and why she left China. It's an indictment on modern Chinese discourse that an internationally-renowned scholar such as Sun is now lost to Chinese academia.<br>
<br>
‘Look at China, now we have a huge impact. If we cannot handle our own social problems, what kind of impact will we leave to the whole [of] humankind?’ She asked me. And on whether China has got over the Cultural Revolution:<br>
<br>
‘If you forbid people, professors, or students, or young generation, to have [the] opportunity to fully discover the history – and the dark side of the history – how can you imagine that our nation can move on?’</div>

How can we protect people from fuel poverty when bills are predicted to rise by hundreds of pounds? Moreover, as COP26 kicks off, how can this crisis be framed within the government's plans for a green future? Kate Andrews speaks to Rebecca Sedler, the director for policy and regulation at EDF, Alan Brown MP, shadow SNP spokesperson on energy and climate change and Jonny Marshall, who is a senior economist at the Resolution Foundation. </div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>These days the Conservative party is not just associated with the colour blue - it’s also the winner of the red wall seats; the pursuer of a green agenda. But do these new identities, achieved under Boris Johnson, all fit together? In particular, critics often label tackling climate change as a middle class pursuit, not what ‘real people’ around the country are concerned with. And indeed, the Treasury and BEIS have put the costs of net zero at £70bn a year, so what does that mean for the less well off in society, especially those in the Tories’ new constituencies in the red wall?<br>
<br>
This discussion was recorded at Conservative Party Conference on October 5. Cindy Yu, The Spectator's broadcast editor, talks to Andrew Griffith MP, the government's net zero business champion and parliamentary private secretary; Sarah Longlands, chief executive of the Centre for Local Economic Strategies; and Nick Baird, group director of corporate affairs at Centrica, which is kindly sponsoring this podcast.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In this week’s episode: Can Cop26 deliver on its grand promises? <br>
In our cover story this week, Fraser Nelson assesses the state of the upcoming Cop26 summit in Glasgow and questions their very effectiveness in dealing with climate change in a world of global players with very different priorities. He is joined on the podcast by reporter Jess Shankleman, who is covering Cop26 for Bloomberg. (00:48)<br>
<br>
<em>‘This one’s in Glasgow, but you’d best think of it as the Edinburgh Festival for environmentalism. Lots of fun, lots of debates, lots of protests, lots of street action, but not really any much of concrete substance.’ </em>– Fraser Nelson<br>
 <br>
<br>
Also this week: Is it moral to bribe your child to go to church?<br>
Theo Hobson is paying his daughter to go to church and get confirmed. But how holy is this practice? Theo's idea is judged on the podcast by a holy trinity of priests: Steve Morris, Daniel French, and Nicholas Cranfield. (13:28)<br>
<br>
<em> ‘I’d be very worried if there was a suggestion that they as younger people are being prevailed upon to answer the right questions and say ‘actually Dad I do now believe!’ Simply for the exchange of some filthy lucre.’</em> – Rev. Nicholas Cranfield<br>
<br>
  <br>
And finally: What are the ups and downs of book clubs?<br>
Author Elisa Segrave was cancelled from a book club event after an email of hers apparently ‘hurt’ some members. This inspired her analysis of the book club concept for this week’s Spectator. Along with Simon Savidge the founder of Savidge Reads, she talks about her and her friends' bumpy relationship with book clubs. (25:10)<br>
<br>
<em>‘I was always really excited for what that next choice would be because it was like a mystery until that final moment or final glass of wine.’</em> – Simon Savidge<br>
<br>
<br>
Hosted by Lara Prendergast<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In this week’s Book Club podcast, Sam Leith's guest is the historian Jane Ridley, talking about her new book <em>George V: Never A Dull Moment</em>. She tells him there’s so much more to the 'boring' monarch than shooting grouse and collecting stamps. Hear how he navigated some of the worst constitutional crises in memory, saved the British monarchy as the grand dynasties of Europe started toppling… and then inadvertently imperilled it again by his treatment of his son and heir.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>
<em>Aftershock</em> is an occasional podcast series by award-winning journalist Isabel Hardman. In every episode she asks how we can fix the damage caused by the pandemic to a different part of British society.<br>
<br>
In this episode, Isabel looks at how schoolchildren have been affected by 18 months of lockdowns and remote schooling. Some have been hit harder than others: in fact, there are now more children missing from school rolls than at the start of the pandemic. Where have these ‘ghost children’ gone? And does the government’s response come anywhere close to being enough to stop Covid from being a blight on the rest of their lives, rather than an episode most can easily recover from?<br>
<br>
Featuring: James Scales, head of the Education Policy Unit at the Centre for Social Justice; two young people from the Leicestershire Cares charity; Jan Appleton, who is the director of the Eagle’s Nest Project; Lord Blunkett who was education secretary in the Blair government, Rachel de Souza, the children's commissioner for England, and Robert Halfon, the chair of the education select committee.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Last week, the US and Canada each sent a warship through the Taiwan Strait and Taiwan has appealed to the US for faster delivery of fighter aircraft. It's been a tense month in the Strait, kicked off by China's celebration of its national day on October 1 through flying a record number of aircraft through Taiwan's air defense identification zone. Could war really happen? Could China really successfully take Taiwan?<br>
<br>
Cindy Yu speaks to Oriana Skylar Mastro, fellow at Stanford and the American Enterprise Institute, whose detailed piece for Foreign Affairs took a close look at China's military options: <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2021-06-03/china-taiwan-war-temptation">https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2021-06-03/china-taiwan-war-temptation</a>.<br>
<br>
To find out just why China cares about Taiwan so much, tune into a previous episode of Chinese Whispers where Cindy Yu speaks to Professor Rana Mitter and analyst Jessica Drun: <a href="https://www.spectator.co.uk/podcast/why-does-china-care-about-taiwan-">https://www.spectator.co.uk/podcast/why-does-china-care-about-taiwan-</a>.</div>

With 1400 restaurants, over 23,000 British and Irish farmers and four million customers visiting them every day, will it be enough? Or is it just a drop in the ocean?

We’ll be taking a look at each one of these, in addition to discussing the challenges the fast-food giant will face. Kate Andrews is joined by a panel of three guests to discuss this and more: <br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In this week’s episode: Why are a growing number of people putting the planet before parenthood? Madeleine Kearns writes about this phenomenon in this week’s issue and thinks that some of these fears might be unfounded. Tom Woodman author of <em>Future</em> is one of these people that Madeleine’s piece talks about. Tom has very real worries about bringing a child into the world. It's not only the least green thing he could do but also that the standard of living for that child could be severely limited due to a climate catastrophe. (00:47)</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Also this week: Has Boris Johnson brought Conservatism full circle? That’s the argument Tim Stanley makes in this week’s <em>Spectator</em>. He joins Lara on the podcast along with one of the MPs mentioned in the piece, Steve Baker. (12:50)</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>And finally: What is the state of the Booker Prize shortlist? The Booker Prize shortlist has been released and it’s fair to say one of our critics Philip Hensher is not too impressed with the batch. But how are these books selected? What are the criteria? Can a Booker Prize winner be funny? To answer all those questions, Philip joins Lara along with <em>The Spectator’s</em> Books Editor and former Booker judge, Sam Leith. (20:51)</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>The University of Nottingham has been forced to abandon its sinister attempt to ban Fr David Palmer from becoming its Catholic chaplain because his defence of unborn life might upset snowflakes. In this episode of Holy Smoke, I talk to one of Fr Palmer's key allies, Ryan Christopher, UK director of Alliance Defending Freedom, about that appalling episode and its backdrop: a sneaky culture of below-the-radar censorship driven in large part by student unions. Needless to say, the latter are furious that this government is passing legislation to protect free speech on campuses. Ryan has the details. </div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In this week’s episode: with the energy crisis picking up pace who are set to be the winners and losers in this cold war for gas? Domestically we are seeing queues for petrol, rising gas prices all in the face of the Government’s net-zero agenda. And internationally things are looking just as turbulent, with China buying up as much fuel as possible, America becoming more isolationist when it comes to its energy supply, and Russia feeling more powerful in its place thanks to its Nord Stream 2 pipeline. These are the issues that Seb Kennedy, the founding editor of<em> Energy Flux</em>, addresses in his cover piece this week for <em>The Spectator</em>. He speaks about his findings on the podcast along with Senior Reporter for Energy and Commodities for <em>Bloomberg</em> and co-author of <em>The World for Sale</em>, Jack Farchy. (00:50)</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Also this week: can the police reform with Cressida Dick still in charge? Leroy Logan writes in this week’s <em>Spectator</em> that if the Met and police are to reform its subculture of racism and misogyny it can’t be done with Cressida Dick still at the helm. He is joined on the podcast by Sharon Haye, a former officer and policing advocate. (14:06)</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>And finally: what is the future for British butchery? Olivia Potts is learning butchery. And in this week’s <em>Spectator</em>, she writes about her experiences as well as the state of the industry in the UK today. Nigel Jarvis is a fourth-generation butcher who has just retired after an unexpected boom in custom during lockdown. (28:52)</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Throughout Chinese history, as seen by poems and novels, drinking has been seen as a source for literary inspiration; or a form of manly competition; or, as ever, a status symbol. After a century of political turmoil in which the way people lived was radically disrupted, drinking culture is now coming back with China's growing wealth. As well as the traditional rice and sorghum spirits, grape wine is starting to dominate the Chinese palate.<br>
<br>
On this episode, Cindy Yu's guest Janet Z Wang, author of <em>The Chinese Wine Renaissance</em>, tells her all about the then and the now of Chinese drinking. They chat poetry and wine, noughties extravagance (including a Bordeaux sold for $234,000) and the peculiarities of Chinese drinking culture.</div>

<br>
They were Blutick, which is taking maths teaching online to a new level; Petalite, which offers powerful solutions for electric vehicle recharging; Regionally, which connects private investors to high-growth companies seeking capital across the UK regions; and Zipbout, an app to make travelling across transport networks easier and more efficient. <br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Our venue for the Yorkshire &amp; North East regional final was the former Leeds Club — where the entrepreneurs of the region’s textile and other manufacturing industries would once have congregated. <br>
<br>
We welcomed back guest judges Caroline Theobald, a leading promoter of entrepreneurship in Newcastle and the North East, and Gordon Black, a venture capitalist and former manufacturer from West Yorkshire — plus a trio of Charles Stanley’s Leeds representatives. <br>
<br>
Our four finalists were all in cutting-edge technologies: Honcho in online vehicle insurance; Testcard in easy-access patient testing for healthcare; Element 2 in hydrogen power for truck and bus fleets; and Micropore in pharm manufacturing. <br>
<br>
Again, a near-impossible choice but a terrific conversation — and a range of entries from a geographical spread that tells us entrepreneurship is alive and well in the UK provinces.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>As the UK faces a rising energy crisis with gas supplies in short supply, questions are arising of not just how we mitigate the problem in the short term but how we hedge against it in the long term? What role might nuclear energy play? What’s slowing down its development? Is it the technology? The funding? Or public attitudes towards nuclear energy. Can hearts and minds be swayed in its favour?<br>
<br>
Kate Andrews is joined by Mark Jenkinson MP, vice chair of the All-Party Parliamentary Group on Nuclear Energy and formerly a self-employed contractor in the nuclear supply chain; Wade Allison is emeritus professor at the University of Oxford; and Julia Pyke is the nuclear development director at EDF.<br>
<br>

<br>
Veteran judges Ian Ritchie — a prominent Scottish tech investor – and former Award winner Irene McAleese of See.Sense in Northern Ireland joined John Porteous of Charles Stanley to meet four finalists. <br>
<br>
These were, in relatively low-tech consumer sectors, two very attractive ventures, Highland Soap and Scottish Bee, which markets Heather Honey; in the energy sector, Renewable Parts, which provides recycled components for wind turbines; and in the highest of high-tech healthcare, Sonrai Analytics from Belfast, an AI-driven ‘digital pathology’ spin-out from Queens University. <br>
<br>
All very persuasive presentations. Onwards to the final judging…</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In this week’s episode: is Boris Johnson running on empty or is a weak opposition giving him the momentum he needs? Kate Andrews asks in her cover story this week if Boris Johnson’s government has run out of ideas – as well as petrol. Katy Balls also writes in the magazine that the opposition seems unable to take advantage of the government’s failures. Katy and Kate join William on the podcast to give their takes on the state of both parties. (00:51)</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Also this week: what is behind China’s latest crackdown on cryptocurrency? Ian Williams writes in this week’s Spectator that the CCP’s latest move to criminalise anyone dealing in cryptocurrency is to clear the decks for China’s new, state-sanctioned digital currency. He along with George Magnus, author of <em>Red Flags, Why Xi’s China is in jeopardy </em>speak on the podcast about<em> </em>Beijing’s crypto future. (14:15)</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>And finally: are the Marvel movies – good? Love them or hate them, these superhero blockbusters have dominated the box office for more than a decade and have redefined pop culture. They may not have received particularly positive reviews in the <em>Spectator</em> over the years, but Rosie Millard has jumped to their defence in the magazine’s lead arts feature this week. She guests on the podcast to try and convince William to give Marvel a chance. (26:18)</div>

<div> Hosted by William Moore</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>This year’s regional finals for <em>The Spectator</em>’s Economic Innovator of the Year Awards kicked off with a fascinating session in a private dining room of the boutique hotel One Aldwych. <br>
<br>
We managed to pack representatives of all 12 finalists (chosen from 90-plus entrants for the region round one table), plus guest judges Paul Abberley (CEO of our sponsor, Charles Stanley Wealth Managers) and former Award winner Jonny Ohlson of Touchlight, the pioneering DNA manufacturer.<br>
<br>
With entrants ranging across the healthcare, fintech, food, energy and education sectors, as well as social media and high-tech engineering — and only around eight minutes for each to present and answer questions — the judges faced a formidable task. And of course the final choice of winners has to be subjective rather than scientific. But all the presentations were clear and concise — and there were several conversations across the table suggesting possible synergies between entrants in related business fields. <br>
<br>
So, as always, we hope participants gain from the networking opportunities as well as the accolade of being selected as finalists — and we hope <em>Spectator</em> readers and podcast listeners will take a few minutes to explore their websites and products.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In this week’s episode: can the new Aukus alliance contain China? In his cover piece this week, James Forsyth writes that the new Aukus pact has fixed the contours of the next 30 years of British foreign policy. Britain, he says, is no longer trying to stay neutral in the competition between America and China. On the podcast James is joined by Francis Pike, author of <em>Empires at War: A Short History of Modern Asia Since World War II</em>, who also wrote for the magazine this week, giving the case against Aukus. (00:45)<br>
<br>
Also this week: what can be done to save the Church of England’s parishes? Back in February, Emma Thompson, a rural parish volunteer, and the Reverend Marcus Walker, Rector of St Bartholomew the Great, London, wrote pieces for the Spectator expressing their concern for the future of the Church of England’s parish system. The Archbishops of Canterbury and York dismissed these concerns as scaremongering from ‘rascally voices’. Seven months on there is a new threat to the parish, which Emma writes about in this week’s magazine. She is joined by Marcus on the podcast to explain what you can do to save your local church. </div>
<div>. (16:35)<br>
<br>
And finally: in a time when travel has never been faster, why has so little been done to reform queues? This is the question Harry Mount asks in the magazine this week. He sits down with me now, with the Spectator’s Wiki Man columnist, Rory Sutherland to pitch some transformative ideas on how to update this very British pastime.  (29:10)<br>

Mikkel has sifted through the archives to discover the real stories anonymised in the case studies on which Sigmund Freud based his theories, and the lives of the patients who submitted to analysis on the great man's original couch. What he discovered is startling. Mikkel tells Sam how Freud falsified the data to fit his theories, kept incurable cases coming back week after week to keep the fees rolling in - and how the global industry of Freudian analysis resembles a religious cult more than a science.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>For China, WWII started in 1937 with the Japanese invasion, two years before Hitler invaded Poland. Japan would occupy China until its surrender in 1945, in the process committing atrocities like the rape of Nanjing. This was the second Japanese invasion in fifty years. </div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Yet decades after the war, when I grew up in Nanjing, Japanese food was all the craze and it was Japanese anime that kids watched and Japanese fashion that teenagers craved. So has China got over its wartime hatred of Japan?</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>On this episode, I’m joined by the Tokyo-based Chinese translator Dylan Levi King, who you might remember from our previous conversation on ketamine use in China. We’re going to be chatting about China’s attitude to Japan today, and the contradictions within that, rather than focusing on the history between the two countries. If you want to learn more about that part of things – there’s nowhere better to go than Professor Rana Mitter’s book, <em>China’s War with Japan</em>. Dylan and I chat about the Chinese caricatures of Japanese soldiers on screen, the Japanese porn star who overcame the two countries’ enmity and the <em>jingri</em> – the Chinese who identify as ‘spiritually Japanese’.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Dylan reflects on the cognitive dissonance – or disassociation – that the Chinese hold between Japanese politics and Japanese soft power. For example, he tells me that:</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div><em>‘I used to go to this clothing store when I was a student in China, and in the store they would sell Japanese fashion like BAPE, but on the doorstep walking into the place there was a Japanese flag on the ground, so you could trample on the Japanese flag as you walk into buy all your Japanese fashion.’</em></div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Japanese nationalism, in return, seems to be getting louder, whether it’s visits to the Yasukuni shrine housing war criminals, or a continued refusal to acknowledge the war-time trafficking of Chinese and Korean women as sex slaves – euphemistically known as ‘comfort women’. Yet Dylan argues that this is just all bark, no bite:</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div><em>‘China rising on its doorstep and Japan’s economy, since 1990, not really improving, has exacerbated that feeling in Japan of wanting to stand up, even though they can’t really. So it’s all performative and useless.’</em></div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Say what you like about Pope Francis, but he's incapable of giving a boring in-flight interview. On Wednesday, coming back from Hungary and Slovakia, he was asked about the problem of pro-abortion Catholic politicians receiving Holy Communion. He immediately launched into a ferocious denunciation of abortion, describing it as homicide, saying there was no middle way and stating that support for abortion was grounds for 'excommunication'. </div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Francis then slightly qualified this by explaining that these 'excommunicated' Catholics needed to be lovingly shown the error of their ways, but it was hard to escape the obvious conclusion. The Pope regards the President as barred from Communion – which drives a horse and cart through the 'don't ask, don't tell' policy of Biden's own bishop, Cardinal Wilton Gregory of Washington. </div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>In this week's Holy Smoke, Dr Ed Condon, canon lawyer and editor of the brilliant Catholic website The Pillar, offers us an admirably lucid 'explainer' on this complicated topic. His conclusion is basically the same as mine. Though Ed wouldn't put it this way, the Pope has just thrown the fanatically pro-choice President of the United States under the bus. </div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In this week’s episode: is Brexit to blame for the rise in blue-collar wages? With labour shortages driving wages up, many have blamed Britain’s removal from the single market. However, this week in <em>The Spectator</em>, Matthew Lynn argues that shocks and price signals are how the free-market economy reorganises, and that we are experiencing a global trend just like America and Germany. Simon Jenkins, columnist for the <em>Guardian</em>, joins Matthew to discuss. (00:45)<br>
<br>
Also this week: the British Medical Association has dropped its opposition to assisted dying, but is euthanasia really a dignified and painless process? Dr Joel Zivot asks this question in <em>The Spectator</em> magazine, drawing upon his own experience as an expert witness against the use of lethal injection in America. Dr Jacky Davis, radiologist and chair of the Healthcare Professionals for Assisted Dying, disagrees. Davis, who pushed the motion causing the BMA to change its position, calls claims that assisted dying is a painful process 'unscientific shroud-waving', a claim she debates with Dr Zivot this week. (13:43)<br>
<br>
And finally, Non-Fungible Tokens are selling at extortionate prices online, and are proudly hanging on the virtual walls of many. But can they really be considered art? Jack Rivlin writes about his own experience of purchasing NFTs in this week's <em>Spectator</em>. He is joined by Nima Sagharachi, director of Middle Eastern, Islamic and South Asian Art at Bonhams.

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this week's episode: why is the Prime Minister so desperate to support the assetocracy? In <em>The Spectator</em>’s cover story this week, after Boris Johnson revealed his plan to pay for social care with a National Insurance increase, Fraser Nelson says there has been an inversion of the welfare state. It is right to ask the working poor to pay more taxes to help cover the social care of people who could easily fund it themselves? Kate Andrews, The Spectator’s economics editor, joins Fraser to discuss. (00:47)<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>Plus, why is our knowledge of Soviet atrocities so poor? Attempting to fix this, James Bartholomew has been interviewing and recording the stories of survivors of Soviet oppression and torture. In the magazine this week, he tells a few of these stories, but also asks the question: why is it acceptable, or even trendy, to declare yourself a communist? James discusses his project with Konstantin Kisin, a Russian born comic and host of the Triggernometry podcast whose family lived under a Soviet regime. (16:18)</div>
<br>
<div>And finally, why does London have so many American sweet shops? Some of London’s busiest streets are host to them, taking up prime real estate in the capital. Hannah Moore writes about her confusion with this phenomenon in this week’s <em>Spectator</em>. She joins Lara along with food trend expert Shokofeh Hejazi. (26:46)</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Are the Chinese religious? The government’s treatment of Christians and particularly Muslims have been under scrutiny in recent years. But these religious groups only form around 4 per cent of the Chinese population, according to national surveys. So what do the other 96pc believe in?</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>The CCP is famously atheist, but that doesn’t mean the society is faithless. Even today, most Han families, including Cindy Yu's, still sweep the tombs of our ancestors and burn paper money (and these days paper cars and paper iPhones) for their use in the afterlife.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>In particular, Buddhism, Daoism and Confucianism have grown together, over the centuries, to provide what the Chinese call ‘<em>sanjiao heyi</em>’ – three teachings harmonious as one, and these continue to influence Chinese life. Growing up, Cindy never knew which part of my temple visit belonged to which faith. One social scientist has described Chinese faith as ‘an empty bowl, which can be variously filled’.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>On this episode of Chinese Whispers, we’ll be taking a look at what the three teachings teach, and how, in modern China, they've perhaps become more cultural than religious.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Joining Cindy on this podcast is Mark Meulenbeld, Associate Professor at the Hong Kong Polytechnic University, who is an expert on Chinese folk religion.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this week's episode: should animal lives be considered as valuable as human lives? It’s often said that Britain is a country of animal lovers, but have we taken it too far? Pen Farthing’s evacuation has shown how some people value animal lives more than human lives. William Moore writes our cover piece this week, arguing that the public outcry is emblematic of our faith-like approach to animal rights in Britain. He joins the podcast together with the <em>FT</em>'s Henry Mance, author of <em>How to Love Animals</em>. (00:50)<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>Plus, will the government’s proposed tax reforms solve the crisis in social care? In this week’s issue, Kate Andrews argues that instead of solving the crisis in care, the plans will only worsen intergenerational inequality. To discuss, Kate joins the podcast with Steve Webb, a pensions expert who was formerly a Lib Dem minister in the Coalition. (13:00)<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>And finally, what are the benefits of having godparents in this secular age? Although she never wanted children of her own, Fiona Mountford writes in this week’s <em>Spectator</em> that she knew she always wanted godchildren. Why? Fiona joins the podcast, together with Mary Killen, <em>the Spectator’s </em>Dear Mary columnist. (24:00)</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Religious freedom is already being mercilessly attacked in Taliban-run Afghanistan: Muslim women in particular face a living hell unless they're happy to submit to their new rulers' psychotic brand of Sharia. </div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>The United States is required by its own laws to do everything it can to champion religious liberty around the world. But Afghan's moderate Muslims, China's Uighurs, Myanmar's Rohynga and Christians in dozens of countries would be foolish to trust President Joe Biden, whose administration can't wait to dismantle the First Amendment Rights of conservative Christians back home. </div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>My guest is Andrea Picciotti-Bayer of the Washington-based Conscience Project, which speaks up for people of faith who commit the thought crime of not subscribing to liberal gender ideology. Like many people, she's worried by Biden's partisan choice of personnel for US international religious freedom posts. None of them are Christians. It's an enlightening but alarming discussion. Don't miss it. </div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Last month, the Chinese Foreign Minister Wang Yi welcomed senior Taliban leaders to Beijing, standing shoulder to shoulder for the photographers. China is carefully watching events unfold in Afghanistan. And while it hasn’t yet recognised the Taliban government, the Beijing meeting was a nod towards a potential alliance.</div>
<br>
<div>But replacing America in Afghanistan wouldn’t be without its risks – can Beijing succeed where Washington failed? America's 20 year mission in the country cost lives and money. And what would a closer alliance mean for China’s Xinjiang policy, considering the close links that the Taliban has historically had with militant Uyghur groups? <br>
<br>
Cindy Yu speaks to Tom Miller, author of <em>China's Asian Dream</em>, and Dr Mike Martin, author of <em>An Intimate War</em> and former British Army officer in Helmand.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>On this week’s podcast:</div>
<div>
<br>
In the latest issue of <em>The Spectator</em>, we cover the Afghanistan issue extensively, looking at everything from why the West was doomed from the start, to how events in Afghanistan have transformed central Asian politics. On the podcast, journalist Paul Wood and our own deputy editor Freddy Gray, both of whom feature in this week’s issue, join Lara to talk Biden, Boris and the new 'progressive' Taliban. (00:37)</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>
<em>'This is not your father's Taliban'</em> - Paul Wood</div>
<div>
<br>
Next up, thousands of women whose menstrual cycles have been affected by the Covid vaccine have now come forward to make their symptoms known, including our  host Lara Prendergast, who writes about her experience in this week's <em>Spectator</em>. We continue that conversation with Jessica Braun, who was the host of the <em>Periodical</em> podcast and Dr Joe Mountfield from the Royal College of Obstetricians and Gynaecologists. (12:12)</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>
<em>‘I don't think your piece is anti-vaxx, I don't think you're anti-vaxx, I think expressing some concerns and airing what's happened to you is absolutely legitimate and valid’</em> - Dr Jo Mountfield</div>
<div>
<br>
And finally, while many during the pandemic have fled London for greener pastures, our own Martin Vander Weyer has moved back to the city after more than 30 years of Yorkshire living. He writes about his new Covent Garden lifestyle in this week’s issue, and He joins us on the Edition along with William Moore, who has done the opposite, having left London with his young family to become a country gent. (25:39)</div>
<div>
<br>
<em>'With the upmost respect, I think you're mad!' </em>- William Moore </div>
<div>
<br>
Presented by Lara Prendergast</div>
<div>
<br>
Produced by Sam Holmes</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In this week's Book Club podcast Sam Leith is talking to Michael Pye about his new book <em>Antwerp: The Glory Years. </em>For most of the 16th century, as he tells Sam, Antwerp was the most important town in the western world – a city in which, as never before, ideas, information, goods and money circulated free of almost any authority. It was a time of extraordinary excitement – here are Bruegel, Thomas More and William Tyndale – and enormous danger and corruption. Michael tells Sam how it came about, what lessons it offers our own age... and how it reached an abrupt and bloody end.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In the last episode of Holy Smoke, I discussed Pope Francis's brutal and petty new document which seeks to ban as many Latin Masses as possible. This week we look at the other recent developments, which are arguably just as disturbing: two criminal prosecutions in which close allies of the Pope are accused of a range of hair-raising offences – and the question of how much Francis knew about their activities still hasn't been answered, either by the Vatican or its tame press corps.. Also, I touch on a new explanation for Rome's dreadful pact with China. Did the Pope's Secretary of State sign away the freedom of Chinese Catholics because Beijing was threatening to release data relating to the use of the gay hook-up app Grindr inside the walls of the Vatican? We may never find out. But one day there will be a new pope. Is it too much to hope that the college of cardinals will learn from the disasters of the past eight years? </div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Conversations about ‘modernising’ the NHS have been happening for almost as long as the NHS itself. The 2019 Long Term Plan put so-called ‘patient-centred care’ at the forefront, writing that: “The NHS also needs a more fundamental shift in how we work alongside patients and individuals to deliver more person-centred care, recognising – as National Voices has championed – the importance of ‘what matters to someone’ is not just ‘what’s the matter with someone’.”</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>All well and good, but then, came the pandemic. The new health secretary Sajid Javid has said that that waiting list will rise to 13 million people in the coming months.</div>
<div><br>
</div>
<div>Where does that leave efforts to modernise the NHS now, and in particular for that patient-led vision that the Long Term Plan had set out?<br>
<br>
<strong>Kate Andrews</strong> hosts this special episode of Spectator Sounds with a panel of expert guests:<br>
<strong>Sir Jim Mackey</strong>, head of Northumbria’s NHS Trust and former head of NHS Improvement<br>
<strong>Charlotte Augst,</strong> head of National Voices, a coalition group of patient-centred health charities<br>
<strong>Todd Manning, </strong>the Vice-President and General Manager of Abbvie UK.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>It might be an understatement to say that China has a difficult relationship with drugs. Most infamously, the Opium Wars of the 1800s saw British soldiers fight against the Qing dynasty to protect the British right to sell opium to China. When the Qing lost, it wasn’t just the sobriety of their people that they lost – but a series of ports, concessions and reparations signed away in so-called ‘unequal treaties’. Hong Kong was lost to the British at this point, and it’s where the Chinese mark the start of the century of humiliation.</div>
<br>
<div>The memory and trauma of opium addiction is still bound up with national decline in the Chinese conscience.</div>
<br>
<div>So Cindy Yu was surprised to read about widespread drug use (especially ketamine) in the early 2000s in a recent <a href="https://palladiummag.com/2021/06/23/ketamine-and-the-return-of-the-party-state/">article</a> by the translator and writer Dylan Levi King. Dylan joins this episode, and they talk about what the popularity of ket says about China's reform and opening, how the Chinese see drug abuse as a disease than a crime, and President Xi's moralistic clampdown on the party scene in the years since.</div>

<div><br>
</div>
<div>On the episode, Michael recounts election night and the moment Fox called Arizona, why he has little sympathy for the voters who still believe the election was 'stolen', and what it was like to catch up with Trump at Mar-a-Lago. </div>

Iain takes Sam on a journey though how, and why, the Russians cut a city in half overnight; and why we let them. He describes how events in Tiananmen Square reached Friedrichstrasse. And how, as the Wall came down, a single British soldier did something that the Red Army never forgot. </div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Responsible for 17 per cent of the UK’s carbon usage, government will be looking to the private sector to reduce its emissions in the years to come. But what does it really mean for a business to achieve ‘net zero’? Should companies - and their sectors - account only for their direct emissions, or must they also measure their indirect impact, related to supply chains or digital carbon footprints? How should businesses address their historic emissions - and what might this mean for once carbon-intensive sectors? <br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>For most people, Mao Zedong and Xi Jinping stand out as <em>the</em> two Communist leaders of the People’s Republic of China. But growing up, it was actually a third man, by the name of Deng Xiaoping, whose legacy I felt the most.</div>
<br>
<div>Though less than 5 foot tall, his impact on China’s trajectory was arguably more than Mao’s; and possibly will be more than Xi’s. It was Deng’s vision of reform and opening – which we’ve talked about in passing many times on this podcast – that started a process which transformed China from a Maoist backwater to today’s economic backwater.

<div>Yet it was also Deng who gave the final go ahead for the military clampdown of the Tiananmen Square protests. So what sort of leader and politician was he, and how do we reconcile the seeming contradictions between Deng the liberal reformer, and Deng the communist autocrat?<br>

But as Britain reopens after Covid-19 and plans for ‘Global Britain’ take off, will the green agenda become a dominant feature of our trade negotiations, or a side-line strategy? What does Britain have to offer its trading partners when it comes to negative emissions and boosting global recovery? Can Britain lead the way in the export of green technologies such as carbon capture and hydrogen? In what areas can international cooperation on climate change be enhanced through trade? In partnership with Drax</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>The way the City of London measures success is constantly changing. A new generation of discerning consumers has skyrocketed the importance of environmental, social, and corporate governance (ESG) to company decision-makers. The finance sector is increasingly being seen as the next frontier in climate action. As the City navigates the post-Brexit landscape and our pandemic recovery it will also be tasked with redefining its role on the world stage. How will the government's net-zero commitment and the targets in the Paris Agreement factor into corporate decision-making? How will banks and other financial institutions change how they weigh up sustainable investment choices? And what impact could all this have on the broader economy? Join Spectator journalists, politicians and industry experts as they discuss The City's future climate and environmental agenda.  In collaboration with WWF.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Tangping, or 'lying flat', is a new lifestyle tempting China's millennials. Describing a minimalist stress-free life where one opts out of a career and raising family, lying flat is the young person's desperate answer to the infinite rat race of modern Chinese workplaces and society. But while there are few lie-flatters as of yet, the allure of the lifestyle has propelled the term into the mainstream. On this episode, Cindy Yu discusses the phenomenon with millennial journalist Karoline Kan, author of <em>Under Red Skies. </em>They talk about why young people are pessimistic about life in a growing China, whether they are a 'snowflake generation' compared to the struggles of their parents and what this means for the Chinese government's social contract with the people.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Who is John Galt? This week's Book Club podcast looks at the life, work and personality of Ayn Rand, probably the most influential writer you've never read. A favourite of our new Health Secretary, the author of <em>Atlas Shrugged </em>-- and the most strident advocate of the idea that "greed is good" -- continues to be revered and reviled four decades after her death. What was it that made her work speak so powerfully to so many? Does her philosophical system add up? How was she shaped -- first by the Russian Revolution and then by Hollywood?<em> </em>And where does prog rock come into it? I'm joined by Professor Lisa Duggan -- author of <em>Mean Girl: Ayn Rand and the Culture of Greed</em>, and Adam Roberts, the science fiction writer and professor of English at Royal Holloway, University of London.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In the 12 months since the enactment of the National Security Law on Hong Kong, opposition leaders, journalists and activists have been arrested; reforms on education and elections begun; and last week saw the emotional closure of the pro-democracy tabloid Apple Daily.<br>
<br>
On this episode, I speak to Jennifer Creery, who works for the Financial Times in Hong Kong, about the situation on the ground; and Professor Jeff Wasserstrom, a historian of China at the University of California, about the last year and the city's future. We reflect on the strategic erosion over time of Hong Kong's autonomy, the importance of education that the CCP places on its Hong Kong policy, and whether the 2019 protests actually expedited the choking off of the city.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>A few weeks ago, a company called Darktrace - put together by computer programmers in London and Cambridge - floated on the London Stock Exchange. It was valued at over £2 billion. It’s a pretty good example of a British tech success - its shares surged by 44 per cent, in stark contrast to Deliveroo, a better-known name, whose flotation saw its shares sink by 26%. So what does Darktrace’s success tell us about Britain’s ability to nurture tech companies and floating them here in Britain, rather than sending them to America? <br>
<br>
Fraser Nelson speaks to the billionaire entrepreneur behind Darktrace, Mike Lynch, on this podcast. They talk about the true meaning of British tech, why America does it just so well, and whether we are seeing the beginnings of tech nationalism.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Exactly 20 years ago, China acceded to the World Trade Organisation. In the decades since, the globalised world became what we know today, with hundreds of millions of Chinese and people around the world lifted out of poverty through free trade. But the promised liberalisation - both economic and political - doesn't seem to have happened. China is now challenging western-led world order, and too difficult to disentangle from the world economy. So was it a mistake to allow China into the WTO, and has engagement failed?<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>What is it like to be a journalist in China? There are obvious restrictions on freedom of speech, but, as Cindy Yu finds out on this episode, there are creative ways to navigate the strict system of censorship. The end result is a complex media landscape - some have to litter investigations with state propaganda; others continue to report on sensitive issues (like the Wuhan Covid cover up) and rely on editors for protection; while growing digitisation and a strongman President continue to threaten what little independence flourished at the beginning of the century.<br>
<br>
With political scientist Maria Repnikova, author of <em>Media Politics in China</em>, and former journalist Fang Kecheng, now an Associate Professor in Journalism at the Chinese University of Hong Kong.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>The past year has served as a reminder how quickly one's personal circumstances can change. In uncertain times such as these, financial resilience is more important than ever. But whilst savings for some Brits have surged in the pandemic, it's not been the case for everyone. 41pc of UK households could not last more than three months without their main source of income. If you are in a bad place, what are the best steps?<br>
<br>
Katy Balls is joined by Tracey Crouch, Conservative MP and former minister for sports, civil society and loneliness, who's also been a leading campaigner on gambling reform; Bridget Phillipson, shadow chief secretary to the Treasury; and Nicola Bannister, Lloyds Banking Group's Collections Effectiveness Director for Retail.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In this week’s podcast, we talk to James Ball, author of this week’s cover story on the ‘TikTok Intifada’ about the themes he uncovers in his analysis of the impact of social media on the conflict in the Middle East. The conversation with James continues with our next guest, Professor Gabriel Weinmann of Haifa University in Israel, the author of an in-depth report on the rise of incendiary, unregulated material on TikTok. As Arab and Israeli youngsters create and consume violent footage on the app, is it time that it was reined in - or is it a lost cause? </div>
<div>
<br>
'This is a platform that targets young audiences. I would say we have a very young, gullible and naïve, unsuspecting type of audience' - Dr Gabriel Weinmann</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Next up, The Spectator’s deputy editor Freddy Gray meets the <em>Financial Times</em>’s Jemima Kelly, to debate the recent lulls and highs of those mercurial currencies, Dogecoin and Bitcoin. Has the cult of Elon Musk, a new clampdown by China and the erratic unpredictability of a boom built largely on hype, memes and hot air, finally put the kibosh on cryptocash?  </div>
<div> </div>
<div>'If we talk about bitcoin, there’s really not a difference between bitcoin and dogecoin apart from that fact that one says it’s a joke and one says it's really serious!' Jemima Kelly</div>
<div> </div>
<div>And finally - the annual Turner art prize rarely fails to spark a bit of controversy and this year’s nominations have reliably provided. There’s been plenty in the way of debate, but not especially in terms of tangible art. The 2021 shortlist comprises five ‘collectives’, most of whom some of whom have barely touched a paintbrush in their lives, has been announced - and in this week’s magazine, art critic Oliver Basciano argues that the politicisation of the Turner is in danger of sidelining values of aesthetics and free expression. He’s joined by critic and author Hettie Judah, to mull over what, how, and why the radical line-up of nominees have been selected and what this means to the British art world. </div>

<div>‘It’s an atypical year - you talk about people going and making weird and exciting stuff in their bedrooms or studios but we’ve not been able to see much of it this year. So, I mean, are we going to have an exhibition of the most-liked works on Instagram?' - Hettie Judah  </div>

Frances tells him why we’re looking in the wrong places for Lawrence’s greatness, explains why the supposed prophet of sexual liberation wasn’t really interested in sex at all - and reveals that after his death Lawrence may have been eaten by his admirers.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In this week’s episode of The Green Room, Deputy Editor of The Spectator's world edition Dominic Green meets the author Sohrab Ahmari for a chat about his new book, <em>The Unbroken Thread: Discovering The Wisdom Of Tradition In An Age Of Chaos</em>.<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>In it, Ahmari, a writer and <em>New York Post</em> op-ed editor, makes a compelling case for seeking the inherited traditions and ideals that give our lives meaning, via 12 fundamental questions that challenge our modern certainties. Among them: Is God reasonable? What is freedom for? What do we owe our parents, our bodies, one another? Exploring each question through the life and ideas of great thinkers, from Saint Augustine to Howard Thurman and from Abraham Joshua Heschel to Andrea Dworkin, Ahmari invites us to examine the hidden assumptions that drive our behaviour and, in so doing, to live more humanely in a world that has lost its way.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>China has run wild with facial recognition. From using it to ration tissues in public toilets, to identifying highest paying customers in stores and criminals from a crowd, what is a budding technology in the West has furthered state surveillance and corporate snooping in China. But there is a civil fightback happening in the courts, on social media and in public opinion at large. On this episode, I speak to Jeffrey Ding, a DPhil researcher of China's development of AI at the University of Oxford, and Jeremy Daum, Senior Research Scholar in Law at Yale Law School, who also runs the blog <a href="https://www.chinalawtranslate.com/en/">China Law Translate</a>. We discuss who is driving the tech growth in China; whether citizens have any recourse to turn back the tide; and how this technology is being used in Xinjiang.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In this week’s podcast, we talk to <em>The Spectator</em>'s editor Fraser Nelson and associate editor Douglas Murray about the challenges facing a freshly re-elected SNP. What next for Nicola Sturgeon - full steam ahead for IndyRef2? Or have neither Scotland or Number 10 the bottle for an all-out battle for independence? [01:02]<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>
<em>‘When you look at the practicalities, the case for independence really does fall. Nicola Sturgeon is selling it in the abstract: “Do you feel Scottish”?’</em> - Fraser Nelson<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>Meanwhile in matters of social etiquette, the new post-pandemic era looms, complete with new modes of social interactions and conversational topics. In this week’s magazine, Rachel Johnson lays down the new laws of conversational topics - sex, art and travel is fine; kids, vaccines and masks are most definitely not. She joins us now, along with Lucy Hume, from that venerable arbiter of taste and decorum, Debrett’s, for some ideas for the upcoming social summer. [12:25]<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>'I sometimes got emails from people, during lockdown, saying, I’m on my way to my second house, can you confirm this is legal or not, as if I was the ultimate arbiter of the crazy compliance and Covid restrictions!' - Rachel Johnson<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>Finally, as the government announces its plans to introduce new asset thresholds for households seeking healthcare in old age, Leo McKinstry writes in <em>The Spectator</em> this week of his irritation with middle-class homeowners scandalised at the prospect of selling their homes to finance healthcare in their old age. Should this be a cost collectively borne by the taxpayer or should those with ample assets simply bear the brunt of the cost? Will Heaven, Director of Policy and Communications at the Policy Exchange think tank, joins us to argue the point. [23:00]<br>
<br>

</div>
<div>'I think if you were to tell most 40-year olds that you’re going to pay one penny extra on income tax over the course of your career but you’re never going to have to worry about high social care costs and parents and grandparents, they’d probably go for it' - Will Heaven.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In this week's Book Club podcast, we're celebrating the 80th birthday of Bob Dylan. Sam Leith's guests are the former Poet Laureate Andrew Motion, and Clinton Heylin, the Dylanologist's Dylanologist and author most recently of <em>The Double Life of Bob Dylan: A Restless Hungry Feeling 1941-66. </em>Sam asks what makes Dylan special, whether what he does - even if we admire it - can be called literature, how Dante and Keats found their way into his work, whether there's anything he does badly (spoiler: yes); and if it can really be true that he writes songs with a typewriter rather than a guitar. </div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>If it hadn't been for the pandemic, the past year would have likely been dominated by a familiar topic - Brexit. The decision to leave, we're told, presents the UK with endless opportunity in a variety of sectors, including healthcare and life sciences. But it hasn't been the easiest year, with supply chains and the Northern Ireland Protocol already under strain. So what are the opportunities to boost Britain's healthcare now that it has left the EU, and where are the pitfalls?<br>

Kate Andrews is joined by Antonis Papasolomontos, Director of External Affairs at Abbvie, Sarah Neville, Global Health Editor at the FT, and Jeremy Hunt, Chair of the Health Select Committee.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>In this week’s podcast, we talk to the author of our cover story, eminent author, historian and broadcaster Niall Ferguson, who says that the West and China are in the throes of a new cold war. Joining the debate is Chatham House's Dr Leslie Vinjamuri. (01:05)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Next up, Laura Freeman writes in the magazine this week about the fake facades she has been increasingly noticing whilst out and about in London. She discusses the topic with architectural expert Samuel Hughes, a Senior Fellow at Policy Exchange think tank. (10:20)</div>
<div> </div>
<div>Finally, as the Prime Minister considers how he’ll stump up the cash to pay for little Wilfred’s babysitter, Isabel Oakeshott writes in the magazine this week about the struggle many working parents have in affording childcare. Isabel is joined by the Labour MP Stella Creasy as they debate what needs to be done so working parents can ensure their children get the care they need. (15:35)<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Sam's guest in this week's Book Club podcast is the writer and critic Ruth Scurr, whose new book marks today's 200th anniversary of Napoleon's death to cast a fresh light on this most written-about of characters. In <em>Napoleon: A Life in Gardens and Shadows</em>, she finds an unexpected thread running through the life of this man of war - his relationship with nature and with gardens, from the plot he tended as a schoolboy to the garden in his final exile in St Helena. She tells Sam about what he owed the Revolution and how he came to turn it, at least apparently, on its head; about his complex relationship with Josephine and its Boris-and-Carrie echoes; and about the single walled garden on which the future of Europe can be argued to have turned.  </div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Covid has put a spotlight on housing in Britain - the inequalities, the challenges, but also the opportunities. As what we want out of our homes, offices, and even the high street, changes, public policy will have to follow suit. So how do we create sustainable towns and cities that ensure quality and access for all?<br>

Kate Andrews is joined by Christopher Pincher, Minister for Housing, Iqbal Hamiduddin, Associate Professor at the Bartlett School of Planning at the UCL, and Kath Fontana, President of the Royal Institute of Chartered Surveyors (RICS).<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>The archaic-sounding notion of 'filial piety' has little direct translation into English, but is a deep-rooted part of Chinese culture and ethics. On this episode, I find out about what motivates the subscription to such an unequal view of family life; how modernity changes expectations (and in particular, the impact of the one child policy); and what happens to those deemed by society to be disrespectful of their parents.<br>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Over the last year of intermittent lockdowns, most of us have spent more time staring at the four walls of our living room than we ever thought possible. One of the biggest factors affecting someone's pandemic experience is the type of accommodation they're in, and 8.4 million people in England are living in unaffordable, insecure or unsuitable homes.</div>
<br>
<div>There are, however, attempts being made to help fix the problem, with promises to build new homes, a stamp duty holiday, and a new mortgage guarantee system.</div>
<br>
<div>To discuss the problem of unaffordable homes, and the potential solutions, Katy Balls is joined on this sponsored podcast by Thangam Debbonaire, the shadow secretary of state for housing; Natalie Elphicke, the Conservative MP for Dover and chair of the New Homes Quality Board; and Esther Dijkstra, the managing director of intermediaries at Lloyds Banking Group.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>Hwaet! Our guest in this week’s Book Club Podcast is Maria Dahvana Headley, whose new book is a translation of the Anglo-Saxon classic <em>Beowulf</em>. She talks to us about how she has produced what she bills as a 'feminist translation' of this most macho of poems; about the poem’s braided history and complex language; and about what it tells us of the Anglo-Saxon worldview.</div>

  <description><![CDATA[<div>You might think that in a country as tightly controlled as China, diversity of opinion is hard to come by in written form. But as I find out in this episode, there is a vibrant conversation going on with vastly different views, especially in the intellectual elite amongst professors and journalists. So what do these intellectuals think, and how much can they get away with saying?<br>
<br>
With Professor David Ownby, who founded the website <a href="https://www.readingthechinadream.com/">Reading the China Dream</a>, which translates writings from Chinese intellectuals into English. He tells me:<br>
<br>
<em>'A casual observer of China in the West will think that all Chinese are sitting at home, with the blinds closed, waiting for the Chinese Communist Party to fall apart before the police come and get them... But that's not the life led by most Chinese intellectuals... By knowing what they talk about, it humanises China.'</em><br>
<br>
In the episode, we also discuss Cai Xia, a former CCP professor now living in exile, and the article she wrote from the US. Click <a href="https://www.foreignaffairs.com/articles/china/2020-12-04/chinese-communist-party-failed">here</a> to read it.</div>

Roland's story describes her heroic early work; and its undoing when she was captured and turned collaborator... before she saw, in the figure of an agent for the British secret services, the opportunity for a triple-cross and the hope of redemption.</div>
