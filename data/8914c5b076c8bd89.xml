      <title>Civil rights leader meets with Elon Musk; Who really writes celebrity memoirs?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Ahead of midterm voting ending on Tuesday, both President Biden and former President Donald Trump held rallies to motivate voters to cast their ballots. ABC News political director Rick Klein and USA Today White House correspondent Francesca Chambers join us to talk about what issues are driving voters this election season. Then, as Elon Musk takes over as head of Twitter, he faces pressure to combat hate speech and misinformation on the platform. Rashad Robinson, president of the civil rights nonprofit Color of Change, met with Musk and joins us. And, according to estimates by some in the industry, nearly 95% of celebrity memoirs aren't written by the person on the cover. So who is penning these autobiographies? Ghostwriters who remain nameless but make a hefty profit off the projects, for the most part. <em>Here & Now</em>'s Grace Griffin reports. ]]></description>

      <title>Biden calls out 2020 election lies; The most-read journalist you've never heard of</title>
      <description><![CDATA[In a prime-time speech to the American public, President Biden called out lies about the 2020 presidential election that have led to political violence. But is that enough to embolden Democratic voting blocs like young and Black voters to turn out at the polls? Peniel Joseph, director of the University of Texas Center for the Study of Race and Democracy, joins us. Then, as midterm elections approach, five states have slavery on the ballot. In Alabama, Louisiana, Oregon, Tennessee and Vermont, loopholes exist that allow for the forced labor of incarcerated citizens, and voters will weigh in on whether to remove them from state constitutions. Christina Carrega, a national criminal justice reporter for Capital B News, joins us. And, "Listen, World!," a new book from Allison Gilbert and Julia Scheerer explores the life of Elsie Robinson, a prolific journalist and columnist born in the early 1900s. She became the most-read woman in America, though many didn't know her name. Author Gilbert joins us. ]]></description>

      <title>Only 5% to 6% of plastics get recycled; 'Anthems We Love' and why we love them</title>
      <description><![CDATA[As the U.S. Supreme Court hears two cases involving affirmative action in relation to college admissions, the Washington Post found that the lawyers arguing cases in front of the Justices are mostly white and male. WAPO's Tobi Raji joins us. Then, a new Greenpeace report shows that only 5% to 6% of plastics in the U.S. are recycled. The report also concludes that plastics are "fundamentally not recyclable" and calls for the petrochemical industry to end the narrative that places blame on individual consumers instead of the corporations producing so much plastic. Lisa Ramsden, senior plastics campaigner at Greenpeace, joins us. And, the right song can lift us up and make us feel alive. How have some anthems — like "ABC" by the Jackson 5 or "God Only Knows" by the Beach Boys — transcended decades, remaining popular the whole time? Music journalist Steve Baltin spoke to some of the hitmakers for his new book "Anthems We Love: 29 Iconic Artists on the Hit Songs that Shaped our Lives," and joins us. ]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[A new bulletin warns of a heightened "domestic violent extremist threat" in the final days of this midterm election cycle and following the outcome. Robert Pape, director of the University of Chicago Project on Security and Threats, has been tracking the potential for domestic political violence since the Jan. 6 attack on the U.S. Capitol. Then, Chelsea Manning tells her story in a new memoir, "README.txt." The book goes from her struggles with gender as a child to being charged with 22 counts related to the unauthorized possession and distribution of classified material. And, happy Halloween! In the last two years, witches spelled over into romance novels — making contemporary romance just a little bit more magical. <em>Here & Now</em>'s Kalyani Saxena reports.]]></description>

      <title>Confusion abounds over DeSantis' voting fraud arrests; 'Outlander' star's memoir</title>
      <description><![CDATA[In Florida, a video shows police arresting 19 people accused of committing voter fraud. A 2018 state constitutional amendment restored the right to vote to many felons, but not those convicted of murder or felony sex offenses, leading to confusion over who was eligible. Neil Volz, deputy director of the Florida Rights Restoration Coalition, joins us. Then, human-made threats are responsible for the decline of nearly half of bird species. One in eight species is threatened with extinction, according to a new report, and birds tell us a lot about the state of the environment and the health of the planet. Stuart Butchart, a chief scientist at BirdLife International and a co-author of the report, joins us. And, Sam Heughan may not be too similar to his "Outlander" character Jamie Fraser, but he has a tale of his own journey to tell. The actor documents his hike of Scotland's West Highland Way while reflecting on his personal life and acting career. "Waypoints: My Scottish Journey" comes out on Oct. 25 and Heughan joins us. ]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[As midterm elections approach, absentee ballots are a source of contention in Wisconsin. The number of mail-in ballots skyrocketed during COVID-19 and some used that as a way to spread baseless claims of voter fraud and call for changes to the election process. Here & Now's Chris Bentley reports. Then, human rights advocates in Ukraine, Russia and Belarus were awarded Nobel Peace Prizes. All three recipients oppose Russian and Belarusian state rule and Russia's ongoing war with Ukraine. NPR's Rob Schmitz joins us. And, we try to settle a staff-wide debate about whether brunch is just an over-hyped breakfast or truly the best meal of the weekend. Farha Ternikar, author of "Brunch: A History," joins us to talk about brunch's cultural significance. ]]></description>

      <itunes:summary><![CDATA[As midterm elections approach, absentee ballots are a source of contention in Wisconsin. The number of mail-in ballots skyrocketed during COVID-19 and some used that as a way to spread baseless claims of voter fraud and call for changes to the election process. Here & Now's Chris Bentley reports. Then, human rights advocates in Ukraine, Russia and Belarus were awarded Nobel Peace Prizes. All three recipients oppose Russian and Belarusian state rule and Russia's ongoing war with Ukraine. NPR's Rob Schmitz joins us. And, we try to settle a staff-wide debate about whether brunch is just an over-hyped breakfast or truly the best meal of the weekend. Farha Ternikar, author of "Brunch: A History," joins us to talk about brunch's cultural significance. ]]></itunes:summary>

      <title>Conspiracies enter Wisconsin midterms; Disaster relief for underserved communities</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Despite the claims of voter fraud propelled by former President Donald Trump that were wholly unfounded, widespread distrust in the election process lingers in Wisconsin. Here & Now's Chris Bentley reports from Green Bay about the election officials and poll workers trying to restore trust in the system. Then, underserved communities were disproportionately impacted by hurricane Ian, and many wonder how disaster relief will get to them. Former Tampa emergency manager and CEO of the Institute of Diversity and Inclusion in Emergency Management, Chauncia Willis, joins us. And, OPEC+, or the Organization of the Petroleum Exporting Countries, announced plans Wednesday to cut oil production by 2 million barrels per day. This comes amid security concerns around the Nord Stream pipeline. Andreas Eriksen, Norway's State Secretary for Petroleum and Energy, joins us. ]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[As Hurricane Ian bears down on Florida, residents in several counties are under an evacuation order. Hillsborough County Fire Chief Dennis Jones describes how local residents are preparing for the region's biggest hurricane in 101 years. Then, University of Pennsylvania Wharton School of Business professor Jeremy Siegel explains why the Federal Reserve's policy of hiking interest rates could lead to a major recession.

      <title>How Arizona and other states are moving to restrict abortion access; Protests in Iran</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Russian protestors are still demonstrating following President Vladimir Putin's announcement last week of troop mobilization. More than 100 protesters have already been detained. We learn more with NPR's Charles Maynes. Then, we get an Iran news roundup with <em>Here & Now</em> security analyst Jim Walsh. Protests continue in the country over the death of a woman held in police custody for not wearing a headscarf. And, we talk about the latest in state abortion rules: An Arizona judge allowed a state law that bans nearly all abortions. Washington Post health reporter Rachel Roubein joins us. Plus, more details are coming to light about a welfare fraud scandal that funneled money to former NFL player Brett Farve, among others. Mississippi Today reporter Anna Wolfe tells us more. ]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Congress wants documents from the EPA about the clean up of toxic waste sites, including the Stringfellow Acid Pits in Glen Avon, California. But Gorsuch won't hand them over. Soon she's in the political hot seat and becomes the first Cabinet-level official to be held in contempt of Congress. And Lavelle is about to get into even more trouble, no thanks to the EPA staffers who have been keeping records, taking notes and are ready to testify. ]]></description>
