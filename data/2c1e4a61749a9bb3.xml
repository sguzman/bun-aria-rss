      <title>Texting Tutor PT 1: She Needs To Break Some Bad News To The Guy She's Dating</title>
      <description>You’re conflicted. But you just don’t KNOW how to approach your problem…especially if you’re not a confrontational person. So sometimes, you just need a little help addressing the situation – and that’s where we come in! We’ll tell you what to text the person, line by line, and we’ll help you resolve the problem…but you have to PROMISE to write EXACTLY what we tell you to.
Up this week - she needs to tell the guy she's been dating for just a few weeks that she's moving out of state for a job...but she doesn't want to break things off. Can we convince him to do long distance?

      <title>War Of The Roses PT 1: Is Her Boss Cheating On Her?!</title>
      <description>We used to do a bit called “War of the Roses” back in the day where we’d pretend to be a florist, call a guy who was allegedly cheating, tell him he won a free bouquet of roses, and ask him who he wants to send them to. If he picked his wife, yay!…but if he picked some other girl to send the flowers to…well then, there’s your cheating proof.
We loved doing it, BUT…we had to stop doing it because of new laws and a bunch of other technicalities around recording people, etc., whatever, but we found a loophole: E-MAIL.
Not only is she dating her boss, she thinks he's being unfaithful! Is someone else in the office catching his eye? We'll find out!

      <title>Sip Or Spill: Can Moe Handle These Tough Questions?</title>
      <description>We took a page out of “Real Housewives” creator Andy Cohen’s book from his late-night talk show, “Watch What Happens Live.” and are stealing his game “Plead The Fifth”!
We’ve given five tough questions to answer, and we’re only allowed to skip ONE – a.k.a. “Pleading the Fifth.” But today, we’re switching the game up a bit. Instead of pleading, we have to sip something super gross!
Moe in the hot-seat today!

      <title>War Of The Roses Update: She's Afraid Her Husband Is Doing Something Odd</title>
      <description>We used to do a bit called “War of the Roses” back in the day where we’d pretend to be a florist, call a guy who was allegedly cheating, tell him he won a free bouquet of roses, and ask him who he wants to send them to. If he picked his wife, yay!…but if he picked some other girl to send the flowers to…well then, there’s your cheating proof.
We loved doing it, BUT…we had to stop doing it because of new laws and a bunch of other technicalities around recording people, etc., whatever, but we found a loophole: E-MAIL.
From their first date, her husband made it clear that he does not tolerate infidelity. However lately he's been very distant, and she thinks he's the one cheating. Is her feeling right? We'll find out!

They've been happily married for 7 years and most recently started experimenting with having an open marriage.
They gave one another a few rules, but one of the major rules that they gave each other was to do absolutely nothing other than the physical.

She reached out to The Bert Show for help finding out if her husband is cheating in their open marriage.

      <title>Second Date Update PT 2: Did She Do Something Offensive On Their Date?</title>
      <description>Here’s how second date update works: you had a first date, it was great, you think a second one is coming…and then out of nowhere, they drop you. No second date, no nothing. But things were going SO WELL – what happened?!
Fiona met a guy online, and they ended up meeting for a date. She thought the date went well even though she drank more than she expected. The date ended with a kiss, and that's the last she heard from him.
The next day she went to message him, and his account was gone. Now she's wondering what she did wrong for him to ghost her.

      <title>War Of The Roses: She's Afraid Her Husband Is Doing Something Odd</title>
      <description>We used to do a bit called “War of the Roses” back in the day where we’d pretend to be a florist, call a guy who was allegedly cheating, tell him he won a free bouquet of roses, and ask him who he wants to send them to. If he picked his wife, yay!…but if he picked some other girl to send the flowers to…well then, there’s your cheating proof.
We loved doing it, BUT…we had to stop doing it because of new laws and a bunch of other technicalities around recording people, etc., whatever, but we found a loophole: E-MAIL.
From their first date, her husband made it clear that he does not tolerate infidelity. However lately he's been very distant, and she thinks he's the one cheating. Is her feeling right? We'll find out!

      <title>Second Date Update: Did She Do Something Offensive On Their Date? </title>
      <description>Here’s how second date update works: you had a first date, it was great, you think a second one is coming…and then out of nowhere, they drop you. No second date, no nothing. But things were going SO WELL – what happened?!
Fiona met a guy online, and they ended up meeting for a date. She thought the date went well even though she drank more than she expected. The date ended with a kiss, and that's the last she heard from him.
The next day she went to message him, and his account was gone. Now she's wondering what she did wrong for him to ghost her.

      <title>The One That Got Away PT 1: She Wants To Test Her Husband's Loyalty</title>
      <description>The One That Got Away: it’s been years since you’ve seen them. You moved on with your life, but there’s that one person who you still consider as the “one who got away.” We’ll track them down and find out what’s going on in their life…and if they’re thinking of you, too!
In this case, she's not looking for her "one that got away." Instead, she wants to test her husband. She's wondering how he would react if his ex reached out to him. Is this a bad idea? We think so.

      <title>To Catch A Cheater PT 2: This Mom Thinks Her Son Is Cheating On His Wife (Who Just Had His Baby!)</title>
      <description>You think your significant other is cheating, but you’re not certain. We’ll put them to the test! We’re ready to set the trap and go on Instagram (well, we’d send Kristin’s friend on Instagram) to try to lure him into doing something inappropriate so we could expose him as the dirty cheater he is (or, to be fair, expose him as the great guy and partner that he is).
Today's "To Catch A Cheater" has a twist - this time, it's not a wife that wants to catch her husband cheating...instead, it's a MOM who thinks her SON is cheating on his wife (the wife that he just had a baby with!)

      <title>New Update: He's A Millionaire And His Girlfriend Has NO Idea!</title>
      <description>He is rolling in dough, like, really, millions of dollars worth; and to anyone else, this would be great news, but for our listener, he’s worried that this news could really make or break his relationship simply because he’s been with his girlfriend for a year and has yet to tell her.

A few years ago, our listener's grandfather passed away and, in his will, he left millions of dollars for him and his brothers.

Apparently, his family status is so major, everyone in the state of Pennsylvania knows about them… aside from his girlfriend.

Our listener never wanted his financial status to be the reason that someone dates him, so, for a year, he hid this secret from his girlfriend in hopes of keeping their relationship authentic.

Well, it worked and now they’re in love, like, really in love, but he thinks spilling the beans on this one thing will really turn things around for the worse.
THE UPDATE:Now that we've heard more of behind the scenes, this whole strategy of being "frugal" isn't quite sitting so well with us...

      <title>He's Getting Messages From Beyond The Grave!</title>
      <description>Who's listening who thinks they're receiving messages from people beyond the grave? There's no judgement at all, and in fact, one of our own thinks that he's been receiving messages from his grandmother who passed on. And before you write it off, you gotta hear what happened because it's pretty creepy (but in a good way!)

      <title>To Catch A Cheater: This Mom Thinks Her Son Is Cheating On His Wife (Who Just Had His Baby!)</title>
      <description>You think your significant other is cheating, but you’re not certain. We’ll put them to the test! We’re ready to set the trap and go on Instagram (well, we’d send Kristin’s friend on Instagram) to try to lure him into doing something inappropriate so we could expose him as the dirty cheater he is (or, to be fair, expose him as the great guy and partner that he is).

Today's "To Catch A Cheater" has a twist - this time, it's not a wife that wants to catch her husband cheating...instead, it's a MOM who thinks her SON is cheating on his wife (the wife that he just had a baby with!)

Today's "To Catch A Cheater" has a twist - this time, it's not a wife that wants to catch her husband cheating...instead, it's a MOM who thinks her SON is cheating on his wife (the wife that he just had a baby with!)

      <title>Her Brother-In-Law Is Walking In On Her In The Bathroom...On Purpose!</title>
      <description>This woman and her husband had an agreement that when they started living together, there would be no locks on any doors in their house and that they'd never lock each other out of any room. Sounds weird, but hey, if it works for them, who is anyone else to judge, right?

The problem is that now, his brother - her brother-in-law - who is going through a divorce is staying with them...and he won't stop walking in on her in the bathroom.

It's not a mistake, because it never happens to her husband and it's happened to her...MULTIPLE times. He's even walked in on her in her BEDROOM - a place he has zero reason to be.

She's mentioned it to her husband, but he hasn't done anything about it. So, she warned him that next time it's happening, she's installing a lock on the bathroom door. Shocker, it happened again, so she installed the lock. When her husband found it, he blew up...AT HER?!

      <title>Kristin's Jaw Dropped When She Saw This Pic Of One Of Her Husband's Exes</title>
      <description>Yesterday on the show, we talked to a listener who was creeped out after finding out his exes looked like her exact doppelgängers! And while we were talking about what our significant other's exes look like, it came out that Kristin had NEVER seen any of Bart's exes, so she had no idea what they looked like.
Well, Bart sent us the names of some of her exes and our Social Media Producer Rebecca did some hardcore internet sleuthing...and found them. We're gonna reveal them to Kristin for the first time EVER...while we're live on the air!

      <title>AITA: Is She The A*Hole For Threatening To Call The Cops On Her Sister?</title>
      <description>Every week we dive DEEP into the AITA (Am I The A*hole) thread on Reddit, and it’s FASCINATING.
It’s a bunch of real-life scenarios people are in where they could EASILY be the a*hole, but maybe – just maybe – once you hear all the details, you’ll understand it a little better and they won’t be SO much of an a*hole! Or maybe not.
Up today: is she the a*hole for threatening to call the police on her sister if her sister doesn't return a family heirloom?

      <title>Shady or Not: She's Auditioning Guys To Be Her Thanksgiving Date!</title>
      <description>Shady or Not: you tell us what's going on in your life, and we'll tell you whether or not it's shady...or totally legit.
This time around, our LISTENER is the one who might just be shady. The holidays are coming up and she wants to take a guy home for Thanksgiving because she's tired of being the only single one at her aunt's house. All of her siblings and cousins have boyfriends or spouses and she feels like she's always being judged or pitied. Normally, by the end of the night, there has been enough alcohol consumed that people stop biting their tongues and conversation around the table includes "when is Heather going to find a guy..." or "will Heather be single forever." That said, she doesn't want to bring home just anyone.  
She's been dating 2 guys and she likes them both, but she's not at a serious or exclusive point in my relationship with either of them. She definitely wants to invite one of them to join me for Thanksgiving. Since it involves a
decent amount of travel, she doesn't feel like this is something that can be a last minute decision. She also wants to ask whichever guy she picks in enough time for him to have not decided on his own Thanksgiving plans.   
All that said, her real question is... is it wrong or shady of her to basically be auditioning these guys for her Thanksgiving date?

      <itunes:summary>Shady or Not: you tell us what's going on in your life, and we'll tell you whether or not it's shady...or totally legit.
This time around, our LISTENER is the one who might just be shady. The holidays are coming up and she wants to take a guy home for Thanksgiving because she's tired of being the only single one at her aunt's house. All of her siblings and cousins have boyfriends or spouses and she feels like she's always being judged or pitied. Normally, by the end of the night, there has been enough alcohol consumed that people stop biting their tongues and conversation around the table includes "when is Heather going to find a guy..." or "will Heather be single forever." That said, she doesn't want to bring home just anyone.  
She's been dating 2 guys and she likes them both, but she's not at a serious or exclusive point in my relationship with either of them. She definitely wants to invite one of them to join me for Thanksgiving. Since it involves a
decent amount of travel, she doesn't feel like this is something that can be a last minute decision. She also wants to ask whichever guy she picks in enough time for him to have not decided on his own Thanksgiving plans.   
All that said, her real question is... is it wrong or shady of her to basically be auditioning these guys for her Thanksgiving date?

      <title>Update: She Accidently Catfished Him And IS Scared To Tell The Truth!</title>
      <description>I think we all can agree that catfishing is just disrespectful. Someone creates a fake social media account to pretend to be someone else in hopes of beginning a deceitful relationship; doesn’t that just sound downright evil?
But what if someone does it by accident, does it count? And what if they’re ready to come clean about the whole thing and see where destiny takes them, should the catfishee go out with them anyway?!

      <description>We used to do a bit called “War of the Roses” back in the day where we’d pretend to be a florist, call a guy who was allegedly cheating, tell him he won a free bouquet of roses, and ask him who he wants to send them to. If he picked his wife, yay!…but if he picked some other girl to send the flowers to…well then, there’s your cheating proof.

      <title>Bro Code Violation? He Wants To Date His Friend's Sister!</title>
      <description>Our Bert Show listener doesn’t seem to be familiar with the bro code. He’s been out of the dating pool for a while and thinks that he could be a little rusty with the rules of the whole thing. He’s familiar with the bro code being a thing of his teenage memory, however, he isn’t sure if the rules still apply in his 20s.

      <title>War Of The Roses: Is This Man Lying About Being Single?</title>
      <description>We used to do a bit called “War of the Roses” back in the day where we’d pretend to be a florist, call a guy who was allegedly cheating, tell him he won a free bouquet of roses, and ask him who he wants to send them to. If he picked his wife, yay!…but if he picked some other girl to send the flowers to…well then, there’s your cheating proof.
We loved doing it, BUT…we had to stop doing it because of new laws and a bunch of other technicalities around recording people, etc., whatever, but we found a loophole: E-MAIL.
She just started dating a man that she thinks is great. But before they go on their first date she wants to verify that he is truly single.

      <title>Update: Just Romeo's High School Teacher Asked Him To Do The Scariest Thing Ever!</title>
      <description>His drama teacher called asking him if he could do a small 5-minute speech for Hispanic heritage month in September!
He thinks it’s almost weird that he enjoys the nervousness he gets from things like this. First his college last year, Moe for his comedy show, and now this! Well, we guess it’s his way of being an adrenaline junkie!
When Just Romeo was in high school the ratio was 50% Latinos, 40% Blacks, and 10% others. A lot of the students then and now are either undocumented or recipients of the Dream Act scholarship just like Romeo.
“.. they want me to come in and pretty much motivate these kids who don’t want to go to college and they’re looking at these kids right now and they think that high school is it. They don’t see the motivation in these students to want to pursue higher education.”
So, of course, with so much pressure on Just Romeo to rise to the occasion of motivating the students, Bert gives him some sound advice that has help him when he has to public speak.
“Sometimes I have to do this also, man, some of this a fight with ego. This isn’t about you, man. It’s not about how well you're gonna do. It’s not if you’re gonna, like, present something. Maybe you’ll stumble over a word. You are going to be touching a whole bunch of kids that normally wouldn’t have this kind of perspective. It’s about them, so keep your focus there.”

      <title>AITA: Is He An A*Hole For Being Upset About How His Wife Spends Her Money?</title>
      <description>Every week we dive DEEP into the AITA (Am I The A*hole) thread on Reddit, and it’s FASCINATING.
It’s a bunch of real-life scenarios people are in where they could EASILY be the a*hole, but maybe – just maybe – once you hear all the details, you’ll understand it a little better and they won’t be SO much of an a*hole! Or maybe not.
Up today: His wife spends her money shopping and he's not happy about it. Why? Because since he bought a car, he doesn't have money left over to spend on fund things. Does this make him an a*hole?

      <title>Update: He Wants To Link Up With His Former Mistress?! </title>
      <description>You know what they say, Insanity is doing the same thing over and over again expecting a different result; that same thing is true for our listener’s husband.
Wendy has been married for a total of one month and is ready to call things quits. Her husband is going to dinner with the woman he had an affair with in his last marriage!
Of course, he claims that they’re only friends and that Wendy has nothing to worry about, but seriously, whom does he think he’s fooling; at least that’s what Moe says.
“He clearly doesn't want to be married! Why do you keep getting married and then running back to this woman? This is one of the situations where somebody will say "It's not that easy." Of course, it's not, it is never easy to leave someone, but I am leaving... ONE HUNDRED PERCENT!”
Kristin on the other hand would handle things a little bit differently.
“I'm pissed too and I agree with everything you said, however, I am not leaving. We're a month into this marriage, when he gets home, be like "we need to talk." and I expressed how I felt and you still went. That was your one and only time to go out to dinner with her. This is how I feel, I need you to respect that and not turn this around on me; and then if he's adamant that he's gonna go out with her again, that's your chance to bow out.”
To make matters worse, he completely manipulates the situation and accuses our listener of being controlling, and threatened to leave her over this.
Her husband has no intention of missing this dinner, leaving Wendy so very confused. So, she reached out to the Bert show for advice.

This wasn't the first time that his dad had done this, but our listener wanted it to be the last.

They’ve been together for 7 years and after 3 of those years, with no doubts in his mind, he proposed.
Usually, when someone proposes, they’re expecting, and, for the most part, certain that the person they’re proposing to will say yes.

      <title>Update: We Can't Believe How Much Weight Tommy Has Lost Already!</title>
      <description>Yesterday, Tommy agreed to lose 80 lbs. by Christmas to get $2,050, and it seemed to upset a lot of people.
A Bert Show listener said "Don’t do this Tommy. Seriously, try a healthier way. The minute I read this I felt sad for you. That is a full-time, #biggestloser style goal. Can you not just get paid for every pound you lose
between now and then and celebrate that, without making unhealthy challenges for content?"
Money will make almost anyone do almost anything. And for Tommy that “thing” is to lose weight.

A Bert Show listener said "Don’t do this Tommy. Seriously, try a healthier way. The minute I read this I felt sad for you. That is a full-time, #biggestloser style goal. Can you not just get paid for every pound you lose
between now and then and celebrate that, without making unhealthy challenges for content?"
Money will make almost anyone do almost anything. And for Tommy that “thing” is to lose weight.

      <title>Update: The Dating Question You Need To Ask Your Partner!</title>
      <description>If you’re starting to get serious with someone right now, there’s one question you need to ask.
A while ago, Cassie, our executive vice president, I gave us all the questions you should be asking all your matches on Tinder, Hinge, and Bumble.
Now, Cassie shares with us the follow-up question for when things are getting
more serious.
This question would work for couples in relationships/married too:
What’s the one thing a partner needs to know about you in order for you to be happy?
For Kristin, someone would need to know that she needs validation. "I struggle with that, so I need words of affirmation and validation from my partner." 
Bert loves being in a committed relationship but also needs to feel independent.
Moe needs his peace, and Cassie needed to be respected as an equal.
If that question is a bit too intense for you then ask:
What's the one thing your best friend would tell someone you're dating about you?
The Bert Show answers that question and for homework, their friends have to answer!

      <title>Texting Tutor Update: She Wants To Have Lunch With Her Ex-Boyfriends New Wife?!</title>
      <description>Lane and her ex-boyfriend Tod became platonic friends after their relationship ended; shortly after he got married to a woman named Trish.
Now, the issue isn’t that he got married to Trish or that he even got married at all; the issue is that all of her friends and everyone around her is married and she can’t seem to hold onto a relationship for longer than six months.
She reached out to The Bert Show because she wanted our help asking Trish to go out to lunch with her, not to hang out and be friends but to pick her brain about what she did to get married.

      <title>Her Boyfriend Left Her For Their Happily Married Co-Worker And Now Their Spreading Rumors </title>
      <description>Both her ex-boyfriend and the co-worker deny that they have anything going on and when she asked the co-worker about their relationship, she asked our listener if she and the guy were even a couple.
This entire situation is really updating our listeners, even more so because the two have been bullying and spreading rumors about her. She could possibly put this entire thing to a stop but she’s not sure if it’s what’s best. Should she tell the co-worker’s husband the truth?

      <title>She Blames Her Mom For Her Parents' Divorce?! </title>
      <description>Mallory’s parents are getting a divorce, and not only does she think they’re making a big mistake, but she also thinks that her mother is to blame.
When her parents told her and her brothers, they were in complete shock. To their knowledge, they had no idea that their parents were unhappy and to Mallory, this all just seems to be coming out of nowhere.
After doing some research on divorce and divorce at age 50 + Mallory is starting to wonder whether the divorce has something to do with hormonal changes her mom may be facing.
Mallory asked The Bert Show for advice from women her mom’s age on whether they have experienced divorce and if so, what was the cause.

      <title>War Of The Roses: Is He Sneaking Around With His Coworker?</title>
      <description>This isn’t the first time he cheated, it’s just the first time in a long time that he’s been caught.
She contacted The Bert Show years back when his loyalty first became an issue, but things had worked themselves out, and she no longer needed us.
It’s been a few years since the original incident, her husband was offered a promotion that came with a move out of state, she’s gotten connected with some great friends and she found a job that she loves, but, for the past couple of months, things have been a little weird.
Her husband has been working late on important projects and also working a lot on weekends. Of course, this gave her some reserve, considering his history with infidelity but she tries to leave those thoughts behind.
She recently found out that the old coworker he cheated on her with the first time just relocated to a position in the state they moved to, and here’s the kicker, she’s been working there for the past couple of months and he never told her.

      <title>The Dating Question You Need To Ask Your Partner! </title>
      <description>If you’re starting to get serious with someone right now, there’s one question you need to ask. A while ago, Cassie, our executive vice president, I gave us all the questions you should be asking all your matches on Tinder, Hinge, and Bumble.
Now, Cassie shares with us the follow-up question for when things are getting more serious, and this question would work for couples in relationships/married, too:
What’s the one thing a partner needs to know about you in order for you to be happy?
Nice question, right? But what do you say if that question is a little too straightforward? Listen!

      <title>The One That Got Away - PT 3: Is He Willing To Reunite After 10 Years?</title>
      <description>Eva told the Bert show that she and Jason dated 10 years ago. Jason has kids and at that time they were eight and nine years old. She had just graduated from grad school and after working hard at school and work for so many years, she wanted to have fun and wasn’t in that position. So she broke up with him.
Shortly after, she regretted it realizing she made a mistake. She tried to get back with him, but he opted not to give her another chance for fear of the effect it’ll have on the kids if she decided to bail out again.
10 years pass by and in that time, Eva had gotten married, had a kid, and is now divorced. She thinks about Jason all the time and wonders what might have been. She asked The Bert Show to help her contact him and confirm that he is single and see if he would be interested in talking to her again.

      <title>Kristin Is A Comedian?! + We Weren't Prepared To Answer These Personal Questions</title>
      <description>Kristin got the opportunity to use a Twitter joke out in public this week and it didn’t disappoint.
Kristin was at the grocery picking up some medicine. There weren’t many cashiers available, so Kristin found herself in a long line. A guy in the store gets frustrated with the long lines and lack of service and begins yelling in the store making others uncomfortable.
While Kristin is leaving, she sees that same guy getting into his Tesla.
Kristin recently came across a Twitter joke instructing people to say the silliest thing to Tesla owners to make them upset.
This was the perfect opportunity for Kristin. She felt that since the guy was being an a*hole to the store employees, she’d do the same and push his buttons a little. You’d never guess what she said to him!

      <title>Texting Tutor PT 2: She Wants To Have Lunch With Her Ex-Boyfriends New Wife?!</title>
      <description>Lane and her ex-boyfriend Tod became platonic friends after their relationship ended; shortly after he got married to a woman named Trish.
Now, the issue isn’t that he got married to Trish or that he even got married at all; the issue is that all of her friends and everyone around her is married and she can’t seem to hold onto a relationship for longer than six months.
She reached out to The Bert Show because she wanted our help asking Trish to go out to lunch with her, not to hang out and be friends but to pick her brain about what she did to get married.
The Bert Show, however, didn’t think that it was necessary for Lane to meet Trish for lunch and all agreed that it wouldn’t end well.
Cassie encouraged Lane to take a moment and enjoy her singleness “You’re not broken just because you’re single, and just because you’ve had a lot of relationships that haven’t manifested into marriages.”
Timing is a major topic often discussed on The Bert Show, and to Bert, there’s nothing wrong with Lane, she just hasn’t met the right person and it’s just not the right time. “If you want us to text and try to get you this lunch we can do that, I just think all of us in here don’t think it’s really going to accomplish what you want, and frankly I just think that right dude hasn’t come along yet and chances are you’re not doing anything and if you are, you’re not gonna get that from the ex-boyfriend’s new wife.”
So, instead of doing Texting Tutor for Lane, The Bert Show asked her a few questions about herself and encouraged interested listeners to reach out for a date with Lane.

Timing is a major topic often discussed on The Bert Show, and to Bert, there’s nothing wrong with Lane, she just hasn’t met the right person and it’s just not the right time. “If you want us to text and try to get you this lunch we can do that, I just think all of us in here don’t think it’s really going to accomplish what you want, and frankly I just think that right dude hasn’t come along yet and chances are you’re not doing anything and if you are, you’re not gonna get that from the ex-boyfriend’s new wife.”
So, instead of doing Texting Tutor for Lane, The Bert Show asked her a few questions about herself and encouraged interested listeners to reach out for a date with Lane.

      <title>Texting Tutor PT 1: She Wants To Have Lunch With Her Ex-Boyfriends New Wife?!</title>
      <description>Lane and her ex-boyfriend Tod became platonic friends after their relationship ended; shortly after he got married to a woman named Trish.
Now, the issue isn’t that he got married to Trish or that he even got married at all; the issue is that all of her friends and everyone around her is married and she can’t seem to hold onto a relationship for longer than six months.
She reached out to The Bert Show because she wanted our help asking Trish to go out to lunch with her, not to hang out and be friends but to pick her brain about what she did to get married.
The Bert Show, however, didn’t think that it was necessary for Lane to meet Trish for lunch and all agreed that it wouldn’t end well.
Cassie encouraged Lane to take a moment and enjoy her singleness “You’re not broken just because you’re single, and just because you’ve had a lot of relationships that haven’t manifested into marriages.”

      <title>Our Interns Mackenzie and Hayden Drop The Mic on Their Last Day Raps!</title>
      <description>Mackenzie and Hayden are interns and today is their last day at The Bert Show. Hayden, who’s a senior at Ole Miss University is not happy about leaving and feels like she just started her internship. “It feels like it literally took place within the span of a very long week, and now it’s over, and now I have to go back to being uncool!”
Mackenzie on the hand loves school and is excited to return back to UGA for her last week. “I am excited to go back… we talked last week about how I have a little bit of anxiety about leaving school; I would very much like to stay in school, it’s like my comfort zone, but yea, I’m very excited to start my last year.”
In honor of their leaving, The Bert Show asked them to find a beat and write a “Last Day Rap” talking about their experience at The Bert Show.

      <title>Shady Or Not Update: She Thinks He Shared Her Phone Location Without Her Knowledge </title>
      <description>She’s always wanted a guy who was caring and protective, but never did she think that would lead her to send us this email – but you know what they say; be careful what you ask for!
She’s been dating this guy for only a month and thinks he shared her phone location with himself without her knowing.
Earlier this week she was on her phone and noticed in the contact for the guy she’s dating, it said “stop sharing my location”. She said that she checks her other contacts to see if she was sharing her location with others and it shows that she wasn’t. However, she doesn’t remember sharing her location with him.
She spoke with her best friends about it, and they all seem to be divided on whether this can be considered shady or sweet.
To both Bert and Moe, this is the epitome of shady! He without a doubt thinks the guy shared her location with himself and is creepy and controlling for doing that. To only having been dating for a month, Bert says the first shady move he made was picking up her phone.
Kristin recalls a moment when she accidentally shared her location with her husband. “It is plausible, that you could accidentally do that yourself, because I, myself have done that, however, I think his follow-up statement… I think that was a damming statement on his part, but he more than likely when on a did it himself, which is creepy…”

      <title>UPDATE: They Want Sweet Revenge On This Serial Cheater</title>
      <description>Cheater, cheater, pumpkin eater! What do you do if you find out that the person you’re in a relationship with has been cheating on you with four other people?
She met Shmeve through a trusted friend, so she only expected great things from him. They only dated for two months before he suddenly broke up with her. His excuse: “Your kids are just too much for me.”
Before the breakup, she noticed a few red flags that set off a light bulb in her mind. He had been getting text messages during all times of the day and night and never left his phone unattended. She’s going through her “red flags are really green flags” phase, so she ignored it.
A woman messaged her a few days after the breakup with some bad news. She tells her that she had been dating Shmeve for well over six months. She lives a few hours away and the last time he had come to see her he had used her phone to log into his Facebook account and that she still had his password.
She told our listener that she found three other women Shmeve had been dating and one woman he’s currently engaged to—all in different states. But it doesn’t stop there. He has a type! There were dozens of women, specifically “single moms who are a little chunky”, all over the country that he had been messaging.
So, they devise a plan, and the woman that messaged her is still maintaining her relationship with Shmeve to gather information. They knew that he would be going hunting with his brother. They know how much Shmeve loves his truck and are thinking they want to make him pay for the hurt he caused by hurting his truck.

      <title>Her Employee's Bra Was Showing, So She Sent Her Home?!</title>
      <description>Aside from the company’s policies, this manager has one rule and one rule only: Keep your underwear covered. Is she an a*hole for sending another woman employee home to change clothes?
She doesn’t tolerate visible underwear, and this is a known personal policy of hers enforced amongst all her employees. She sits behind this one employee and always sees her bra straps. Usually, she'll address it and then leave it alone but, on this day, our Bert Show listener had enough.
The employee wore a turtleneck sleeveless dress, one that reminded the manager of a dress she had of her own. However, her bra straps were showing, and the manager sent her home to change.
Would you have sent the employee home, or would you say the manager was being a bit anal?

      <title>It’s Been A Month Since This Bert Show Member Has Been On Medication</title>
      <description>For well over a month now Romeo has been seeing a therapist and taking Prozac to manage his anxiety and he says that his only regret is not going sooner.
He’s dealt with his parent’s negative views on therapy and medication for so long and those views and opinions played a huge part in his delayed decision to go—and for that reason alone, Romeo still has not told his parents.
The Bert Show is extremely proud of Romeo’s growth. Every day we see the result of the self-work Romeo has done to become a better person and for that, we congratulate him for his courage and resilience and for taking control of his life

      <description>Remember our listener, Jackie? Her sister has found her dream home and was ready to close on it. But there was a problem: the house was in Jackie's neighborhood. Her sister has no boundaries, and the last thing Jackie wanted is for her sister to move into her neighborhood.
So what has happened since we last spoke to her? We have an update!

      <title>The ABC Not So 80s Themed Birthday Party </title>
      <description>Picture this! You’re invited to an 80s themed party in your neighborhood, and you’re super excited up until you find out that this party may just be on the X-rated side.
One of K. Lee’s good friends mentioned that him and his wife were going to visit another couple that they haven’t seen in a few years.
The couple throwing the party had been doing really well for themselves, so they weren’t surprised when they got to the party, and it was in a multi-million-dollar house.
K.Lee’s friends go into the party and as expected, everything seemed normal. “People are on the main level just chilling in their 80s gear, and they start drinking and catching up – and they’re like “yea go check out what’s gong down in the basement.”
They go into the basement, and to their surprise, what they thought was an 80s theme birthday party turned into an Anything But Clothes (ABC) party.

      <title>Instagram Scam Update: She Doesn't Believe Her Husband Is Only Attracted To Her?!</title>
      <description>You think your significant other is cheating, but you’re not certain. We’ll put them to the test! We’re ready to set the trap and go on Instagram (well, we’d send Kristin’s friend on Instagram) to try to lure him into doing something inappropriate so we could expose him as the dirty cheater he is (or, to be fair, expose him as the great guy and boyfriend that he is).
In this case, she doesn't believe her husband is cheating. BUT she also doesn't believe he's not attracted to other women. Since they got together, he says he hasn't felt and emotional or sexual attraction for anyone else.
Is he telling the truth? We're going to find out.

      <title>People Never Marry The Person They Have The Best Bedroom Experience With?!</title>
      <description>Is it true that nobody marries their best bedroom experience ever?
According to a study by iVillage less than half of wedded women married the person who was the best bedroom experience of their lives (52 percent say that was an ex.) That same study shows that 66% of people would rather read a book, watch a movie or take a nap than to sleep with their spouse
Amanda Chantel (33) told the New York Post that she knows her greatest bedroom experience was temporary and because of that it was the best because that’s all the relationship could offer. “We didn’t have to invest in anything else.” that Women admits that it didn’t have the intensity that came with toxic relationships.
She adds that when it comes to the men she’s loved, the experience was good, sometimes ever great but the intensity that comes with her toxic relationships isn’t there.

      <title>Here's What's Grinding Moe's Gears This Week</title>
      <description>There are things in this world that really grinds Moe’s gears. This week Moe shares two things he’s most recently mad about. Starting with the poop pitching magician!
His friend invites a girl over for a first date. The girl needs to use the restroom, takes a poop and the toilet gets clogged. Long story short, the girl grabs a cup from out of the bathroom, scoops up the poop from the inside of the toilet and proceeds to throw the poop out the window into Moe’s friends back yard.
Moe’s friend asked her about it and you’d never believe what she told him!
Second on the list for what made Moe mad this week was Moe and Romeo’s unintentional twin day at The Bert Show. On Wednesday the two were dressed exactly alike, even down to their red underwear!
What upset Moe wasn’t the fact that they were matching, but the number of DMs Moe got of people asking him if it were planned.

      <title>Should Kristin Be Offended By What This Man Just Asked Her To Do?</title>
      <description>Something just went down off-air in the studio that has Kristin questioning one of our engineers. It started when he came into the studio and directly asked Kristin to clean off the table in the hallway.
At first, we thought nothing of the request. But then, we started to wonder... why did he ask the woman to clean the table and not the men?

      <title>No Dogs Allowed</title>
      <description>Our intern Hayden has a bit of a problem. She’s returning to school soon and her new roommate brought her dog without asking.
Her old roommate is pursuing her career and won’t be roommates with Hayden this year, so she puts out an ad for a new roommate to replace her.
Hayden is a clean freak and doesn’t like dog hair, so she was sure to disclosed in the ad her disinterest for a roommate with a dog. However, the new roommate applies anyway and sends a photo of her dog to Hayden hoping she’ll be ok with it. “Hey, I’m going to be your roommate…here’s my dog!”
Hayden never had any roommate issues before, so she’s uncertain how she should go about addressing the elephant in the room. She doesn’t want to ruin a possible friendship or cause tension within the apartment, but she does want to set a few boundaries.
What should Hayden do? How should address the issue?

      <description>Do you remember the very first boyfriend or girlfriend you’ve ever had? When was it? and how did it happen?
Our listener Maxi is in her senior year of high school, and she just got word from her parents that she is officially allowed to start dating,
All her friends have been dating already for some time now, but she never wanted them to know that she wasn’t allow to. She’s already one week into her last year of high school and is determined to make this year the best year yet.
There’s a new boy from Virginia that just started going to her school and he sits behind her in class. Maxi is extremely nervous. She’s never asked a guy out before and wants him to know that she’s interested.
Kristin suggested that Maxi arrange a group hang out with her friends and invite the new boy to join. That way, there’s not so much pressure, and he’ll be introduced to other people from school.
How would you approach the new boy?

      <title>Instagram Scam: She Doesn't Believe Her Husband Is Only Attracted To Her?!</title>
      <description>You think your significant other is cheating, but you’re not certain. We’ll put them to the test! We’re ready to set the trap and go on Instagram (well, we’d send Kristin’s friend on Instagram) to try to lure him into doing something inappropriate so we could expose him as the dirty cheater he is (or, to be fair, expose him as the great guy and boyfriend that he is).
In this case, she doesn't believe her husband is cheating. BUT she also doesn't believe he's not attracted to other women. Since they got together, he says he hasn't felt and emotional or sexual attraction for anyone else.
Is he telling the truth? We're going to find out.

      <title>AITA: Is He An A*Hole For Creating This Database Of Women At His University?</title>
      <description>Every week we dive DEEP into the AITA (Am I The A*hole) thread on Reddit, and it’s FASCINATING.
It’s a bunch of real-life scenarios people are in where they could EASILY be the a*hole, but maybe – just maybe – once you hear all the details, you’ll understand it a little better and they won’t be SO much of an a*hole! Or maybe not.
Up today: In college, he created a database about the women who attended his university. The database was full of information about these women's interests.
A friend of his wanted to add to the database, and from there, it spread to over 40 men. Is he wrong for creating this?

      <title>We Can’t Believe What Her Boss’ Response Was To Her Mental Day Request </title>
      <description>Death happens in your family and when you try to call off your boss tells you that you still must come to work – what do you do?
One of our listeners is a 21-year-old college student who recently quit her job at Starbucks after being told she couldn’t call out of work without penalty, even though she just lost her best friend.
Her family adopted Gandy when he was just a small puppy. The family finds out that Gandy had cancer, but because of Gandy’s age, there was nothing that could be done to help him.
When Gandy dies, the Bert Show listener sends a text to her boss letting him know that she is scheduled to work on the day they will be putting Gandy down, and as a result, she will be looking for someone to cover her shift and won’t be coming to work that day.
Her manager texts her back asking for her to put her dog down on a night she is not scheduled to work the next day. Her boss also tells her that if she calls out it won’t be approved because it is so short notice.
Shortly after that, she sends a text back including her two weeks notice that she will no longer be working for Starbucks.

      <title>Second Date Update - PT 1: Did He Ghost Her Because Of An Accidental AirDrop?</title>
      <description>Here’s how second date update works: you had a first date, it was great, you think a second one is coming…and then out of nowhere, they drop you. No second date, no nothing. But things were going SO WELL – what happened?!
Robin thought she hit it off with a guy she met at a party. While the two were talking her friend airdropped her number to the guy. A few days later, he asked her out for drinks.
But when they met for drinks, she could sense something was off. She hasn't heard from him since and wants to know why he ghosted her.

      <title>Sip Or Spill: We Can't Believe What Bert Just Took A Gulp Of! </title>
      <description>We took a page out of “Real Housewives” creator Andy Cohen’s book from his late-night talk show, “Watch What Happens Live.” We ended playing a game Plead The Fifth.
We're given five tough questions to answer, and we’re only allowed to skip ONE – a.k.a. “Pleading the Fifth.” But today, we're switching the game up a bit. Instead of pleading, we have to sip something very disgusting!
Bert's in the hotseat this morning!

      <title>To Catch A Cheater Update: She's Worried Her Boyfriend Is Distancing Himself For The Wrong Reasons</title>
      <description>You think your significant other is cheating, but you’re not certain. We’ll put them to the test! We’re ready to set the trap and go on Instagram (well, we’d send Kristin’s friend on Instagram) to try to lure him into doing something inappropriate so we could expose him as the dirty cheater he is (or, to be fair, expose him as the great guy and boyfriend that he is).
She hasn't been able to see her boyfriend because she's been working out of the state for the last month. During the first few weeks, her boyfriend made an effort to constantly reach out to her. But lately, he's been more unavailable than usual. Does this mean he's up to something sketchy?

      <title>To Catch A Cheater: She's Worried Her Boyfriend Is Distancing Himself For The Wrong Reasons </title>
      <description>You think your significant other is cheating, but you’re not certain. We’ll put them to the test! We’re ready to set the trap and go on Instagram (well, we’d send Kristin’s friend on Instagram) to try to lure him into doing something inappropriate so we could expose him as the dirty cheater he is (or, to be fair, expose him as the great guy and boyfriend that he is).
She hasn't been able to see her boyfriend because she's been working out of the state for the last month. During the first few weeks, her boyfriend made an effort to constantly reach out to her. But lately, he's been more unavailable than usual. Does this mean he's up to something sketchy?

      <title>AITA: Is He An A*Hole For Using His Lacrosse Skills For Revenge?</title>
      <description>Every week we dive DEEP into the AITA (Am I The A*hole) thread on Reddit, and it’s FASCINATING.
It’s a bunch of real-life scenarios people are in where they could EASILY be the a*hole, but maybe – just maybe – once you hear all the details, you’ll understand it a little better and they won’t be SO much of an a*hole! Or maybe not.
Up today: His neighbor lets her dog poop on his lawn WITHOUT cleaning up after her dog. He's over it and decided to take matters into his own hands. He created a poop flinger to throw the poop back into her lawn. Does this make him an a*hole or not? We discuss.

      <title>Shady Or Not: Is The Guy She's Dating Sweet Or Creepy For Doing *This* Online?</title>
      <description>You connected with someone, and you two started dating. But they’ve done something that makes you question their character. And now you’re not certain if you should continue dating them or not – and that’s where we come in! Tell us your situation, and we’ll tell you if their offense is shady or not.
The guy she's been dating for the last three weeks seemed normal to her until she started to research his social media profiles. She noticed that he was following all of her friends.
If he doesn't personally know her friends, why would he be following them? Is this a red flag or not?

      <title>War Of The Roses PT 4: She's Afraid Her Husband Is Making The Same Mistake She Made In The Past</title>
      <description>We used to do a bit called “War of the Roses” back in the day where we’d pretend to be a florist, call a guy who was allegedly cheating, tell him he won a free bouquet of roses, and ask him who he wants to send them to. If he picked his wife, yay!…but if he picked some other girl to send the flowers to…well then, there’s your cheating proof.
We loved doing it, BUT…we had to stop doing it because of new laws and a bunch of other technicalities around recording people, etc., whatever, but we found a loophole: E-MAIL.
Years ago, she cheated on her husband. It was a rough time for them, but they agree to work through their issues. Afterward, she noticed a change in her husband. He started working out more and getting more attention from women. Now she's afraid he's cheating on her. Is she right? We'll find out.

      <title>Sip Or Spill: Either We Answer These Questions Or Face A Disgusting Consequence!</title>
      <description>We took a page out of “Real Housewives” creator Andy Cohen’s book from his late-night talk show, “Watch What Happens Live.” We ended playing a game Plead The Fifth.
We're given five tough questions to answer, and we’re only allowed to skip ONE – a.k.a. “Pleading the Fifth.” But today, we're switching the game up a bit. Instead of pleading, we have to sip something very disgusting!

      <title>Are These Parents Wrong For Making Their Kid Prepare His Own Meals?</title>
      <description>This couple's 11-year-old kid wants to be vegetarian. The parents are supportive and will buy / prepare the food for the kid. But they're telling him he has to come up with the meal plans and figure out what he's gonna be eating.
Is it fair to ask a kid to do this? Or should the parents have to come up with two dinners for everyone?

      <title>War Of The Roses PT 3: She's Afraid Her Husband Is Making The Same Mistake She Made In The Past</title>
      <description>We used to do a bit called “War of the Roses” back in the day where we’d pretend to be a florist, call a guy who was allegedly cheating, tell him he won a free bouquet of roses, and ask him who he wants to send them to. If he picked his wife, yay!…but if he picked some other girl to send the flowers to…well then, there’s your cheating proof.
We loved doing it, BUT…we had to stop doing it because of new laws and a bunch of other technicalities around recording people, etc., whatever, but we found a loophole: E-MAIL.
Years ago, she cheated on her husband. It was a rough time for them, but they agree to work through their issues. Afterward, she noticed a change in her husband. He started working out more and getting more attention from women. Now she's afraid he's cheating on her. Is she right? We'll find out.

      <title>War Of The Roses Update: She's Afraid Her Husband Is Making The Same Mistake She Made In The Past</title>
      <description>We used to do a bit called “War of the Roses” back in the day where we’d pretend to be a florist, call a guy who was allegedly cheating, tell him he won a free bouquet of roses, and ask him who he wants to send them to. If he picked his wife, yay!…but if he picked some other girl to send the flowers to…well then, there’s your cheating proof.
We loved doing it, BUT…we had to stop doing it because of new laws and a bunch of other technicalities around recording people, etc., whatever, but we found a loophole: E-MAIL.
Years ago, she cheated on her husband. It was a rough time for them, but they agree to work through their issues. Afterward, she noticed a change in her husband. He started working out more and getting more attention from women. Now she's afraid he's cheating on her. Is she right? We'll find out.

      <title>War Of The Roses PT 3: She's Afraid Her Husband's Feelings For Her Are Starting To Change</title>
      <description>We used to do a bit called “War of the Roses” back in the day where we’d pretend to be a florist, call a guy who was allegedly cheating, tell him he won a free bouquet of roses, and ask him who he wants to send them to. If he picked his wife, yay!…but if he picked some other girl to send the flowers to…well then, there’s your cheating proof.
We loved doing it, BUT…we had to stop doing it because of new laws and a bunch of other technicalities around recording people, etc., whatever, but we found a loophole: E-MAIL.
She married a man six months after meeting him. She loves him and his kids, BUT she's worried he may be starting to stray. So she wants our help testing him.

      <title>AITA: Is She An A*Hole For Forcing Her Guest To Participate In Her Puppet-Themed Wedding?</title>
      <description>Every week we dive DEEP into the AITA (Am I The A*hole) thread on Reddit, and it’s FASCINATING.
It’s a bunch of real-life scenarios people are in where they could EASILY be the a*hole, but maybe – just maybe – once you hear all the details, you’ll understand it a little better and they won’t be SO much of an a*hole! Or maybe not.
Up today: Instead of wedding gifts, they asked their guest to buy puppets and wear them during the ceremony.

      <title>War Of The Roses Update: She's Afraid Her Husband's Feelings For Her Are Starting To Change</title>
      <description>We used to do a bit called “War of the Roses” back in the day where we’d pretend to be a florist, call a guy who was allegedly cheating, tell him he won a free bouquet of roses, and ask him who he wants to send them to. If he picked his wife, yay!…but if he picked some other girl to send the flowers to…well then, there’s your cheating proof.
We loved doing it, BUT…we had to stop doing it because of new laws and a bunch of other technicalities around recording people, etc., whatever, but we found a loophole: E-MAIL.
She married a man six months after meeting him. She loves him and his kids, BUT she's worried he may be starting to stray. So she wants our help testing him.

      <description>Her friends hooked her up with a guy she assumed was wealthy. On their first date, he went above and beyond to make her feel special. However on the second date, she noticed something strange.
Now she thinks he's pretending to be someone he isn't, but she's not upset about it. Should she tell him she knows the truth about who he's pretending to be? Or should she wait to see how long he keeps up this charade?

      <title>War Of The Roses: She's Afraid Her Husband's Feelings For Her Are Starting To Change </title>
      <description>We used to do a bit called “War of the Roses” back in the day where we’d pretend to be a florist, call a guy who was allegedly cheating, tell him he won a free bouquet of roses, and ask him who he wants to send them to. If he picked his wife, yay!…but if he picked some other girl to send the flowers to…well then, there’s your cheating proof.
We loved doing it, BUT…we had to stop doing it because of new laws and a bunch of other technicalities around recording people, etc., whatever, but we found a loophole: E-MAIL.
She married a man six months after meeting him. She loves him and his kids, BUT she's worried he may be starting to stray. So she wants our help testing him.

      <title>AITA: Is He An A*Hole For Hiding Something Of His Neighbors Because It Was Scaring His Son?</title>
      <description>Every week we dive DEEP into the AITA (Am I The A*hole) thread on Reddit, and it’s FASCINATING.
It’s a bunch of real-life scenarios people are in where they could EASILY be the a*hole, but maybe – just maybe – once you hear all the details, you’ll understand it a little better and they won’t be SO much of an a*hole! Or maybe not.
Up today: His son is terrified of their neighbor's gnome garden. Because of this, he asked if his neighbor could move the placement of their gnome. When they didn't, he decided to move the gnome himself. Does this make him an a*hole?

      <title>Should She Confront The Man She's Dating For Pretending To Be Someone He's Not?</title>
      <description>Her friends hooked her up with a guy she assumed was wealthy. On their first date, he went above and beyond to make her feel special. However on the second date, she noticed something strange.
Now she thinks he's pretending to be someone he isn't, but she's not upset about it. Should she tell him she knows the truth about who he's pretending to be? Or should she wait to see how long he keeps up this charade?

      <title>Texting Tutor PT 1: How Does She Tell Her Friend She's Dating The Man She Called Dibs On?</title>
      <description>You’re conflicted. But you just don’t KNOW how to approach your problem…especially if you’re not a confrontational person. So sometimes, you just need a little help addressing the situation – and that’s where we come in!
We’ll tell you what to text the person, line by line, and we’ll help you resolve the problem…but you have to PROMISE to write EXACTLY what we tell you to.
She's going on a date with a man her friend is interested in. Yes. her friend called "dibs" on this guy when she first saw him, but there's a problem. Her friend is already in a relationship with another man!
Her friend wants the guy she's crushing on to be her back up plan. So how do we tell her that our listener is going to date him instead?

      <title>War Of The Roses Update: She Wants Proof That Her Sister's Fiancé Isn't The Man He Says He Is</title>
      <description>We used to do a bit called “War of the Roses” back in the day where we’d pretend to be a florist, call a guy who was allegedly cheating, tell him he won a free bouquet of roses, and ask him who he wants to send them to. If he picked his wife, yay!…but if he picked some other girl to send the flowers to…well then, there’s your cheating proof.
We loved doing it, BUT…we had to stop doing it because of new laws and a bunch of other technicalities around recording people, etc., whatever, but we found a loophole: E-MAIL.
She absolutely HATES the man her sister is about to marry in a few weeks. She is certain that he is unfaithful and wants proof to help stop her sister from making a big mistake.
Can we help her? We'll try!

      <title>To Catch A Cheater: She Wants Proof That Her Sister's Fiancé Isn't The Man He Says He Is</title>
      <description>You think your significant other is cheating, but you’re not certain. We’ll put them to the test! We’re ready to set the trap and go on SnapChat (well, we’d send Kristin’s friend on SnapChat) to try to lure him into doing something inappropriate so we could expose him as the dirty cheater he is (or, to be fair, expose him as the great guy and boyfriend that he is).
She absolutely HATES the man her sister is about to marry in a few weeks. She is certain that he is unfaithful and wants proof to help stop her sister from making a big mistake. 
Can we help her? We'll try!

      <title>We Need Your Help Clearing This Music Teacher's Wish List! </title>
      <description>Teachers - The Bert Show wants to help clear your wishlist! And if you're looking for today's wish list, scroll down!
Do you have an Amazon wishlist of supplies you need for your students or classroom? Call 1-844-827-8368 and leave us a voicemail telling us about yourself, what grade you teach (and give a shout out to your school if you want!), a general idea about your needs, and why we should highlight your wishlist.
If selected, we will put your list out there to our Bert show fam and we can all help you "Clear The List!"
Once again, that number is 1-844-827-8368. Call and leave us a message!
JENNIFER WITTER FROM STEELTON-HIGHSPIRE ELEMENTARY
Jennifer is a music teacher with something on her list that is a rite of passage for every elementary school kid!
She is hoping to build a collection of recorders, the equivalent of two class sets, for use in her 3rd and 4th grade music classes.
A recorder is the most cost efficient, most accessible first instrument for a child to learn the basics of rhythmic and musical notation skills that can be carried for a lifetime.
Will you please help Jennifer Witter out by buying one or two items off her classroom wish list? THANK YOU Bert Show Fam!

This triggered all of her irrational fears, and she quickly realized I have a lengthy list. Is this a sign it's time for her to start anxiety meds?

      <title>AITA: Is She An A*Hole For Correcting Her Coworker About Where Milk Comes From?</title>
      <description>Every week we dive DEEP into the AITA (Am I The A*hole) thread on Reddit, and it’s FASCINATING.
It’s a bunch of real-life scenarios people are in where they could EASILY be the a*hole, but maybe – just maybe – once you hear all the details, you’ll understand it a little better and they won’t be SO much of an a*hole! Or maybe not.
Up today: Where do you think chocolate milk comes from? In this woman's case, her coworker legit thought it only came from brown cows. She corrected her but got in trouble at work because of it. Does this make her an a*hole?
