They certainly are in the battleground state of Wisconsin, where the last two presidential elections were decided by very thin margins.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[ On Friday, federal authorities issued an internal bulletin that warned of the potential for violence from domestic extremists during the midterm election season.<br/><br/>The same day, a federal Judge in Phoenix refused to stop a group from patrolling outdoor ballot boxes. Members of the group have been showing up heavily armed, often masked and wearing tactical vests. Critics say this is intimidating voters.

      <title>Brazil's Presidential Vote Could Have An Impact Beyond The Country's Borders</title>
      <description><![CDATA[On Sunday, Brazilians will go to the polls to choose between two very different presidential candidates. One is the far-right incumbent, Jair Bolsonaro, who has been called Latin America's Trump. The other is leftist former president and working class icon, Luiz Inacio Lula da Silva.<br/><br/>The outcome of the presidential runoff vote will of course shape the future of Brazil's democracy. But the vote's impact could also be felt far beyond the country's borders.<br/><br/>We hear what the outcome could mean for the future of the Amazon rainforest and efforts to prevent catastrophic climate change. And then, NPR's Shannon Bond explains why conspiracy theories about Brazil's elections are circulating in the United States.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>.]]></description>

      <title>Is Britain's Political Turmoil a Lesson in Democracy for the U.S?</title>

      <title>What A Third Term For Xi Jinping Could Mean For China And The World</title>
      <description><![CDATA[This week, China's Communist Party Congress is expected to approve a historic third term in office for the country's leader, Xi Jinping. <br/><br/>Xi has already been in power for a decade, a period marked by growing authoritarianism in China. Many experts believe he could emerge a more emboldened leader in his new term. <br/><br/>Ailsa Chang speaks with Yun Sun, director of the China Program at the Stimson Center, about the global implications of a third term for Xi Jinping and how this signals a new era for China. And NPR's Emily Feng reports on how little we know about the way China's Communist Party Congress makes its decisions.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>.]]></description>

      <title>How PPP Loan Forgiveness Became a Messy Process with Limited Scrutiny</title>
      <description><![CDATA[The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) was designed to soften the financial impact of the pandemic for small businesses. It issued about $800 billion in potentially forgivable government loans to keep workers employed during COVID shutdowns. <br/><br/>Now, the overwhelming majority of those loans have been forgiven with very little scrutiny. That means many loans have been forgiven to businesses that flourished during the pandemic or to fraudsters who took advantage of the lax system.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the majority of the loans that remain unforgiven belong to the smallest businesses, companies the program was most meant to help.<br/><br/>Sacha Pfeiffer and Austin Fast of NPR's Investigations team looked into how the program failed to be as stringent as the government promised.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>. ]]></description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[The Paycheck Protection Program (PPP) was designed to soften the financial impact of the pandemic for small businesses. It issued about $800 billion in potentially forgivable government loans to keep workers employed during COVID shutdowns. <br/><br/>Now, the overwhelming majority of those loans have been forgiven with very little scrutiny. That means many loans have been forgiven to businesses that flourished during the pandemic or to fraudsters who took advantage of the lax system.<br/><br/>Meanwhile, the majority of the loans that remain unforgiven belong to the smallest businesses, companies the program was most meant to help.<br/><br/>Sacha Pfeiffer and Austin Fast of NPR's Investigations team looked into how the program failed to be as stringent as the government promised.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>. ]]></content:encoded>

      <title>What Does a Record Number of Black Candidates Really Mean for Republicans?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[In a party not known for ethnic diversity, 22 Black candidates are running for Republican House seats this year.  And for the first time, we could see two Black Republican senators serving simultaneously. The historically diverse lineup also includes Latinos, Asians, and Native Americans on Republican tickets for the midterms.  <br/><br/>While some Republican see a shift toward Ronald Regan's vision of the party as an inclusive "Big Tent''. But others say that the party's problematic record on race continues to keep Black voters away - even those who consider themselves conservative.  <br/><br/>Host Michel Martin talks to Theodore Johnson, a researcher, and writer whose work focuses on how race plays out in politics and policy.

      <title>Does The U.S.-Saudi Alliance Have A Future?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[President Biden met with Saudi Arabia's Crown Prince Mohammed bin Salman this summer — a man he had previously accused of ordering the killing of journalist Jamal Khashoggi. But at the meeting, he met the Crown Prince with a fist bump. <br/><br/>It all came as gas prices were rising globally, under pressure from Russia's war in Ukraine. One of Biden's goals was to convince Saudi Arabia's leaders to increase oil production. <br/><br/>But this month, Saudi Arabia and the other oil producing countries of OPEC Plus decided to cut production by 2 million barrels a day. That move is expected to drive up gas prices, and put more money in Russia's pockets. It has prompted Democrats in Congress to call for the U.S. to rethink or even walk away from its seven-decade partnership with Saudi Arabia.<br/><br/>NPR's International Affairs  Correspondent <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/2100981/jackie-northam">Jackie Northam</a> reports on where the relationship may be headed.<br/><br/>And Sen.

      <title>The Supreme Court Case That Will Decide if Voting Rights Should Be Race-Blind</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Last week, the Supreme Court heard opening arguments in Merrill v. Mulligan, a case that could gut the Voting Rights Act of 1965 for the third time this decade. <br/><br/>At the center of the debate is Alabama's new congressional maps. Black voters make up the majority of only one out of seven districts. More than a quarter of the state's population is Black. <br/><br/>A three-judge federal panel ruled that Alabama should create a second congressional district. The state appealed, arguing that congressional maps shouldn't take race into consideration, and the case is now in front of the Supreme Court. <br/><br/>Eric Holder was the U.S. attorney general during the first case that weakened the Voting Rights Act: Shelby County v. Holder. He is now in the middle of this latest fight as the chair of the National Democratic Redistricting Committee, which supports the plaintiff in the Alabama case. He shares with us the potential impact of this case and where the fight for voting rights goes if the Voting Rights Act receives yet another body blow.  <br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>. ]]></description>

      <title>Prescribed Burns Started a Wildfire, But Experts Say They're A Crucial Tool</title>
      <description><![CDATA[After a prescribed burn became the largest wildfire in New Mexico history earlier this year, the U.S. Forest Service put a ninety day ban on controlled burns.<br/><br/>But while these kinds of burns do carry risk, very few escape, and they are a crucial tool in reducing the risk of catastrophic wildfires. Forest ecologists are worried the ban added to the wildfire risk in areas that desperately need maintenance.<br/><br/>An investigation by CapRadio and the California Newsroom found that proper fire mitigation could have protected the Northern California town of Grizzly Flats from the Caldor Fire last year.

      <title>As Mortgage Rates Climb, A Hot Housing Market Cools</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Higher mortgage rates are putting a damper on the U.S. housing market. Home prices are down and sales of existing homes have now fallen for seven months in a row.<br/><br/>The ripples in the housing market are being felt as the Federal Reserve has been raising interest rates to fight inflation. And those higher borrowing costs mean that monthly mortgage payments have shot up. <br/><br/>We hear from would-be buyers who say that soaring mortgage rates are pushing them out of the market. And we talk to NPR's Chris Arnold about how the Fed's moves are affecting buyers and sellers. <br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a> <br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>. ]]></description>

      <title>The Experiment Aiming To Keep Drug Users Alive By Helping Them Get High More Safely</title>
      <description><![CDATA[As record numbers of people in the U.S. die from drug overdoses, communities are searching for tools to prevent them. A new program in Canada could serve as a model.<br/><br/>Over the past few years, government-approved clinics have opened across the country, where people can use street drugs under medical supervision. If they overdose, they can get life-saving care immediately. Some doctors are even prescribing powerful opioids to patients to keep them from using street drugs that may be laced with deadly chemicals.<br/><br/>It's a controversial program, and some in the medical community argue that it could encourage drug use.<br/><br/>NPR's addiction correspondent Brian Mann visited some of those supervised injection sites in Ottawa, to see how the program is working.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a> <br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>. ]]></description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[As record numbers of people in the U.S. die from drug overdoses, communities are searching for tools to prevent them. A new program in Canada could serve as a model.<br/><br/>Over the past few years, government-approved clinics have opened across the country, where people can use street drugs under medical supervision. If they overdose, they can get life-saving care immediately. Some doctors are even prescribing powerful opioids to patients to keep them from using street drugs that may be laced with deadly chemicals.<br/><br/>It's a controversial program, and some in the medical community argue that it could encourage drug use.<br/><br/>NPR's addiction correspondent Brian Mann visited some of those supervised injection sites in Ottawa, to see how the program is working.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a> <br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>. ]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Britain And Its Former Colonies Debate The Monarchy's Future After Elizabeth </title>
      <description><![CDATA[For many in the United Kingdom, Queen Elizabeth was synonymous with the monarchy. As she's laid to rest, King Charles faces a potentially "existential" challenge in convincing the British and global public that the monarchy is a force for good, according to historian Dan Jones.<br/><br/>That may be a difficult task in the Commonwealth, a group of 56 countries connected in part by a history of British colonial rule. Many see the monarchy as inextricably linked to the injustices of that colonial system. <br/><br/>Jones talks to NPR's Rachel Martin about the Queen's legacy and the shoes Charles must now fill.<br/><br/>Jamaican member of Parliament Lisa Hanna explains why she believes the monarchy is at a crossroads and must use this moment to correct historical wrongs committed by the British Empire against people of the Caribbean.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>. ]]></description>

      <title>Does Social Media Leave You Feeling Angry? That Might Be Intentional</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Social media platforms have helped fuel political polarization and incitements to violence across the globe, from the Rohingya genocide in Myanmar to the January 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.<br/><br/>This is because algorithms consistently select content that evokes anger and outrage from its users to maximize engagement. And sometimes, those extreme emotions turn into extreme actions.<br/><br/>New York Times reporter Max Fisher took a deep dive into the impact of social media in his book, "The Chaos Machine: The Inside Story of How Social Media Rewired Our Minds and Our World." He shares with us how platform leaders have prioritized profit and growth over safeguards and how the polarizing effect of social media is only speeding up.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>. ]]></description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Social media platforms have helped fuel political polarization and incitements to violence across the globe, from the Rohingya genocide in Myanmar to the January 6 insurrection at the U.S. Capitol.<br/><br/>This is because algorithms consistently select content that evokes anger and outrage from its users to maximize engagement. And sometimes, those extreme emotions turn into extreme actions.<br/><br/>New York Times reporter Max Fisher took a deep dive into the impact of social media in his book, "The Chaos Machine: The Inside Story of How Social Media Rewired Our Minds and Our World." He shares with us how platform leaders have prioritized profit and growth over safeguards and how the polarizing effect of social media is only speeding up.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>. ]]></content:encoded>

They're brought in trucks in big pieces, then screwed together and put up on foundations. <br/><br/>At that point they're basically just houses, with one major exception: the people who own those houses, if they live in a mobile home park, often don't own the land underneath them.<br/><br/>That can leave them at the mercy of the big companies that own and manage the mobile home parks.<br/><br/>NPR's Chris Arnold and Robert Benincasa have the story of a group of residents who are suing their corporate landlord, and what it might say about the mobile home industry in America.<br/><br/>You can read an in-depth version of the story <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/08/21/1112299858/from-floods-to-slime-mobile-home-residents-say-landlords-make-millions-neglect-t">here</a>.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community. </a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>. ]]></description>

      <title>When Fashion Is About More Than Trendy Clothes</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Even if you have never walked the red carpet at the Met Gala, or sat in the front row of a Fashion Week runway, the notion of <em>fashion</em> is hard to escape. For some of us, what we wear – whether it's Gucci or the GAP–is about more than just the clothes on our bodies. <br/><br/>Fashion is often about who we are - our ideas, identity, and culture. For those who cover and create fashion, it can be a way to challenge and change the culture in ways that resonate beyond the red carpet and the runway. <br/><br/>Host Michel Martin speaks with designer Eileen Fisher, one of the first in the industry to introduce sustainable clothing production. She is stepping down as CEO of her self named company after 34 years. Kenya Hunt is stepping into the editor-in-chief role at Elle UK. She is the first Black woman to hold the position. Hunt talks about why she chose Lizzo for the magazine's September cover. <br/><br/>In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community. <br/><br/>Email us at considerthis@npr.org.<em>This episode was produced by Robert Baldwin III.

      <title>Quiet Quitting: A Loud Trend Overtaking Social Media</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Quiet quitting. It's a buzzy topic in the workplace and on social media, sparked by a viral TikTok video earlier this summer.

For others, it's about setting boundaries and focusing on work-life balance. <br/><br/>Quiet quitting doesn't actually involve quitting a job.

      <title>To attract and retain teachers, some schools are getting creative</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Across the country, some teachers are deciding not to return to the classroom this September. The pandemic didn't create the problem of teacher burnout, but it made a bad situation worse. Fed up with low pay, hampered by partisan politics intruding in the classroom, and shaken by the recent Uvalde shooting, many say they have reached their breaking point. <br/><br/>Teacher vacancies have left school districts across the U.S. scrambling to find enough qualified faculty for the fall. In some areas, competition for teachers is fierce, and schools are finding creative ways to hold on to existing teachers and attract new talent.<br/><br/>Host Don Gonyea speaks with John Kuhn, Superintendent of Mineral Wells Independent School District in Texas, about the bold changes he made to retain teachers. ]]></description>

      <title>Trying To Heal The Wounds Of Partition, 75 Years Later</title>
      <description><![CDATA[75 years ago this week, British colonial rule ended in India. Two new nations emerged - Muslim-majority Pakistan and Hindu-majority India.  <br/><br/>But that freedom was followed by chaos and bloodshed.

An estimated one million people were killed. <br/><br/>Pakistan and India still grapple with the repercussions of Partition and the effects are still felt today. <br/><br/>NPR's <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/463861805/lauren-frayer">Lauren Frayer </a>tells us about an effort to heal some of those old wounds by reconnecting elderly survivors of Partition with the homes and villages they haven't seen in decades.  <br/><br/>Additional reporting in this episode from NPR's <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/536641200/diaa-hadid">Diaa Hadid</a>.<br/><br/>You can read more about Diaa and Lauren's reporting on this story <a href="https://www.npr.org/2022/08/12/1115419350/youtube-videos-helping-reunite-loved-separated-india-pakistan-border-partition">here</a>.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at considerthis@npr.org. ]]></description>

      <title>Where Does Liz Cheney Go From Here?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[A key primary this week in Wyoming re-affirmed Donald Trump's hold on the Republican party.<br/><br/>As expected, Republican Representative Liz Cheney lost her race in a landslide, defeated by attorney Harriet Hageman, a Trump-endorsed political newcomer. <br/><br/>Cheney, daughter of former Vice President Dick Cheney, came to office five years ago as a Republican darling. But everything shifted when she voted to impeach Trump after the January 6th insurrection. She then took center stage in the January 6th hearings, speaking out against Republicans that continued to defend Trump's stolen election lie.<br/><br/>With Cheney's time in Congress coming to an end, Political journalist Jodi Edna has been thinking about what Cheney might do next — and what it means for the future of the GOP. <br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at considerthis@npr.org. <br/>]]></description>

      <title>How The Family Separation Policy Came To Be</title>
      <description><![CDATA[In 2018, more than 5,500 children of immigrants were separated from their parents at the border.<br/><br/>The Trump administration's "Zero Tolerance" policy, better known as family separation, was short-lived, ending in June of 2018 after facing condemnation from the public and members of Congress.<br/><br/>For some families, it took years to reunite, and hundreds of families still have not been brought back together.<br/><br/>Caitlin Dickerson's latest cover story for <em>The Atlantic</em>, titled, <em>"We Need To Take Away Children: The Secret History Of The U.S. Government's Family Separation Policy",</em> is an exhaustive investigation into how the policy came about.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at considerthis@npr.org. ]]></description>

But in the decades following the legal dismantling of segregation, enrollment declined at HBCUs.<br/><br/>Recently, some HBCUs have seen a significant rise in applications. The boost could be due to more funding, celebrity students, or famous HBCU grads like Vice President Kamala Harris. <br/><br/>But informal conversations with Black students and their families point to something even more powerful: HBCUs are a safe and nurturing space to learn in a time of increasing anti-Black racism.<br/><br/>Host Michel Martin speaks with Walter Kimbrough, the past president of two historically Black institutions - Philander Smith College and Dillard University - and the interim executive director of the Black Men's Research Institute at Morehouse College. <br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>. ]]></description>

      <title>Palestinian pop singer Bashar Murad struggles for freedom and equality on two fronts </title>
      <description><![CDATA[Bashar Murad's danceable riffs and live concerts and videos - filled with bubbles, enormous hats, and layers and layers of veils - have earned him the nickname "Palestinian Lady Gaga" from his fans. And much like <em>Born This Way </em>is an anthem of equality, Murad's songs challenge conservative social norms and push for LGBTQ rights while also challenging the Israeli occupation of the West Bank. <br/><br/>Earlier this summer, Murad's concert in the West Bank city of Ramallah was cancelled under threats by anti-LGBTQ activists. As an outspoken proponent of LGBTQ rights, Murad is challenging both the external conflict Palestinians face with Israel and the internal conflicts imposed by a conservative society. <br/><br/>This week, NPR's Daniel Estrin speaks with Bashar Murad about his music, his activism, and how anti-LGBTQ events that unfolded during the summer have added to the complexities that can come with being a voice for both the Palestinian and the LGBTQ communities.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment that will help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a> <br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>.  ]]></description>

      <title>In Canada, The Pope Delivers An Apology To Indigenous Peoples</title>
      <description><![CDATA[This week, Pope Francis has been in Canada, on what he calls a "Pilgrimage of Penance". He's been going around the country to apologize for the Catholic Church's role in Canada's residential school system.  <br/><br/>These schools – funded by the Canadian government and administered by the Catholic Church – were aimed at erasing the culture and language of indigenous people.  <br/><br/>The apology from Pope Francis this week comes after years of allegations detailing abuse and neglect at these residential boarding schools. Canada's Truth and Reconciliation Commission was established in 2008 to document what happened at these schools – and the lasting trauma that has followed. <br/><br/>Stephanie Scott is a member of the Anishinaabe from Roseau River First Nation. She's executive director of the National Center for Truth and Reconciliation – and has been part of a years-long effort to gather the testimony of survivors. She shares with us the mixed feelings about the Pope's apology, and the work that still has to be done towards reconciliation.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>.]]></description>

      <title>How To Protect Yourself From The BA.5 Omicron Subvariant</title>
      <description><![CDATA[The BA.5 variant is the most dominant strain of COVID-19 in the country, according to the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention. It's highly transmissible and it's driving up COVID cases and hospitalizations. <br/><br/>This week NPR learned that the Biden administration may scrap plans to let more younger adults get second COVID-19 boosters this summer. Instead, officials are trying to speed up availability of the next generation of boosters in the fall — boosters that specifically target the new subvariant. <br/><br/>We talk to Dr. Robert Wachter, the chair of the Department of Medicine at the University of California, San Francisco, about the administration's booster strategy and how people can protect themselves in the midst of the latest surge. <br/><br/>This episode also features reporting from NPR's <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/146944972/rob-stein">Rob Stein</a>.<br/><br/><em>A heads up to listeners: we recorded this episode Thursday afternoon, before the Biden administration announced that it will hold off on offering boosters for people under 50 this summer.</em><br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>.]]></description>

As inflation hit a 40-year high last month, millions of Americans are adjusting their spending and looking for ways to stretch their budgets. <br/><br/>The Federal Reserve is taking action, too.

      <description><![CDATA[This week dozens of family members of victims of the Uvalde Texas school shooting showed up at the town's first school board meeting since a gunman killed 19 students and two teachers in May.<br/><br/>The atmosphere became tense and emotional as families confronted board members, demanding assurances that students and staff would be safe in the coming school year.<br/><br/>The school board meeting followed the release of surveillance footage from the day of the shooting and an investigative report released by the Texas House of Representatives.<br/><br/>The investigation found that a total of 376 local, state, and federal officers converged on the scene. But due to "systemic failures and egregiously poor decision making" on the part of the police, more than an hour passed before anyone confronted the gunman. <br/><br/>Many Americans feel that the police stand between order and chaos. Yet the massive failure by law enforcement in Uvalde may change how the public views police and how police view themselves.<br/><br/>NPR's Michel Martin speaks with Seth Stoughton, a professor at the University of South Carolina School of Law.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at considerthis@npr.org. ]]></description>

      <title>In A Divided America, Can The January 6 Hearing Change Hearts And Minds?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[The televised probe into the mob attack on the Capitol has dropped plenty of bombshells as insider testimonies pull back the curtain on the efforts of former President Donald Trump and his allies to hold onto power after he lost his reelection bid. <br/><br/>But at Tuesday's hearing, one of the most compelling witnesses was not a former staffer or official but Stephen Ayers. A staunch believer in Trump, Ayers came to D.C. on Trump's command and stormed the Capitol. After his arrest, he looked at the facts about the 2020 election and realized he was fed and had believed a lie.<br/><br/>Polls, studies and surveys warn that Americans are deeply  and bitterly divided by politics. Can the January 6 hearing help close that partisan gap?  We speak with Didi Kuo, Associate Director for Research at Stanford University's Center on Democracy, Development and the Rule of Law. <br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>. ]]></description>

      <title>What We Learned From This Week's Jan. 6 Hearing — And What Questions Still Remain</title>
      <description><![CDATA[In a tweet sent on December 19, 2021, former President Trump issued what Democrats now say was a "clarion call" to his supporters. "Big protest in D.C. on January 6th," he wrote. "Be there, will be wild!" This week, in a hearing of the House committee investigating the January 6th attack on the Capitol, we learned more about what happened in the days and weeks after the President sent that tweet — and the tense moments in the White House just hours before. <br/><br/>Maryland Congressman Jamie Raskin, a member of the House committee investigating January 6th, tells NPR that next week's primetime hearing — the final scheduled hearing of the committee — will unravel minute-by-minute events at the Capitol and present an account of what President Trump was doing during that time. <br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>. ]]></description>

      <title>As New Variant Surges, Officials Warn More Will Follow Without Global Vax Effort </title>
      <description><![CDATA[A new omicron subvariant is now the most dominant strain of COVID-19 in the U.S. It's called BA.5 — and it appears to evade neutralizing antibodies, making it easier for fully-vaccinated people to become infected or those who recently had COVID to get re-infected. <br/><br/>Dr. Ayoade Alakija, co-chair of the African Union's Africa Vaccine Delivery Alliance, warns that more variants will follow unless global vaccine efforts get more aggressive. <br/><br/>Atul Gawande, head of global health for the U.S. Agency for International Development, says Congress needs to authorize a new round of spending to help get vaccines to countries where many people still have not been vaccinated. <br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>. ]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Donald Trump's lie that the election was stolen from him continues to spread. That's, in large part, because of a group of people crisscrossing the country, spreading false claims about voter fraud. <br/><br/>NPR's Investigations team used social media and news reports to track four key figures in the movement: MyPillow CEO and longtime Trump supporter Mike Lindell, former U.S. Army Captain Seth Keshel, former high school math and science teacher Douglas Frank, and former law professor David Clements. <br/><br/>NPR's <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/395772167/miles-parks">Miles Parks</a> explains their findings. <br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>.]]></description>

      <title>Criminal Prosecution Of Pregnancy Loss Expected To Increase Post-Roe</title>
      <description><![CDATA[In states across the country, long before the Supreme Court overturned Roe v. Wade, pregnant people were already being criminally charged, convicted, and imprisoned for loss of pregnancy. Advocates for reproductive rights say this is because laws created to protect pregnant people from violence and abuse are being used to prosecute people whose pregnancies end prematurely.  <br/><br/>We speak with Dana Sussman of National Advocates for Pregnant Women about how the prosecution of pregnancy loss could look in the country's new, post-Roe era.

      <title>Pell Grants In Prison: A New Effort To Fund Degrees For People Behind Bars</title>
      <description><![CDATA[There are 1.5 million people in state and federal prisons in the United States. Very few of them get a chance to earn a bachelor degree. That's due to a decades-old ban on the use of federal money to help people in prison pay for college classes. <br/><br/>But that's about to change. Starting with the 2023-2024 school year, people in prison will be eligible to receive Pell grants in the amount of nearly $7,000 per year. Experts say this change will mean a chance at higher education for hundreds of thousands who are academically eligible. <br/><br/>NPR's <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/378865949/elissa-nadworny">Elissa Nadworny </a>reports on what the change means, and tells the story of a man who earned the type of degree that will soon be available to many more people. <br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>. ]]></description>

      <title>Does HBO's 'The Wire' still hold up after 20 years?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Omar Little, Jimmy McNulty, Stringer Bell, Snot Boogie. If you recognize these names, you are probably a fan of the HBO series The Wire. <br/><br/>This month marks 20 years since the series premiere.  It ran for five seasons, following the lives of the cops, criminals, political players, and everyday folks caught up in Baltimore's often futile war on drugs. <br/><br/>Many argue that The Wire is the best television show ever created and has earned praise for its realistic, humanizing, multi-dimensional portrayal of Black characters. But 20 years on, the conversation about policing in Black communities has changed. The deaths of Freddie Gray, George Floyd, and many others after encounters with police and the rise of the Black Lives Matter Movement have brought about more public scrutiny, debate, and criticism of the police. <br/><br/>As social commentary, is The Wire still relevant? We speak with NPR TV critic Eric Deggans and Ronda Racha Penrice, editor of the essay collection, Cracking The Wire During Black Lives Matter.<br/><br/>In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community.<br/><br/>Email us at considerthis@npr.org.<br/>]]></description>

      <title>DACA Recipients On Ten Years Of Precarious Protection</title>
      <description><![CDATA[It's been ten years since the Obama administration announced Deferred Action for Childhood Arrivals, or DACA. The policy provided protection from deportation for hundreds of thousands of undocumented immigrants brought to the US as children.<br/><br/>President Obama called it a "temporary stopgap measure," at the time, but Congress hasn't passed any legislation in the intervening years to create permanent protection for the people covered by DACA.<br/><br/>Last year, a federal judge in Texas ruled the program is illegal, and the program is essentially frozen in place while the Biden administration appeals. Current DACA recipients can reapply, but the administration can't grant any new applications. NPR's <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/159989569/joel-rose">Joel Rose</a> reports that that has left roughly 80,000 DACA applications indefinitely on hold.<br/><br/>Two early DACA recipients and advocates for undocumented immigrants, Diana Pliego and Esder Chong, discuss how they view the program, on its tenth anniversary.<br/> <br/>Help NPR improve podcasts by completing a short, anonymous survey at <a href="http://npr.org/podcastsurvey">npr.org/podcastsurvey</a>. <br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>. ]]></description>

      <title>The Emerging Deal On Gun Violence: Is It Enough? </title>
      <description><![CDATA[A bipartisan group of Senates say they have reached a deal on a package of safety and gun-related measures. The deal is not yet done, but lawmakers say they are closer than they've been in a long time. <br/><br/>The package includes measures to enhance background checks for gun buyers under 21, incentivize states to pass so-called "red flag laws," and fund school safety and mental health initiatives. Is it enough? We put that question to Gabby Giffords, a former congresswoman who was injured in a 2011 shooting. Since then, Giffords has dedicated her life to calling for action on gun control, co-founding <a href="https://giffords.org/">Giffords</a>, an advocacy group that promotes gun safety.

      <title>January 6th hearings begin, with a focus on the Proud Boys </title>
      <description><![CDATA[On Thursday, the House Select Committee investigating the January 6th insurrection at the U.S. Capitol began presenting its findings in the first in a series of high profile public hearings.  The panel showed videos of aides to former President Trump testifying that his claims of a stolen election were simply not true. Some used more colorful language. <br/><br/>The committee seeks to show that the mayhem at the Capitol was not spontaneous, but rather an orchestrated subversion of American democracy.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[On Thursday, the House Select Committee investigating the January 6th insurrection at the U.S. Capitol began presenting its findings in the first in a series of high profile public hearings.  The panel showed videos of aides to former President Trump testifying that his claims of a stolen election were simply not true. Some used more colorful language. <br/><br/>The committee seeks to show that the mayhem at the Capitol was not spontaneous, but rather an orchestrated subversion of American democracy. And they say former President Trump was a key player. <br/><br/>The hearing also included video of the Proud Boys at the Capitol on the day of the attack.

      <title>As School Shootings Claim More Victims, Young Activists Want to Be Heard </title>
      <description><![CDATA[The mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, TX has parents and students worried about safety at school. Data gathered by the Washington Post estimates that more than 300,000 students have experienced shootings at school since the 1999 school shooting in Columbine, Colorado. But experts say the impact of school shootings is far more extensive, and even children who don't come into direct contact with violence can be traumatized.<br/><br/>We speak with Hannah Rubin, a 16-year-old activist with March for Our Lives, a youth-led movement pushing for gun control measures.  <br/><br/>In <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at considerthis@npr.org.   ]]></description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[The mass shooting at Robb Elementary School in Uvalde, TX has parents and students worried about safety at school. Data gathered by the Washington Post estimates that more than 300,000 students have experienced shootings at school since the 1999 school shooting in Columbine, Colorado. But experts say the impact of school shootings is far more extensive, and even children who don't come into direct contact with violence can be traumatized.<br/><br/>We speak with Hannah Rubin, a 16-year-old activist with March for Our Lives, a youth-led movement pushing for gun control measures.  <br/><br/>In <a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at considerthis@npr.org.   ]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Can We Stop Mass Shootings Before They Start?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[In the past two weeks the nation has borne witness to the tragedy of two mass shootings. In Uvalde, Texas, a gunman killed 19 students and their two teachers inside a fourth grade classroom at Robb Elementary School. At least 17 were wounded. <br/><br/>In Buffalo, New York, a man is accused of shooting and killing 10 members of the Black community who were shopping at Tops supermarket.  In a long internet screed, he wrote about how online racist ideology and white supremacist conspiracy theories fueled his violence. Witnessing the aftermath of these horrific acts leaves us wondering, once again, what can be done to identify the warning signs of those who plan to commit mass violence—before it's too late?<br/><br/>We speak with Joanna Schroeder about ways to protect young people from being indoctrinated into violent white supremacist groups. Schroeder chronicles her sons' exposure to content from online racist hate groups and how she intervened.  <br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>. ]]></description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[In the past two weeks the nation has borne witness to the tragedy of two mass shootings. In Uvalde, Texas, a gunman killed 19 students and their two teachers inside a fourth grade classroom at Robb Elementary School. At least 17 were wounded. <br/><br/>In Buffalo, New York, a man is accused of shooting and killing 10 members of the Black community who were shopping at Tops supermarket.  In a long internet screed, he wrote about how online racist ideology and white supremacist conspiracy theories fueled his violence. Witnessing the aftermath of these horrific acts leaves us wondering, once again, what can be done to identify the warning signs of those who plan to commit mass violence—before it's too late?<br/><br/>We speak with Joanna Schroeder about ways to protect young people from being indoctrinated into violent white supremacist groups. Schroeder chronicles her sons' exposure to content from online racist hate groups and how she intervened.  <br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>. ]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[This week marks two years since George Floyd's murder at the hands of a white police officer and the subsequent racial justice protests and calls for police reform that spread from Minneapolis across the country. President Joe Biden has signed a new executive order meant to change how police use force among other measures, which experts say is a small — but important — step in preventing more tragedies like Floyd's death.<br/><br/>But as Minnesota Pubic Radio's Matt Sepic reports, some Minneapolis residents say they're still waiting on the reform that leaders promised.<br/><br/>Also in this episode, Robert Samuels and Toluse Olorunnipa  of The Washington Post discuss their new biography, <em>His Name Is George Floyd</em>, and how those who knew Floyd best want to make sure his legacy covers more than his murder.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>. ]]></description>

      <title>Investigating The Tragic History Of Federal Indian Boarding Schools </title>
      <description><![CDATA[Last year the remains of 215 children were found in unmarked graves on the site of a former residential school for Indigenous children in British Columbia.

      <title>The Children's Mental Health Crisis Didn't Start With The Pandemic</title>
      <description><![CDATA[The United States is experiencing an adolescent mental health crisis. Experts from the Centers for Disease Control and Prevention to the Surgeon General are stressing the urgent need to address the mental health needs of children and teens.  <br/><br/>The pandemic focused attention on this issue as young people dealt with isolation, the uncertainty of lockdown and grief over the death of loved ones. But while the pandemic exacerbated the problem, it has been building for years. <br/><br/>We speak with Judith Warner, a journalist and author, to find out how we got to this point, and what can be done to help kids now. Warner's most recent piece, "<a href="https://www.washingtonpost.com/magazine/2022/03/21/childrens-mental-health-crisis-politicization/">We Have Essentially Turned a Blind Eye to Our Own Children for Decades</a>," appears in <em>The Washington Post</em> <em>Magazine.</em><br/><br/><em>This episode deals with suicide.

      <title>Roe's Legal Fate Is Unclear. But Studies Already Show Who'd Likely Be Hit Hardest</title>

      <title>The Road To Overturning Roe v. Wade</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Earlier this week, a leaked draft opinion from the Supreme Court suggested that after nearly 50 years, the court intends to overturn Roe v. Wade, the 1973 decision that legalized abortion nationwide. <br/><br/>Almost as soon as abortions became legal, opponents began organizing efforts to repeal the law. Eighteen states now have so-called "trigger laws"  that will ban abortions the moment that Roe v. Wade is overturned or pre-"Roe" era bans that remain on the books, ready once again, to fall into place.<br/><br/>We'll look back at the longstanding efforts by legal, political and religious groups - on both sides of the debate - that have led to this moment. And we'll discuss what comes next. <br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>. <br/><br/><em>Audio in the podcast from Supreme Court arguments of Roe v.

      <title>The Potential Impact Of The Decision To Overturn Roe v. Wade</title>
      <description><![CDATA[The right to an abortion in the United States appears closer than ever to being eliminated, after a draft of a majority opinion that would overturn <em>Roe v.

      <description><![CDATA[The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention's mask mandate on planes, trains and buses ended earlier this month, and it came down, in part, to a judge's interpretation of the word "sanitation."

      <title>How COVID-19 Conspiracy Theories Led To A Family Matriarch's Preventable Death</title>

Her family says Stephanie's death was avoidable, but in recent years, she had been drawn into conspiracy theories.<br/><br/>She believed that the coronavirus was a hoax and refused to get vaccinated. When she got COVID-19 last winter, Stephanie refused treatments and eventually died just a few days after Christmas. <br/><br/>While there is no way to know exactly how many people like Stephanie have died because they believed conspiracy theories, the Kaiser Family Foundation recently found that more than 200,000 Americans would be alive today, had they had been vaccinated. <br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/people/279612138/geoff-brumfiel">NPR's Geoff Brumfiel </a>reports. <br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>. ]]></description>

      <title>Ukrainian Teacher Plans For A Future In Romania</title>
      <description><![CDATA[More than 4.5 million Ukrainians have left their country since Russia began its invasion of Ukraine. While many hope to return to Ukraine, they don't know when it will be safe to do so. As the war shows no sign of stopping, some refugees are beginning to integrate into life in their adoptive countries. <br/><br/>One of those people is Anastasiia Konovalova. She used to be the head teacher at a primary school in Odesa, Ukraine, but fled to Bucharest, Romania after the war began. In a matter of weeks, she's managed to get a school for Ukrainian refugees up and running. With more than 600 Ukrainian children on a waitlist to attend, Konovalova is now thinking about what a future in Romania could look like for these refugee children. <br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>.]]></description>

      <title>Refugee Assistance From One Of Europe's Poorest Countries</title>
      <description><![CDATA[More than 400,000 Ukrainian refugees have poured across the border into the small country of Moldova, one of the poorest countries in Europe. Wedged between Ukraine and Romania, Moldova is a little bigger than Maryland, but it has received the most refugees per capita of any country in this crisis. Now Moldova is providing assistance and support to those who are choosing to stay in the country. <br/><br/>Even as they open their doors to Ukrainian refugees, many in the small country fear they may be next in line for invasion by Russian forces. Moldova declared independence from the Soviet Union shortly after its fall in 1991, but since then there have been Russian troops stationed in a separatist region of the country called Transnistria. Moldova fears it would not be able to fend off a Russian offensive. <br/><br/>NPR's Frank Langfitt explains why Moldova is in such a perilous position, and we talk to aid workers about how they are supporting Ukranians fleeing war.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>.]]></description>

      <title>Another Booster? Omicron Shot? What's Next For COVID Vaccines </title>
      <description><![CDATA[Many Americans haven't gotten an initial COVID-19 booster. A second one is authorized for some. Others are waiting to see if they can get one soon. Will everyone need them eventually? An FDA advisory committee met Wednesday to discuss what's next in America's booster strategy. <br/><br/>Dr. Anthony Fauci tells NPR the path forward is paved with uncertainties — about whether more variants will arise, how long booster protection lasts, and what kind of funding will be available for research. Fauci spoke to NPR's <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/146944972/rob-stein">Rob Stein</a>, who explains what's likely for booster guidance later this fall. <br/><br/>Whatever the future of the pandemic holds, public health officials are hoping to get early glimpses of it by monitoring waste water treatment plants. <a href="https://www.cpr.org/author/john-daley/">John Daley</a> reports. <br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>. ]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Binge watching a show you love is enjoyable, but not always productive.

They didn't intend to write a full album, but as they workshopped the songs on social media, fans everywhere watched as Barlow & Bear wrote the songs live — offering followers a front row seat to the music making process. <br/><br/>This weekend at the 64th annual Grammy Awards, Emily Bear and Abigail Barlow will be in the audience waiting to hear if their album, <em>The Unofficial Bridgerton Musical</em>, wins in the category of Best Musical Theater Album.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>. ]]></description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Binge watching a show you love is enjoyable, but not always productive. But artists Abigail Barlow and Emily Bear turned their binge into a Grammy nomination.<br/><br/>They were inspired by Season 1 of Netflix's series <em>Bridgerton</em>, and used that inspiration to write a full musical theater album. They didn't intend to write a full album, but as they workshopped the songs on social media, fans everywhere watched as Barlow & Bear wrote the songs live — offering followers a front row seat to the music making process. <br/><br/>This weekend at the 64th annual Grammy Awards, Emily Bear and Abigail Barlow will be in the audience waiting to hear if their album, <em>The Unofficial Bridgerton Musical</em>, wins in the category of Best Musical Theater Album.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>. ]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[Even if you're not a fan of celebrity gossip, you've probably heard that there's something going on with the rapper Ye, formerly known as Kanye West. He's exhibited increasingly erratic behavior, including relentless online harassment of his ex-wife, reality TV queen Kim Kardashian and her current boyfriend, comedian Pete Davidson. Now he's been banned from performing at the Grammys, and was recently suspended from Instagram for a day. <br/><br/>For years Ye's behavior has been puzzling to observe - ranging from announcing plans to run for President, to moving into a windowless basement room inside of a stadium to complete his last album, to high profile feuds with everyone from Jay Z to Jimmy Kimmel. He has admitted that he struggles with bipolar disorder and that instead of medical treatment he uses his art as therapy<br/><br/>.Fans, critics and those who write and talk seriously about the arts are just not sure how to talk about the situation.<br/><br/>Aisha Harris of NPR's Pop Culture Happy Hour joins us to unpack some of the complexities.

      <title>How Becoming A Refugee Changes You </title>
      <description><![CDATA[Inside Ukraine, millions of people have been displaced, with millions more living in increasingly dire conditions. In the city of Maruipol, hundreds of thousands of civilians remain trapped — with dwindling supplies of food and water and no electricity. Mariupol has been bombarded by the Russians for weeks now. Petro Andrushchenko, an adviser to Mariupol's mayor, told NPR civilians in bomb shelters are running out of food. Millions of others have fled Ukraine without knowing if or when they'll be able to return home. Amid that uncertainty, they must start a new life elsewhere. It's an experience only people who've been refugees can truly understand. Mary Louise Kelly talks with refugees from Vietnam, Syria, and Afghanistan about their experiences, how fleeing their home country has affected their life and what life is like now.

      <title>Why Do So Few Public Defenders Become Judges?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Senate confirmation hearings begin next week for Supreme Court nominee Judge Ketanji Brown Jackson. If she is confirmed she will be the first Black woman on the high court and the first public defender. Judge Jackson served as a federal public defender between 2005 and 2007. She defended several Guantanamo detainees and others accused of crimes, a fact that her critics use to suggest that she works to free terrorists and put criminals back on the street.<br/><br/>The 6th Amendment to the Constitution guarantees every criminal defendant the right to an attorney. The right to have effective counsel, along with presumption of innocence are the basic principles of fairness in our legal system. But too often, having worked as a defense attorney is a stop sign on the road to the bench.<br/><br/>We speak with Martin Sabelli, president of the board of directors of the National Association of Criminal Defense Lawyers. He explains why our legal system needs more judges with a background in criminal defense.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>. ]]></description>

      <title>A Look At Anti-Asian Violence One Year After The Atlanta Shootings</title>
      <description><![CDATA[It's been one year since a white man opened fire at three spas in the Atlanta area killing eight people — six of whom were Asian women. <br/><br/>Since the beginning of the pandemic there has been an alarming rise in hate crimes against Asian people in America, and a majority of the victims are women.<br/><br/>Harmful stereotypes of Asian Women play a huge role here — often portrayed in pop culture as demure, exotic, hyper sexualized, or carriers of disease. <br/><br/>CNN journalist Amara Walker discusses what it feels like to live with these stereotypes and the threat of violence as an Asian American woman. <br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>. ]]></description>

      <title>Can Diplomacy Prevail In Ukraine?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Ukrainian President Volodymyr Zelenskyy wants America to help impose a no-fly zone over Ukraine. The U.S. favors other avenues of support, providing weapons and equipment.

      <description><![CDATA[Russian President Vladimir Putin has signed a law that could impose fifteen years in prison on anyone who publishes or broadcasts what the Russian government considers "false information" about the invasion of Ukraine. The law makes it illegal to use the word "war" or "invasion," a move aimed at shutting down the last remaining independent Russian media outlets.<br/><br/>Even as news is being censored and social media platforms are being shut down, some people in Russia are determined to be heard. The Russian independent human rights group <a href="https://ovd.news/news/2022/03/02/russian-protests-against-war-ukraine-chronicle-events">OVD-Info</a> reports that more than 13,000 protesters in 147 cities have been detained since the war began just over two weeks ago.<br/><br/>Yulia Zhivtsova is one of those protesters. She was detained in Moscow for taking part in protests the day after Russia invaded Ukraine. She's one of the thousands of protesters across the country who are defying the threat of violence and prison to express their opposition to the war in Ukraine.<br/><br/>And we'll hear how Russian immigrants and Russian Americans are showing support for Ukraine as attitudes among some in their community shift from acceptance of Putin to outrage. <br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>. ]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[There's a battle raging over the telling and teaching of Black history in the United States. Much of that fight has been playing out in schools. School board meetings erupt into fights as critics attack the teaching of what they call critical race theory or charge that teaching about racism is too upsetting to white children or casts students either as oppressors or the oppressed.<br/><br/>At the heart of these arguments is a much larger issue - whether or not the country can face the truth about its painful legacy of systemic racism.  <br/><br/>In Montgomery, Alabama the National Memorial for Peace and Justice is dedicated to acknowledging America's history of racial terrorism factually, honestly, and completely. Civil rights attorney and memorial founder, Bryan Stevenson, believes that embracing this truth is the only path to healing.<br/><br/>We tour the memorial with Stevenson, hear some of the stories immortalized there and discuss the ongoing battle over how students should be taught about race.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>. ]]></description>

      <title>What To Do About America's Child Care Crisis</title>
      <description><![CDATA[America's child care system is in crisis. Experts say it's a failed business model. Parents can't afford it, and yet, daycare providers are some of the lowest paid workers in the country. The problem is an old one - but there's new energy in the debate over solutions. In part, because of the proposed funding for childcare outlined in President Biden's signature Build Back Better legislation, currently facing roadblocks. But also because the pandemic highlighted how broken the system is. <br/><br/>Brenda Hawkins operates a small home-based daycare in Upper Marlboro, Maryland. She's been taking care of kids for 24 years, but the pandemic brought new uncertainty and stress. She was able to keep her doors open, but works longer hours, without increased pay, to keep her kids healthy and safe. She has never considered leaving the business, but understands why child care workers are quitting in droves.<br/><br/>Elliot Haspel, author of <em>Crawling Behind: America's Childcare Crisis and How to Fix It</em>, outlines how the system broke down these past few years and the ways the US could fix it. <br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/> Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>. ]]></description>

      <title>Russia Makes Moves Against Ukraine</title>
      <description><![CDATA[On Monday, Russian President Vladimir Putin signed a decree recognizing two breakaway republics in Eastern Ukraine and sent troops to the region. On Tuesday, President Biden called the move "the beginning of a Russian invasion" and announced a new set of sanctions. <br/><br/>While Russia's actions reverberate throughout the world, no area has more at stake than Eastern Ukraine. That's where NPR correspondent Eleanor Beardsley has been reporting. <br/><br/>And despite the escalation this week, U.S. diplomats are hoping to keep Russia at the bargaining table.

      <title>When Your Team Loses, Disappointment Can Lead To Genuine Grief </title>
      <description><![CDATA[Fans of the Cincinnati Bengals may be licking their wounds after Sunday's Super Bowl loss, but every sports fan can relate to the pain that follows a big game not going their way. And while it's normal to be upset, those feelings of disappointment can occasionally turn into grief and even depression. <br/><br/><a href="https://drexel.edu/now/experts/Overview/zillmer-eric/">Dr. Eric Zillmer</a>, a professor of Neuropsychology at Drexel University, explains how the pandemic and brief pause on professional sports helped him understand just how strongly we rely on those games. <br/><br/>And Greg Miller, a licensed therapist, discusses ways to deal with grief from your team's loss in a healthy way. A lesson he's learned first hand. <br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>.<br/>]]></description>

      <title>What's Next For ISIS After The Death Of Their Leader</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Last Thursday morning, before dawn, U.S. special troops arrived at a house in Syria to capture the ISIS leader Abu Ibrahim al-Hashimi al-Qurayshi alive. Two hours later, he was dead after detonating an explosive that also killed the lives of at least 13 others. <br/><br/>The U.S. opted for a ground attack in an effort to protect civilians but the mission didn't go as planned. Pentagon Press Secretary John Kirby explains some of the complications. <br/><br/>And Charles Lister, a senior fellow at the Middle East Institute, explains what might happen now that the leader of ISIS is dead. <br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment to help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>. ]]></description>

      <title>Treating Gun Violence As A 'Serious Public Health Threat'</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Firearm-related injuries are among the 5 leading causes of death for people ages 1-64 in the United States, <a href="https://www.cdc.gov/violenceprevention/firearms/fastfact.html">according to the CDC</a>. In 2019, there were 39,707 firearm-related deaths in the United States. That's an average of 109 deaths per day. Firearm-related injuries are harder to quantify, but the <a href="https://www.gunviolencearchive.org/past-tolls">Gun Violence Archive</a> reports that there were over 40,000 last year. <br/><br/>CDC Director Dr. Rochelle Walensky has called gun violence a "<a href="https://www.cnn.com/2021/08/27/health/cdc-gun-research-walensky/index.html">serious public health threat</a>."

      <title>The Cost of COVID Safety Precautions Can Be A Big Burden For Some Families</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Masks and at-home COVID-19 test kits have become staples of pandemic life. The Biden Administration announced in January that it would distribute 400 million free N95 respirators to pharmacies and grocery stores around the country. The U.S. Postal Service has begun taking orders for free at-home test kits. Supply remains limited, so many are still purchasing masks and tests on their own, and the costs can easily add up.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.brookings.edu/experts/wendy-edelberg/">Wendy Edelberg</a> is a Senior Fellow of Economic Studies at the Brookings Institution who studies household spending and saving habits.

The Biden Administration announced in January that it would distribute 400 million free N95 respirators to pharmacies and grocery stores around the country.

But close to that border, in the Donbas region, people look at you a little funny if you ask whether they're worried about war with Russia, because they are already living through it. <br/><br/>Areas of Eastern Ukraine have been at war since 2014 when Russia-backed separatists moved in and declared breakaway republics. And that's where NPR's Mary Louise Kelly has been, talking with residents about what this new threat might mean for them.  <br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment that will help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>. ]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[The Centers for Disease Control and Prevention announced this week that people who test positive for COVID-19 but remain asymptotic can cut their quarantine time in half, from ten days to five. This shift comes in part due to major disruptions causes by rising Omicron cases, with hospitals and airlines in particular struggling to stay fully staffed. <br/><br/>This moment in the pandemic feels a little like living in a contradiction. Cases are rising, yet guidance on certain restrictions is loosening. Hospitals are filling up, yet many infections are mild. <br/><br/>Prof. Gaurav Suri, computational neuroscientist at San Francisco State, and Dr. Leana Wen, emergency physician and public health professor at George Washington University, discuss how to live with the threat of Omicron right now. <br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment that will help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>. <br/>]]></description>

      <title>Manchin's Holiday Gift To Fellow Dems: A Lump Of Coal On Climate Change</title>
      <description><![CDATA[This week, Democratic West Virginia Senator Joe Manchin said he cannot support the Build Back Better Act, which contains more than half a trillion dollars in climate investments. The White House has been negotiating with Manchin for months, hoping he would cast a key vote for the plan in the Senate, where their party's majority is razor thin. <br/><br/>Without Manchin's support, the Biden administration's most ambitious action on climate may be dead, and the U.S. could fall short of key goals to prevent the worst effects of climate change. <br/><br/>Reporters from NPR's climate change team — <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/4127076/jeff-brady">Jeff Brady</a>, <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/803934365/lauren-sommer">Lauren Sommer</a>, and <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/143160021/daniel-charles">Dan Charles</a> — take stock of where things go from here. <br/><br/>NPR's <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/2100815/jennifer-ludden">Jennifer Ludden</a> also contributed to this episode.

The White House has been negotiating with Manchin for months, hoping he would cast a key vote for the plan in the Senate, where their party's majority is razor thin. <br/><br/>Without Manchin's support, the Biden administration's most ambitious action on climate may be dead, and the U.S. could fall short of key goals to prevent the worst effects of climate change. <br/><br/>Reporters from NPR's climate change team — <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/4127076/jeff-brady">Jeff Brady</a>, <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/803934365/lauren-sommer">Lauren Sommer</a>, and <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/143160021/daniel-charles">Dan Charles</a> — take stock of where things go from here. <br/><br/>NPR's <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/2100815/jennifer-ludden">Jennifer Ludden</a> also contributed to this episode.

And everyone had stories of how climate change is already affecting their lives. But, did the conference accomplish what it set out to do? <br/><br/>Alok Sharma, president of COP26, gives us a behind-the-scenes glimpse into what the conference felt like from the inside, why he apologized for the process, and what it was like trying to get delegates from nearly 200 countries on the same page. <br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment that will help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>. ]]></content:encoded>

Although it's too early to tell how this virus strain will spread, the threat it poses has already lit a fire under public health messaging. <br/><br/>President Biden announced a new strategy to avoid a winter surge of cases that involves free at-home testing, a vaccine booster messaging campaign and heightened international travel safeguards. <br/><br/>Meanwhile, the race is on to detect how omicron is already spreading in this country.

      <title>A Supreme Court Case That Could Upend Roe v. Wade</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Getting an abortion in Mississippi has never been easy, but it hasn't been impossible. Now, a case before the Supreme Court that centers on a clinic in Mississippi could upend abortion rights for pregnant people across the country.  <br/><br/>Today, the conservative-leaning court heard arguments in the case of <em>Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization</em>. The clinic, which is the only abortion provider remaining in Mississippi, is challenging a 2018 state law that bans termination after 15 weeks of pregnancy. If the court upholds the law, it would reverse its own precedent by allowing states to interfere with the right to abortion at that stage of pregnancy. <br/><br/>NPR Chief Legal Affairs Correspondent Nina Totenberg, SCOTUS Blog's Tom Goldstein, and Florida State University Law Professor Mary Ziegler parse the arguments and weigh in on the possibilities on how the justices could rule.<br/><br/>In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment that will help you make sense of what's going on in your community.<br/><br/>Email us at considerthis@npr.org.]]></description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Getting an abortion in Mississippi has never been easy, but it hasn't been impossible. Now, a case before the Supreme Court that centers on a clinic in Mississippi could upend abortion rights for pregnant people across the country.  <br/><br/>Today, the conservative-leaning court heard arguments in the case of <em>Dobbs v. Jackson Women's Health Organization</em>. The clinic, which is the only abortion provider remaining in Mississippi, is challenging a 2018 state law that bans termination after 15 weeks of pregnancy. If the court upholds the law, it would reverse its own precedent by allowing states to interfere with the right to abortion at that stage of pregnancy. <br/><br/>NPR Chief Legal Affairs Correspondent Nina Totenberg, SCOTUS Blog's Tom Goldstein, and Florida State University Law Professor Mary Ziegler parse the arguments and weigh in on the possibilities on how the justices could rule.<br/><br/>In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment that will help you make sense of what's going on in your community.<br/><br/>Email us at considerthis@npr.org.]]></content:encoded>

      <description><![CDATA[The World Health Organization is warning that the omicron variant of the coronavirus, which was first detected in South Africa, has a "very high" global risk because of the possibility that it spreads more easily and might resist vaccines and immunity in people who were infected with previous strains. <br/><br/>On Monday, President Joe Biden said this this variant is a "cause for concern, not a cause for panic." He urged Americans to get fully vaccinated and get a booster dose if they qualify. <br/><br/>WHO spokesperson Dr. Margaret Harris explains what more there is to learn about the severity and transmission of this new variant. <br/><br/>And Dr. Francis Collins, director of the National Institutes of Health (NIH) discusses why vaccine hesitation on a global scale could make this next phase of the pandemic more dangerous. <br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment that will help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>.]]></description>

      <title>NPR Investigates: CTE, Desperate Patients, And The Hope For A Cure (Pt 2)</title>
      <description><![CDATA[CTE —  chronic traumatic encephalopathy — is a degenerative brain disease found in many former professional football and hockey players, for whom blows to the head have long been part of the job. <br/><br/>But those injuries also occur outside the world of pro sports. And as awareness of CTE has grown, so has a thriving market of dubious remedies marketed to everyday people who believe they are suffering from CTE — a disease that can't even be diagnosed until after death, through an autopsy of the brain. <br/><br/>In the second of two episodes, <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/676406186/sacha-pfeiffer">Sacha Pfeiffer</a> of NPR's Investigative Team reports on some of those desperate patients and their hope for a cure. <br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment that will help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>. ]]></description>

      <title>Living with Long COVID </title>
      <description><![CDATA[For those living with long COVID, daily activities like going for a walk, washing the dishes, or being on a Zoom call can be incredibly draining. <br/><br/>These long-term effects of a COVID infection - called post-acute sequelae of SARS-CoV-2, PASC, or more simply long COVID - have been a reality for many patients since the start of the pandemic. <br/><br/>While it is not known exactly how common long COVID is, it isn't rare. One study found that some 30% of participants across multiple age ranges reported persistent symptoms.  For some, symptoms fade after a few months, while for others, long COVID feels like their new reality. <br/><br/>NPR's Mallory Yu has been reporting on long COVID and gathered the stories of patients who are desperate for answers.  <br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment that will help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>. ]]></description>

      <title>How A Dictator Engineered A Migration Crisis At The Belarus-Poland Border</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Migrants from faraway countries are stuck in Belarus, just across its border with Poland. They've traveled there to seek asylum in the EU. But Poland has refused to accept them. <br/><br/>How did they get there? They were invited — and in some cases, their travel facilitated — by the regime of Belarusian dictator Alexander Lukashenko. EU leaders say Lukashenko and his backers in Russia are 'weaponizing' migration in retaliation for sanctions placed on Belarus last year. Those sanctions came after the EU accused Lukashenko of rigging his most recent election. <br/><br/>Now, many hundreds of migrants are stuck on the Belarus side of the border. There have been at least nine recorded deaths, but observers think there have been many more. Migrants were reportedly moved from makeshift camps outdoors to a government-run shelter on Thursday, though it's unclear what Belarus plans to do with them next. <br/><br/>NPR international correspondent Rob Schmitz has seen the crisis up close.

      <title>Yeah, The Supply Chain Situation Isn't Looking Great For The Holidays</title>

      <title>As Climate Summit Moves Ahead, The World's Biggest Polluters Are Behind</title>
      <description><![CDATA[A U.N. climate summit is underway this week in Glasgow, Scotland. Many of the world's top carbon emitting-countries will be represented there. Scientists say they need to do more to curb greenhouse gas emissions in order to avoid the most catastrophic effects of climate change. <br/><br/>The U.S, along with the China, are the world's top greenhouse gas emitters. India is third. And Brazil plays a crucial role in global climate, because it is home to vast rainforests that feed on carbon. But those rainforests are disappearing faster until the current government. <br/><br/>Ahead of the summit, NPR international correspondents in China, India, and Brazil gathered to discuss what climate action those countries are taking:  <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/705255512/emily-feng">Emily Feng</a> in Beijing, <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/463861805/lauren-frayer">Lauren Frayer</a> in Mumbai, and <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/2101062/philip-reeves">Philip Reeves</a> in Rio de Janeiro.<br/><br/>NPR's <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/803934365/lauren-sommer">Lauren Sommer</a> outlined the stakes at the Glasgow summit <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/10/29/1045344199/cop26-glasgow-climate-summit">here</a>. <br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment that will help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>.  ]]></description>

      <title>Author Grady Hendrix Explores What Happens To 'Final Girls' After The Credits Roll</title>
      <description><![CDATA[A final girl in the horror genre is the woman who is left to deal with the aftermath of surviving a terrifying killer. From <em>The Texas Chainsaw Massacre</em>, to <em>Friday the 13th</em>, to <em>Halloween</em>.<br/><br/>The term 'Final Girl' was first coined by writer Carol J. Clover in her book <em>Men, Women, and Chainsaws: Gender in the Modern Horror Film</em>. <br/><br/>Society knows this trope well. But after the credits roll, audiences typically don't know much about what actually happens to that final girl. Or whether she can live a normal life after being hunted down by a masker killer. <br/><br/>Author Grady Hendrix unpacks that in his latest novel,<a href="https://www.gradyhendrix.com/the-final-girl-support-group/"> <em>The Final Girl Support Group</em>.</a><br/><br/>"The ultimate faceless killer they can't escape is the forces of market capitalism. There's always a sequel. So even if you survive Part I and II, they're going to get you in Part III. And there's something terrible about that to me, that you never get to let your guard down," Hendrix said.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment that will help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>. ]]></description>

      <title>Why Iraq's Protest Movement Led To An Election That Millions Sat Out</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Two years ago, a massive protest movement swept through Iraq. People were angry about corruption and a lack of basic services like electricity and health care in a country that brings in billions of dollars in oil revenue each year. That protest movement culminated in a parliamentary election, held earlier this month. <br/><br/>NPR international correspondent <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/576542412/ruth-sherlock">Ruth Sherlock</a> reported on the election closely from inside Iraq. Through her reporting, and in conversation with host <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/2101154/ari-shapiro">Ari Shapiro</a>, Ruth explains why Iraq's election failed to deliver on hopes for reform — and what it revealed about America's long and costly investment in the country's democracy. <br/><br/>This episode contains excerpts from multiple stories Ruth Sherlock reported over the course of weeks inside Iraq. <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/576542412/ruth-sherlock">You can find more of her work here</a>. <br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment that will help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>.  ]]></description>

      <title>Why The Global Supply Chain Is Still Clogged — And How To Fix It</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Last week the White House announced a plan to help move the port of Los Angeles into 24/7 operating status.

      <title>Colin Powell's Complicated Legacy</title>

He was the first African American to hold each of these roles. <br/><br/>But Powell's story will always be entwined with the Iraq War.

      <title>Why A Growing Number Of Haitian Migrants Are Headed To The U.S.</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Thousands of Haitian migrants who had gathered on the southern border were deported back to their home country last week, even though some of them haven't lived there for a decade. They'd been living in Chile. But increasingly, Haitians in that country are fleeing, in response to a pandemic-battered economy, rising anti-immigrant sentiment, and new government policies. <br/><br/>All those factors are not disappearing any time soon — and neither is the flow of migrants out of the country, says Chilean journalist Ignacio Gallegos.

      <title>Delta Surge Slows Recovery As Parts Of Pandemic Safety Net Disappear</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Last week's jobs report for the month of August show signs the delta surge is slowing the economic recovery, just as some pandemic safety net programs disappear.

      <title>As A Destructive Fire Season Rages On, What Might Prevent The Next One? </title>
      <description><![CDATA[The good news is that firefighters in California have regained control of the Caldor Fire near Lake Tahoe and tens of thousands of evacuated residents can now return to their homes. The bad news is the Caldor Fire is the second wildfire this season to burn through the Sierra Nevada Mountains from one side to the other. Something that never happened before this year. <br/><br/>The other fire to do it is the Dixie Fire further north, which is on pace to be the largest California wildfire on record. And while thousands have been impacted with evacuations, millions of people in western states have been living with the smoke for weeks. <br/><br/>The general guidance when living with hazy and polluted air is to stay indoors. But <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/348779465/nathan-rott">NPR's Nathan Rott</a> reports on new research that shows the air behind closed doors may not be much better. <br/><br/>And <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/803934365/lauren-sommer">NPR's Lauren Sommer</a> reports on a region of the country that is leading the way with fire prevention that may surprise you. <br/><br/><br/>]]></description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[The good news is that firefighters in California have regained control of the Caldor Fire near Lake Tahoe and tens of thousands of evacuated residents can now return to their homes. The bad news is the Caldor Fire is the second wildfire this season to burn through the Sierra Nevada Mountains from one side to the other. Something that never happened before this year. <br/><br/>The other fire to do it is the Dixie Fire further north, which is on pace to be the largest California wildfire on record. And while thousands have been impacted with evacuations, millions of people in western states have been living with the smoke for weeks. <br/><br/>The general guidance when living with hazy and polluted air is to stay indoors. But <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/348779465/nathan-rott">NPR's Nathan Rott</a> reports on new research that shows the air behind closed doors may not be much better. <br/><br/>And <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/803934365/lauren-sommer">NPR's Lauren Sommer</a> reports on a region of the country that is leading the way with fire prevention that may surprise you. <br/><br/><br/>]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Chaos And Collapse In Afghanistan: How Did The U.S. Not See It Coming? </title>
      <description><![CDATA[The Taliban now control Afghanistan. How did the country's government fall so quickly — and why didn't the U.S. see it coming? NPR put those questions to the former commander of U.S. and allied forces in Afghanistan, General David Petraeus.  <br/><br/>Afghanistan's future remains unclear, especially for its women and girls. One of them is Freshta Karim, a Kabul resident and founder of a mobile library project called <a href="https://charmaghz.org/">Charmaghz</a>, who spoke to <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/4986687/audie-cornish">Audie Cornish</a>. Karim is one of many Afghans who NPR reached in Kabul during the final hours before its collapse into Taliban control. Those interviews aired on <em>Morning Edition</em>, and on special coverage produced by the staffs of <em>Weekend Edition</em> and <em>All Things Considered</em>. <br/><br/>For more Afghanistan coverage listen to <em>Up First</em> via <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/id1222114325?mt=2&at=11l79Y&ct=nprdirectory">Apple</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/2mTUnDkuKUkhiueKcVWoP0">Spotify</a>, or <a href="https://www.google.com/podcasts?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnByLm9yZy9yc3MvcG9kY2FzdC5waHA_aWQ9NTEwMzE4">Google</a>; or the <em>NPR Politics Podcast</em> via <a href="https://podcasts.apple.com/podcast/id1057255460?mt=2&at=11l79Y&ct=nprdirectory">Apple</a>, <a href="https://open.spotify.com/show/2PnWnDNwU3wKesCHCpy252">Spotify</a>, or <a href="https://www.google.com/podcasts?feed=aHR0cHM6Ly93d3cubnByLm9yZy9yc3MvcG9kY2FzdC5waHA_aWQ9NTEwMzEw">Google</a>. <br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment that will help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>. ]]></description>

      <title>Uncharted Territory: Back To School Meets The Delta Surge</title>
      <description><![CDATA[In the next few weeks, millions of children will head back to school. Many of them are too young to be vaccinated.

      <title>Ethiopia's Civil War Is Becoming A Humanitarian Crisis </title>
      <description><![CDATA[The Tigray region in northern Ethiopia is at the center of a civil war that broke out last November, after rebels there attacked a military base. Since then, the political fight has become an ethnic one, with troops no longer distinguishing civilians from rebel fighters. <br/><br/>NPR's Eyder Peralta visited the war-torn region in May and spoke with the people at the center of the conflict. <br/><br/>The United Nations says more than 400,000 people are now living in famine conditions in Ethiopia, putting them at risk of starvation if the country's civil war doesn't let up. <br/><br/>The United States is the country's largest foreign aid donor. And the person who controls that funding currently is Samantha Power, administrator for the U.S. Agency for International Development (USAID). She spoke with Ari Shapiro about she learned from her recent trip the area. <br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment that will help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>. ]]></description>

      <title>Eviction Protection Extended, But Millions Of Renters Still Face Uncertainty</title>
      <description><![CDATA[At the stroke of midnight last Saturday, a federal moratorium that had been in place for nearly eleven months expired. <br/><br/>After the Supreme Court ruled that the CDC could not extend that moratorium, the Biden administration asked Congress to take action. But Congress failed to maintain protections for renters before the House went into August recess. <br/><br/>Now, many renters fear eviction could coming knocking at their doors.<br/><br/>Rep. Cori Bush, D-Mo., told NPR that she is urging local governments to institute any protections possible to prevent a wave of mass evictions across the country. <br/><br/>The Virginia Poverty Law Center's Christine Marra explains where the national situation leaves renters in her state and across the country. <br/><br/>In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment that will help you make sense of what's going on in your community.

      <title>Black Olympians Often Have 'The Weight Of The World' On Their Shoulders </title>
      <description><![CDATA[When Simone Biles dropped out of her Olympic competitions this week, the whole world took notice. At 24 years old Biles is the most decorated gymnast ever, she's won 36 medals—27 of those are gold. And she said via Instagram that it can feel like she "has the weight of the world," on her shoulders at times. <br/><br/>When an athlete performs on a stage as hallowed and renowned as the Olympics, it's not surprising to see that this can have a negative psychological effect. University of Denver professor Mark Aoyagi explains that in many ways, elite competitions are inherently unhealthy.  <br/><br/>The stress can be even more acute for Black athletes like Biles. Sociologist Harry Edwards wrote about this over 50 years ago and says these young Olympians are forced to deal with both the aspiration and fear of "Black excellence." <br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment that will help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a> <br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>. <br/><br/>]]></description>

      <title>The New Child Tax Credit Is Here. Will Millions Get Cash Permanently?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Tens of millions of American families are beginning to receive direct cash payments as part of the expanded child tax credit, which was part of the COVID relief bill passed back in March. <br/><br/>Those payments top out at $3,600 a year per child — an amount experts say could lift tens of millions of children out of poverty. But the expanded credit is only scheduled to last one year.

      <title>How Critical Race Theory Went From Harvard Law To Fox News</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Critical race theory is a legal framework developed decades ago at Harvard Law School. It posits that racism is not just the product of individual bias, but is embedded in legal systems and policies. Today, it's become the subject of heated debate on Fox News and in local school board meetings across the country. <br/><br/><a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/author/adam-harris/">Adam Harris</a>, staff writer at <em>The Atlantic, </em>explains why. Harris <a href="https://www.theatlantic.com/politics/archive/2021/05/gops-critical-race-theory-fixation-explained/618828/">has traced the debate over critical race theory back decades</a>. <br/><br/><a href="https://naeducation.org/our-members/gloria-ladson-billings/">Gloria Ladson-Billings</a> spoke to NPR about watching that debate morph in recent years. She's president of the National Academy of Education and one of the first academics to bring critical race theory to education research.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment that will help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>.]]></description>

      <title>Questlove Unearths The Long-Forgotten 'Summer Of Soul'</title>
      <description><![CDATA[In 1969, during the same summer as Woodstock, another music festival took place 100 miles away. The Harlem Cultural Festival featured black musicians like Gladys Knight and Stevie Wonder — stars who we might not have glimpsed at this point in their careers. <br/><br/>Footage of the festival had been locked in a basement for 50 years, because TV and film companies were not interested in it at the time. <br/><br/>Questlove and his fellow filmmakers speak to Audie Cornish about bringing the concert festival to the big screen in their movie, <em>Summer Of Soul</em>, which is also out on Hulu. <br/><br/>NPR's <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/243254424/eric-deggans">Eric Deggans</a> also reviewed the film.

      <title>A 'Pandemic Of Unvaccinated People' As Delta Variant Spreads Rapidly</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Los Angeles County — America's most populous county — recently recommended mask wearing even for vaccinated people, just two weeks after the state relaxed most COVID restrictions. County officials say masks will help protect unvaccinated people from the more transmissible delta variant, which is spreading rapidly across the country. <br/><br/>CDC director Rochelle Walensky tells NPR the federal government may "encourage" states to return to more mitigation measures in places where vaccination is low and the delta variant is driving cases up. <br/><br/>That describes the situation in Missouri. <a href="https://www.kbia.org/people/rebecca-smith">Rebecca Smith</a> with member station <a href="https://kbia.missouri.edu/alleg/WebModule/Donate.aspx?P=SUSTAIN&PAGETYPE=PLG&CHECK=7xZmO7zqt1uB30noQ8KlKezWDeZ%2beA1M">KBIA </a>reports from Columbia. <br/><br/><a href="https://www.wwno.org/people/shalina-chatlani">Shalina Chatlani</a> of the Gulf States Newsroom looks at the challenge of getting more people vaccinated in southern states.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment that will help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>.]]></description>

      <title>What The Pentagon's UFO Report Reveals About Aliens — And Ourselves </title>
      <description><![CDATA[Late last year the Senate passed a bill that required U.S. intelligence agencies to share what they know about "unidentified aerial phenomena," the technical term for UFOs. That report was released last week. Spoiler alert — it doesn't confirm the existence of alien spacecraft. But it doesn't rule them out either.<br/><br/>Retired U.S. Navy Lieutenant Commander Alex Dietrich recounts her first-hand encounter with a UFO off the coast of Southern California. It's one of 144 sightings mentioned in <a href="https://www.dni.gov/files/ODNI/documents/assessments/Prelimary-Assessment-UAP-20210625.pdf">the new unclassified report. </a><br/><br/>Historian and University of Pennsylvania professor Kate Dorsch explains some of the possible reasons why Americans report more UFO sightings than any other county in the world. ]]></description>

      <title>BONUS: Tom Hanks, Fox News, And A Debate About Whiteness In Hollywood </title>
      <description><![CDATA[This all started with a guest essay by Tom Hanks for <em>The New York Times</em> called <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/04/opinion/tom-hanks-tulsa-race-massacre-history.html">"You Should Learn the Truth About the Tulsa Race Massacre,"</a> in which Hanks made the case for a more widespread teaching of American history involving Black Americans, especially of events like the Tulsa Race Massacre. He wrote: "History was mostly written by white people about white people like me, while the history of Black people — including the horrors of Tulsa — was too often left out. Until relatively recently, the entertainment industry, which helps shape what is history and what is forgotten, did the same. That includes projects of mine."<br/><br/>NPR TV and film critic Eric Deggans appreciated those words, but <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/13/1005725990/tom-hanks-is-a-non-racist-its-time-for-him-to-be-anti-racist">wrote in a column of his own that Hanks could do more from his powerful perch in Hollywood</a>. <br/><br/>Eric speaks to host <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/4986687/audie-cornish">Audie Cornish</a> about the reaction to his column, and how Hollywood reckons with its own power. (And no, he is not trying to cancel Tom Hanks.) <br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment that will help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>. ]]></description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[This all started with a guest essay by Tom Hanks for <em>The New York Times</em> called <a href="https://www.nytimes.com/2021/06/04/opinion/tom-hanks-tulsa-race-massacre-history.html">"You Should Learn the Truth About the Tulsa Race Massacre,"</a> in which Hanks made the case for a more widespread teaching of American history involving Black Americans, especially of events like the Tulsa Race Massacre. He wrote: "History was mostly written by white people about white people like me, while the history of Black people — including the horrors of Tulsa — was too often left out. Until relatively recently, the entertainment industry, which helps shape what is history and what is forgotten, did the same. That includes projects of mine."<br/><br/>NPR TV and film critic Eric Deggans appreciated those words, but <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/06/13/1005725990/tom-hanks-is-a-non-racist-its-time-for-him-to-be-anti-racist">wrote in a column of his own that Hanks could do more from his powerful perch in Hollywood</a>. <br/><br/>Eric speaks to host <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/4986687/audie-cornish">Audie Cornish</a> about the reaction to his column, and how Hollywood reckons with its own power. (And no, he is not trying to cancel Tom Hanks.) <br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment that will help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>. ]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Will The U.S. Meet Its July 4 Vaccination Goal? Your State May Already Have</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Last month, President Biden laid out an ambitious goal: to get 70% of adults in the U.S. at least one vaccine dose by July 4. With less than three weeks to go, that goal may too ambitious, Harvard epidemiologist <a href="https://www.hsph.harvard.edu/william-hanage/">Bill Hanage</a> tells NPR, and some states may see localized outbreaks this year. <br/><br/>Still — nearly two dozen states have already exceeded the 70% threshold. Many are clustered in the Northeast and Mid-Atlantic, while states with the lowest rates are largely in the South and Southwest. But there is one exception: New Mexico — where some counties report vaccination rates as high as 90%.

      <title>Democrats' Path To Big Legislation Runs Through West Virginia. Is It A Dead End?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Democratic proposals for immigration reform, gun control, infrastructure and voting rights are stalled in Congress. Standing in between Democrats and much of their progressive wish list is one of their own, West Virginia Sen.

      <title>How Anti-Trans Bills Evoke The Culture Wars Of The 90s</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Proponents of trans female athlete bans struggle to cite examples of trans women or girls gaining an unfair advantage in sports competitions. But amid a lot of debate about fairness, there's been less attention on science. NPR sports correspondent <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/2100552/tom-goldman">Tom Goldman</a> spoke to a pioneering trans researcher who explains why — in most sports —  trans women can compete fairly against cisgender women. <br/><br/>Behind a recent spate of anti-trans state laws, LGBTQ communities see a new chapter in a familiar story: the culture wars that broke out in America in the 1990s. A new episode of the FX documentary miniseries <a href="https://www.fxnetworks.com/shows/pride"><em>Pride </em></a>examines that era.

      <title>What's Changed — And What Hasn't — In The Year Since George Floyd Was Killed </title>
      <description><![CDATA[After his death on May 25, 2020, George Floyd became the face of a movement against police violence.<strong> </strong> But attorney Andrea Ritchie says, in some ways, the prosecution and conviction of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin created a false sense of progress in that movement. Ritchie focuses on police misconduct and is the author of the book, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/11/05/561931899/invisible-no-more-examines-police-violence-against-minority-women">Invisible No More: Police Violence Against Black Women And Women Of Color.</a><br/><br/>Bowling Green State University criminologist Phillip Stinson explains why so few police officers are prosecuted and convicted for murder. Stinson maintains the <a href="https://policecrime.bgsu.edu/">Henry A. Wallace Police Crime Database.</a><br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment that will help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>We're working on a future episode about people who got involved in activism in the past year.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[After his death on May 25, 2020, George Floyd became the face of a movement against police violence.<strong> </strong> But attorney Andrea Ritchie says, in some ways, the prosecution and conviction of former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin created a false sense of progress in that movement. Ritchie focuses on police misconduct and is the author of the book, <a href="https://www.npr.org/2017/11/05/561931899/invisible-no-more-examines-police-violence-against-minority-women">Invisible No More: Police Violence Against Black Women And Women Of Color.</a><br/><br/>Bowling Green State University criminologist Phillip Stinson explains why so few police officers are prosecuted and convicted for murder. Stinson maintains the <a href="https://policecrime.bgsu.edu/">Henry A. Wallace Police Crime Database.</a><br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment that will help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>We're working on a future episode about people who got involved in activism in the past year.

      <title>NPR Analysis Finds Growing Vaccine Divide Between Urban And Rural America</title>
      <description><![CDATA[We know that Americans in blue states are getting vaccinated at higher rates than those in red ones. But that gap obscures another growing divide in America's vaccine campaign — the divide <em>within </em>states between rural and urban areas.

NPR's <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/964574083/austin-fast">Austin Fast</a> explains why. <br/><br/>The Biden administration says it's making progress on closing the gap.

      <title>Long Before QAnon Conspiracies, The U.S. Was Swept By 'Satanic Panic' </title>
      <description><![CDATA[Over the past year, QAnon conspiracies have migrated from obscure corners of the internet into national headlines. The false belief that left-wing Satanists are controlling the government helped fuel the U.S. Capitol insurrection on Jan. 6. <br/><br/>These theories didn't come from nowhere. Back in the 1980s a similar "satanic panic" swept through the country and led to lawsuits that alleged preschool teachers were performing evil rituals with children. These claims were debunked but the accusations themselves had staying power. <br/><br/>NPR's Ari Shapiro reports on what factors contributed to the original "satanic panic" and what it can teach us about the conspiracy theories that attract followers today. <br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment that will help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>. ]]></description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[Over the past year, QAnon conspiracies have migrated from obscure corners of the internet into national headlines. The false belief that left-wing Satanists are controlling the government helped fuel the U.S. Capitol insurrection on Jan. 6. <br/><br/>These theories didn't come from nowhere. Back in the 1980s a similar "satanic panic" swept through the country and led to lawsuits that alleged preschool teachers were performing evil rituals with children. These claims were debunked but the accusations themselves had staying power. <br/><br/>NPR's Ari Shapiro reports on what factors contributed to the original "satanic panic" and what it can teach us about the conspiracy theories that attract followers today. <br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment that will help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>. ]]></content:encoded>

      <title>Will Justice For George Floyd Lead To Lasting Change?</title>
      <description><![CDATA[As crowds gathered  Tuesday evening after former Minneapolis police officer Derek Chauvin was found guilty of murder in the death of  George Floyd, two themes emerged. Many expressed joy and relief for the verdict delivered by the 12-person jury. But they also said the work isn't over, and the national debate over police violence and accountability can't end with a single criminal trial.<br/><br/>That message was also shared by the White House and Vice President Harris. On Wednesday, Attorney General Merrick Garland announced the Justice Department is opening an investigation into possible patterns of discrimination and excessive force within the Minneapolis Police Department. And lawmakers in Congress are renewing a push for a police reform act that bears George Floyd's name. <br/><br/>For the last eleven months, one of the loudest voices demanding justice for George Floyd — insisting that the country and the world not forget him — has been his brother, Philonise Floyd. Philonise and Benjamin Crump, the Floyd family attorney, share what lasting change will look like to them now that a verdict has been delivered.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear from local journalists about what's happening in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>.]]></description>

In that year, Taylor's name<strong> </strong>has become a national symbol in the fight against racial injustice and police violence.

      <title>COVID-19 Relief And Cash Payments Near; CDC Says Vaccinated Can Gather Without Masks</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Over the weekend, the Senate approved a version of President Biden's $1.9 trillion American Rescue Plan, setting up a vote in the House that could send the package to Biden's desk as early as Tuesday. <br/><br/>The package contains direct cash payments for many Americans, extended unemployment benefits, billions of dollars for vaccine distribution and a significant change to the child tax credit that could lift millions of American children out of poverty. <a href="https://www.law.georgetown.edu/faculty/indivar-dutta-gupta/">Indi Dutta-Gupta</a> of the Georgetown Center on Poverty and Inequality explains how the credit would work. <br/><br/>And there's new guidance for Americans who've been fully vaccinated.

      <title>What The COVID-19 Vaccine Rollout Looks Like Across The World</title>
      <description><![CDATA[President-Elect Biden's plan to attack COVID-19 includes a $20 billion plan for vaccine distribution in the U.S., hiring 100,000 public health workers to do vaccine outreach and contact tracing, and funding to ensure supplies of crucial vaccine components like small glass vials.  <br/><br/>But in order to truly contain and end the COVID-19 pandemic, every country needs to vaccinate its population. As of last week, at least 42 countries had started rolling out safe and effective COVID-19 vaccines, but none of them were low-income countries. The World Health Organization says that's at least in part because rich countries have bought up the majority of the vaccine supply. <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/01/13/956506201/how-rich-countries-affect-covid-19-vaccination-in-the-rest-of-the-world">In South Africa,</a> health official Anban Pillay shares his country's challenge securing doses.<br/><br/>NPR correspondents <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/493268904/rob-schmitz">Rob Schmitz</a> in Berlin, <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/2101062/philip-reeves">Phil Reeves</a> in Rio de Janeiro and <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/576543610/daniel-estrin">Daniel Estrin</a> in Jerusalem discuss how the vaccine rollout looks in Germany, Brazil and Israel. <br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment that will help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>. ]]></description>

      <title>House Votes To Impeach, All Eyes On McConnell Amid Concerns About More Violence</title>
      <description><![CDATA[House Democrats — joined by 10 Republicans — voted to impeach President Trump on Wednesday. Now the process moves to the Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says he hasn't made a final decision — and that he'll listen to the legal arguments presented in the Senate. GOP strategist Scott Jennings, who is familiar with McConnell's thinking, spoke to NPR about why that might be. <br/><br/>No matter what McConnell does, Trump will not be president by this time next week. But between now and then, there are growing concerns about more violence in <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/01/13/956413365/state-capitals-tighten-security-amid-threat-of-armed-protests-ahead-of-inaugurat">Washington, D.C., and in cities</a> around the country, as NPR's <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/2100171/greg-allen">Greg Allen</a> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/01/13/956413365/state-capitals-tighten-security-amid-threat-of-armed-protests-ahead-of-inaugurat">has reported</a>.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment that will help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>. ]]></description>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[House Democrats — joined by 10 Republicans — voted to impeach President Trump on Wednesday. Now the process moves to the Senate, where Majority Leader Mitch McConnell says he hasn't made a final decision — and that he'll listen to the legal arguments presented in the Senate. GOP strategist Scott Jennings, who is familiar with McConnell's thinking, spoke to NPR about why that might be. <br/><br/>No matter what McConnell does, Trump will not be president by this time next week. But between now and then, there are growing concerns about more violence in <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/01/13/956413365/state-capitals-tighten-security-amid-threat-of-armed-protests-ahead-of-inaugurat">Washington, D.C., and in cities</a> around the country, as NPR's <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/2100171/greg-allen">Greg Allen</a> <a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/01/13/956413365/state-capitals-tighten-security-amid-threat-of-armed-protests-ahead-of-inaugurat">has reported</a>.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment that will help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>. ]]></content:encoded>

But those sessions were halted as a mob of Pro-Trump extremists stormed the Capitol grounds and sent the entire complex into a lockdown.<br/><br/>For more on what happened in Washington, D.C., NPR's <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/467975902/susan-davis">congressional correspondent Sue Davis,</a> spoke to <em>All Things Considered </em>hosts <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/186026737/ailsa-chang">Ailsa Chang</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/2780701/mary-louise-kelly">Mary Louise Kelly.</a> <br/><br/>The bottom line: Joe Biden will be inaugurated in 14 days.

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[A joint session of Congress to formally affirm the results of the 2020 presidential election was just getting started on Wednesday when a group of Republicans from the House and the Senate went on record objecting to election results in swing states.<br/><br/>The first objection triggered a debate period with each chamber having hours to deliberate. But those sessions were halted as a mob of Pro-Trump extremists stormed the Capitol grounds and sent the entire complex into a lockdown.<br/><br/>For more on what happened in Washington, D.C., NPR's <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/467975902/susan-davis">congressional correspondent Sue Davis,</a> spoke to <em>All Things Considered </em>hosts <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/186026737/ailsa-chang">Ailsa Chang</a> and <a href="https://www.npr.org/people/2780701/mary-louise-kelly">Mary Louise Kelly.</a> <br/><br/>The bottom line: Joe Biden will be inaugurated in 14 days. And it looks like he'll take office with a Democratic-controlled Senate.<br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/2021/01/06/953885835/welcome-to-the-new-georgia-warnock-on-his-win-in-georgia-runoff">Rev.

David Perdue in the second Georgia Senate runoff, according to an AP race call.<br/><br/>It looks like what helped put the Democrats over the top was Black voter turnout. <a href="http://www.mslatoshabrown.com/about/">LaTosha Brown</a> is co-founder of <a href="https://blackvotersmatterfund.org/">Black Voters Matter,</a> a Georgia group that helped lead get-out-the-vote efforts there.

      <title>How Much Do You Really Know About Your Flood Or Wildfire Risk?</title>

      <title>An NPR Investigation Into Lethal Injection: Why It Could Amount To Torture</title>
      <description><![CDATA[Lethal injection is commonly thought of as the most painless method of execution. But now many lawyers and doctors are looking inside the bodies of executed inmates and making the case that lethal injection could amount to torture.<br/><br/>To take a closer look at this claim, NPR producer Noah Caldwell and a team at <em>All Things Considered</em> obtained more than 300 inmate autopsies through Freedom of Information Act requests.

      <title>The Michigan Kidnapping Plot And What's Fueling Right-Wing Extremism </title>
      <description><![CDATA[The FBI announced Thursday that it had <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/10/08/921655143/militia-members-plotted-to-abduct-michigan-gov-whitmer-fbi-says">thwarted a plan by far-right militia members</a> to kidnap Michigan Gov. Gretchen Whitmer, and charged six men in relation to the plot.<br/><br/>The plot began as talk on social media sites, with a group of men gathering on Facebook to share anti-government reaction to Whitmer's coronavirus restrictions and shutdowns. <br/><br/>Experts say the pandemic, protests, and the words of the president have combined to fuel a rise in right-wing extremism.

      <title>President Trump's COVID-19 Treatment Reveals Unequal Burden Of The Disease</title>
      <description><![CDATA[President Trump told the country Tuesday: "Don't be afraid of COVID. Don't let it dominate your life." This was in a video published after the president's return to the White House from Walter Reed National Military Medical Center. During his nearly 72-hour stay, Trump received care from top doctors and experimental treatments that are not readily available to the millions of Americans who have tested positive for the coronavirus.<br/><br/>Marshall Hatch, a pastor of New Mount Pilgrim Church in Chicago, lost his sister to COVID-19 and says the president's message feels like an insult for families grieving in the wake of this disease.  <br/> <br/>While the vast majority of Americans don't have access to the kind of care that the president received, it's not the only example of how the pandemic is having disproportionate effects on certain groups. California Health Secretary Dr. Mark Ghaly explains a new state rule that will tie re-opening plans to improvements in its hardest-hit communities. <br/><br/><a href="https://www.npr.org/sections/npr-extra/2020/09/09/909126490/where-you-can-hear-a-localized-consider-this">In participating regions, you'll also hear a local news segment that will help you make sense of what's going on in your community.</a><br/><br/>Email us at <a href="mailto:considerthis@npr.org">considerthis@npr.org</a>.]]></description>

      <description><![CDATA[Breonna Taylor was shot and killed by police in March. Her killing in Louisville, Ky., was part of the fuel for the nationwide protests against police brutality and systemic racism this spring and summer. <br/><br/>On Tuesday, an announcement came that the city of Louisville had reached a $12 million settlement in a civil lawsuit brought against it. <br/><br/>But Taylor's mother, Tamika Palmer, says this is only the beginning when it comes to getting full justice. There are on-going state and federal investigations, but still no criminal charges against any of the officers involved. <br/><br/>Before she became the face of a movement, Taylor was a daughter, a niece and a treasured friend.

      <title>What's Driving California's Biggest-Ever Wildfire Season </title>

      <title>After SCOTUS Decision, The Future Of Abortion Rights; Mask Mandates</title>
      <description><![CDATA[On Monday, the Supreme Court issued a major decision on access to abortion. The court struck down a Louisiana law that required doctors who perform abortions at clinics to also have admitting privileges at nearby hospitals. NPR's Sarah McCammon reported from <a href="https://www.npr.org/2019/12/29/791514162/the-louisiana-clinic-at-the-center-of-abortion-case-before-supreme-court?utm_source=rss_feed_copy&utm_medium=podcast&utm_campaign=coronavirus_daily">the clinic</a> at the center of the case last year.<br/><br/>With coronavirus cases surging in North Carolina, officials issued a statewide mandate for face coverings, and are hiring bilingual contact tracers to work with the state's Latinx community.<br/><br/>Warehouses are a big source of temporary jobs in New Jersey, especially for undocumented immigrants.

      <title>Fauci Optimistic On Vaccine; What's Different About Military Homecomings </title>

But, for the moment, the full data from that research hasn't been released. <br/><br/>Friday morning, Dr. Anthony Fauci <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/05/22/860682211/dr-anthony-fauci-on-u-s-efforts-to-develop-a-coronavirus-vaccine">told NPR</a> he's seen the data and it looks "quite promising." According to Fauci, barring any setbacks, the US is on track to have a vaccine by early next year. <br/><br/>Millions of Americans are <a href="https://www.npr.org/2020/05/20/859261880/capital-area-food-bank-sees-massive-increase-in-need-during-pandemic">turning to food banks</a> to help feed their families during the pandemic. A new federal program pays farmers who've lost restaurant and school business to  donate the excess to community organizations.

      <title>How To Stay Safe As States Reopen; The Latest on Masks </title>

      <title>Federal Stay-At-Home Guidance Ends; A Potential New Test For COVID-19 </title>
      <description><![CDATA[The federal stay-at-home guidance ends on Thursday. Some governors are planning to open up their states, but others say it's too soon. <br/><br/>A potential new kind of test for COVID-19 could be simpler and cheaper to use than existing tests.
