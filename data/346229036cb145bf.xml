		<itunes:summary><![CDATA[Join Jeremy Bolm, vocalist of Touché Amoré and founder of the record label Secret Voice, for his latest project, The First Ever Podcast. This is an honest look at the humble beginnings of all kinds of different artists - from actors and musicians to poets and photographers. Through conversation, Jeremy explores how their first experiences with their art form lead them to where they are today. In today’s world of instant gratification, it’s important to be reminded that not everything happens fast and easy. To succeed as an artist, it often takes a lot of steps and wrong turns along the path. And uncovering the nuances of those creative journeys is what this show is all about.]]></itunes:summary>
