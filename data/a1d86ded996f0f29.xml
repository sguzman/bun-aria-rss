Let's take a look at this "testosterone myth" because this isn't always the case. In fact, in some cases, the higher levels of testosterone actually cause men to be MORE NICE than usual. Don't believe it? Let's take a look at what author Robert Sapolsky has to teach us about the true and subtle effects of testosterone in his book, Behave: The Biology of Humans at our Best and Worst. I think you'll be surprised.</itunes:summary></item>

In this episode I talk about what psychologists think today about dreams. You probably know that Freud thought that dreams had a <strong>manifest content</strong> (the people and things that happened in the dream that you remember) and a <strong>latent content</strong> (the unconscious meaning of the dream). Do we still think this? Also: can you look up in a book or online to find out what your dreams meant? If you dream about a cat for example – what does this mean? In this episode I explore these questions with author and psychoanalyst <strong>Kerry Malawista</strong>. She and her colleagues discuss this topic in their book, <strong>Wearing My Tutu To Analysis</strong>. I’ll talk to her and include my own thoughts about whether or not dreams have meaning and whether you should be taking the time to analyze them.</p>]]></description>

Well, congratulations, you’re something of an <strong>efficiency expert</strong>.

But some of us are really, really obsessed with efficiency and often those people are computer programmers.

Sounds impossible but I think you’ll enjoy hearing what some coders are up to. Why are they obsessed with efficiency?

Nowadays we're seeing more women in film and TV but has their role in the production really changed all that much? That's what the <strong>Bechdel test</strong>â is all about.  It's not a test per se but rather a few questions to help you determine whether the women in that movie, TV show, play, or book are characters with agency, or are just there to fill out the background for what the male characters do. In this episode I talk with Bard professor Wendy Urban-Mead about this Bechdel test and what it says about Shakespeare's plays and a play that she's appearing in called "The Women", a play featuring 35 female characters and has no male roles. Does it pass the Bechdel test?</p>]]></description>

Many people who study psychology have a negative impression of Skinner. Well, I'm about to challenge those impressions by presenting a side of Skinner you probably haven't been exposed to.

How do therapists know if what they're doing really has resulted in improvements in their clients? Yes, we have controlled studies for many treatments which give us confidence that these techniques really do help people, but we also have a lot of "therapeutic" techniques that have not been thoroughly tested. Nonetheless, lots of amazing claims are made for their effectiveness and no doubt the people who provide these therapies really do believe that they work.</p> <p>But let's step back and look critically at what we're doing. We must be willing to look critically at what we're doing as therapists or healers of any type: are you really helping people or are you just picking and choosing the "evidence" that you think indicates success? Do you just want to believe because you work hard at what you do, or because you make a lot of money at what you do, or because some of your clients have said really positive things?</p>]]></description>

Could the five stages of grief actually be doing more harm than good?

			<description><![CDATA[<p>You may have heard that Facebook manipulated the content of user's New Feeds during January of 2012 so that some users saw more positive posts than others, which other Facebook users saw more negative posts. How did this affect these users? Did those who say negative posts become more negative and vice versa? The answer is that the research indicates that some of them - though a very, very few of them - did subsequently write posts that were similar to the ones that saw on their News Feed. How big of an effect is this? Is it unethical? Does agreeing to Facebook's Terms of Use constitute "informed consent".

			<description><![CDATA[<p>What’s the connection between life on Mars and the <strong>need to properly replicate scientific studies</strong>?

What role did your parents play? In this episode I present the most recent scientific research on the topic of how we develop our sexual preference. You'll find out whether heterosexual men have more testosterone than homosexual men, how most people know their sexual orientation when they are as young as 10 years old, how your third intersitial nucleus might be playing a role and finally, finally, could it something to do with the length of your fingers?</p>]]></description>

It can be a little complicated but I’ll use the familiar example of losing weight to nail this idea down. I’ll also talk about <strong>goal setting</strong>. What’s the psychology behind getting in shape? In this episode of The Psych Files podcast I examine two established theories of human motivation – <strong>goal setting</strong> and <strong>expectancy theory</strong>. If you’ve tried the Atkins diet, the south beach diet some other low carb diet plan or even (yikes!) a lemonade diet, then it’s time to try something different – get into your head just a little bit and see what’s going on in there. Join me for a different perspective on weight loss, exercise and fitness.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>What do you do with a background in psychology? A lot of things. How about running an online community? I found Richard Millington, founder of Feverbee, talking about how he applies psychology to his business of helping organizations build strong, active online communities. As you've probably seen in your travels about the web, there are a lot of communities (such as those on Facebook) and sometimes you join them because you're interested in the person or the product the company sells. Then what happens? A lot to times nothing because that "community" isn't really a community. It's just a Facebook page that an employee created because he/she felt they "had to" because everyone else is doing it, but there's no actual discussion going on.</p> <p>What's an online community supposed to do? It's supposed to be interesting and helpful to its members. A community is supposed to "connect like minded people" and maybe even get them excited about a product and perhaps even, in the best case scenario, communities get their members to be so excited about the cause or the product that some of them become "evangelists" - real fans who spread the word.</p> <p>But how do you make this happen?

If you're upset about how addicted teens are to their phones I'll give you a few ideas that, hopefully, will make you feel better. After all, cellphones aren't going away. Quite the opposite.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>London needs help and only a person trained in psychology can fix this. There are just too many Londoners using their subway (the "tube") and instead of standing side by side as they go up the escalator, people are doing what they always do - they stand single file on the right of the escalator so that people in a hurry can pass on the left. That's a fine social norm when there aren't that many people, but if London transport is going to be usable as the population grows they're going to have to get people to behave differently.</p>
<p>How can we break such a strong norm? It's not just London's problem. When you go up the stairs which side do you stand on? The right of course, and you expect the people coming down the stairs to stay to their right. When someone doesn't follow the norm we can get pretty annoyed.</p>
<p>So what can we do to create a wide scale change in behavior? We have to apply a little social psychology.</p>]]></description>

		<author>Michael.Britt@ThePsychFiles.com (Michael Britt)</author><itunes:author>Michael Britt</itunes:author><itunes:summary>Passengers on an airplane spring to action when a stewardess needs help - but a neighborhood in New York City does very little when a woman is attacked. What's different about these situations? How can we take what we learn from the airplane and apply it to the attack? Lecturing the neighborhood residents probably won't help. Can we do anything to the way the neighborhood is laid out to encourage interaction among residents and a greater sense of interdependency among them? That's what we explore in this episode of The Psych Files.</itunes:summary></item>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>How can we use a little psychology to get you to slow down when you're driving? You'd be surprised.  Very often road signs like "Slow" or a posted speed limit of, say 20 mph does not work.  Drivers go past these signs and nothing bad happens so after a while they're ignored.  We try to make it more personal with signs say, "Drive as if your kids live here", but often that doesn't work.  How about something trickier: what if we enlisted the help of those 3D sidewalk artists?  What could they possibly do?  You'll find out.  </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>If you have not seen the movie Analyze This with Robert DeNiro and Billy Krystal, then you really should. It's not just a funny movie, bit also gets a lot of things about therapy right. So many movies portray psychotherapy so unrealistically but this movie, while it takes a lot of liberties with the therapeutic process, gets some things right and gives you a pretty good idea of how therapy progresses. Through sound bytes from the movie we'll see examples of catharsis, freudian defense mechanisms of denial and minimizing, the analysis of dreams, the breaking of therapeutic boundaries, and Rogerian techniques of reflection. A fascinating movie to take apart and that's just what I do in this episode of The Psych Files.</p>

A different race?  We're getting darn close to being able to do that with new techniques like the Rubber Hand Illusion, the Enfacement illusion, and now the Full body illusion.  You can now virtually switch bodies with someone else and thanks to our mirror neurons and other brain systems, you can have a very different sense of body ownership.  Come listen to me talk about the latest research on this topic and some potential intriguing applications to problems like bullying.</p>]]></description>

So which is it? How can you drink coffee AND take a nap? Well, apparently you can get the benefit of both - if you do it right. In this episode we not only learn about the so-called "students' coffee" but we learn about the "coffee nap". If you do it just right you can get some great memory boosts.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>What was the name of that baby in John Watson's famous videos in which he attempts to demonstrate that fears can be acquired through conditioning (pairing a loud noise with a furry animal)?  A few years ago we were presented with information indicating that a boy named Douglas Merrite was the true identity of "Little Albert".  The data looked pretty convincing at that time.  However, a few pieces of that data simply did not fit together for researchers Nancy Digdon, Russell Powell and Ben Harris.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>After another lengthy search into the past, these researchers determined that another child fits the description and the facts of who "Little Albert" really was and that boy's name is William Albert Barger.  As is often true in life, the simple facts require fewer leaps in logic and these facts make the conclusion that William Albert is "Little Albert" inescapable.</p>
<p> </p>
<p>In this episode I lay out some of these facts and I think you'll be convinced as well.  One of those facts: unfortunately, William Albert Barger died in 2007 so although we weren't able to talk with him, it appears that he lead a full and rewarding life.</p>
<p> </p>
<p><blockquote>[This] dispute ... has been settled to the satisfaction of all neutral observers from journal editors to manuscript reviewers to ... textbook author who has seen our articles.   The argument is settled.....I would turn to the question of why it took the field of psychology 5+ years to get this sorted out."</blockquote></p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>How many times have you wanted to remember a joke at a party but you just can't?  Well, there IS a way to remember jokes and I have got 4 jokes to tell you along with a mnemonic that will help you remember all 4 of them.  I challenge you to listen to these 4 jokes, then listen to my mnemonic and then wait a little while and go through the mnemonic and I guarantee that you'll remember all 4 jokes.  </p>
<p> </p>
<p>Remembering anything for more than a few minutes requires not only repetition, but also something else that will make the to-be-remembered thing stick in your head. That thing can be a mnemonic device.  In this episode I'll use a combination of the keyword technique, crazy images and a modified approach to the method of loci.  I'll use your body to help you remember these jokes.  Let's have some fun.</p>]]></description>

<p> </p>
<p>We also find out how we react to those sudden thoughts that jump into our minds - what do they mean?  Are thoughts that jump into our mind more significant than thoughts that we actively think about? </p>]]></description>

<p>We're all getting really good at using technology to avoid advertisements, but as we all know, "there's no such thing as a free lunch" - companies have to get you to find out about their products and hopefully buy them.  But when do we step over the line?  Is a little deception okay?</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>We have some great articles covered in this episode so I hope you find them thought-provoking. We cover four topics, all of which can be relevant to your everyday life.  First, a throwback to a previous episode on how to spend your money; experiences only beat out material possessions if they are spent with others. Social settings beat solitary settings every time.<br /><br />Next, did you know a social networking site you frequent may be your approach to impression management? Yes, I am talking about Facebook. Untagging, deleting, and liking certain pages, the site gives you the ability to boost your first impression and prospective employers are treating your wall like a newer, more honest resume.<br /><br />As a college student there are two things I love: procrastinating and sleeping. Our third article revolves around memory and its relation to sleep. No more all nighters cramming for exams; slow wave sleep is the key to memory recall and academic success, but only in young adults.<br /><br />Lastly, we found how smiling can lower dominance in serious situations. If you’re going to get in a fight you better do it with a frown. </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>How would you like to have an argument?  Turns out that learning how to have a good argument might just be the best way to learn to think critically.  In this episode I discuss a neat piece of research in which 7 and 8 year olds are taught how to effectively argue. And they do a darn good job of it as it turns out.  Perhaps this is the way to teach our young people  critical thinking: give them some great books to read - like The Giving Tree - and have them discuss what they think about it.  The key ingredient: making sure that they fully understand the point of view of the other person.  This'll be fun. I promise.  Especially since I've got a couple funny clips from Monty Python's Argument Clinic sketch to help move things along. </p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Borderline Personality Disorder is a difficult disorder to understand and treat.  Briefly, people who suffer from BPD tend to have a heightened sensitivity to rejection.  When they feel that they are being rejected they can react with strong feelings of anger.  Their emotions can be very intense and vary widely during the day.  This can also make their relationships very unstable.  They can also be very impulsive.  However, a recent fascinating piece of research used a mobile device and what's called an "experience sampling" technique to gain further insight into what it is like to have BPD.  In this episode I discuss that research and then wonder what else we might be able to learn as our mobile devices become even more powerful.</p>

In this episode I take a look at a neat new study that involved having singers lie down in an MRI while their brains were scanned. Take a look at how your cerebellum, your parietal lobe your somato-sentory cortex and your amygdala are all involved in your ability to sing.  I'll also look at how mental rehearsal can positively affect how well you perform a task. </p>

Take a look at how your cerebellum, your parietal lobe your somato-sentory cortex and your amygdala are all involved in your ability to sing.  I'll also look at how mental rehearsal can positively affect how well you perform a task.    Kleber, B., Veit, R., Birbaumer, N., Gruzelier, J., &amp; Lotze, M.

			<description><![CDATA[<p>What does the movie Shrek have to do with labeling, psychiatric illness and the self-fulfilling prophecy? In this episode I take a close look at the well-known Rosenhan study.  This was the study in which pseudopatients pretend to hear voices and on the basis of this they get admitted to psychiatric centers.  Then they were told to act normally.  It took an average of 19 days for these pseudopatients to be discharged from the hospital and even then they were diagnosed as schizophrenia in remission. </p>

<p>Does this study show that psychiatric diagnoses are not only useless but also possibly harmful? Or do we find what we found back in episode 47 on Little Albert, and what we found in episode 36 on Kitty Genovese that what we thought we knew is largely wrong.</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[In part 2 of my interview with David Buss, he responds to more criticisms of evolutionary psychology.  Here's what we cover: a) does evolutionary psychology just give criminals another reason not to take responsibility for themselves?,  b) is all the research in evolutionary psychology done on American college students?, c) are evolutionary psychology theories falsifiable? We cover such topics as whether women's mate strategies change depending on where they are in their menstrual cycle? and How does evolutionary psychology might explain homosexuality? and what does evolutionary psychology say about cultural differences in the desire for women with a low waist-hip ratio?  All in this episode of The Psych Files.]]></description>

In this episode of The Psych Files I'll use as an example a very do-able recent study which shows that people tend to overestimage the height of a building when they are on the roof looking down to the ground than when they are on the ground looking up to the roof.  The explanation for this is that evolutionarily, those who overestimated distances looking down were probably more likely to survive - because they probably backed away from the edge and prevented themselves from falling and killing themselves. Both students and faculty might be interested to see how this study could be set up online.</p>]]></description>

In this episode of The Psych Files I explore ideas from Daniel Leviton's fascinating book, Your Brain on Music, especially those ideas concerned with what composers do to draw you into their music by first conforming to your musical expectations and then carefully confounding them in order to surprise and delight. I talk with guitarist and composer David Temple to get his perspective on this process as well.  Along the way you'll hear excerpts from some fascinating pieces of music and David and I will discuss what makes them so compelling, especially those in the minor key.

Even if you are familiar with the Milgram Obedience studies I guarantee you will learn something new in this podcast. I certainly did.

If you are a teacher, a childcare worker, or anyone who works with kids and is frustrated at the fact that for some children time out just doesn't work.  In fact, for some kids time out may actually be a reward because of the popularity it may provide for them from other kids.  If you're worried that time out is not helping, and that the child is headed down a road of developing a personal identity that includes rebel or troublemaker and the end of that road can only be jail, then you need to listen to Dr. Ross Green talk about Collaborative Problem Solving.  We need to treat children different today and this approach holds a lot of insights into that new approach.]]></description>

In this episode I am extremely fortunate to speak with Dr. Eugene Geist, Associate Professor at Ohio University - Athens, Ohio and specialist in early childhood education.  We talk about math anxiety - how it develops and what can be done to help kids overcome it.  So if you have math anxiety, are a parent of a child with math anxiety or are a teacher of math you'll want to hear what Dr. Geist has to say about this topic.  Don't let your kids say "I hate math!" Children are, as Dr. Geist will point out, natural born mathematicians and you can help them with their math homework and in the process help them overcome math anxiety.]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[This past week it seems like people have been talking as much about Elliot Spitzer as they have about his wife Silda. In fact, emotions may be running higher about her behavior than about his.  Why did she stand by and support him when it appears that he clearly betrayed her trust?  Aside from gossip, what's the tie-in to theories in psychology?  Would you believe that the "Covariation Principle" can be applied to this and many similar situations where we are trying to figure out why people do what they do?  Have a listen and learn how we use consensus, consistency and distinctiveness information to make important decisions.]]></description>

Well, this one does and for my 50th episode I'll go over a very interesting study based on the Good Samaritan parable.

<p>After reviewing the study I'll take a look at a couple articles that cite the good samaritan parable and ask the question: what does the results of this study imply about the value of character education, virtues programs, codes of ethics, citizenship and ethical behavior in general?</p>]]></description>

			<description><![CDATA[<p>Classroom management techniques - there are a lot of strategies for dealing with behavior problems in the classroom. It's time to add Collaborative Problem Solving to your toolkit.  Learn an alternative to traditional classroom discipline techniques like timeout or sending the child to the principal.  A recent Time magazine article entitled "How to Make Great Teachers" mentions that in a 2001 survey of teachers, 44% listed "student behavior problems" as the reason they left the profession.  What can be done?</p>

<p>In this episode I interview Dr. Ross Green, author of The Explosive Child and the upcoming book "Lost in School".  He'll tell you how to use collaborative problem solving with your students.
