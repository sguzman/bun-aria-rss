      <title>Episode 113 | SORRY</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>First let’s address the elephant in the room. WE’RE SORRY…we’re so sorry.  The Mixy Boys were out this weekend. First, the guys hit Ludlow House (Julian’s second home) to see the amazing Joyce Wrice. Then Rory ended up in the Bronx and linked with Eddin (in full bear costume). The Yankee’s took the L and so did classic art. Climate Change is real and so is the $10k a student stole from her grandma to give to her classmates. If you’re looking to save money Uber pool is an option to everyone except for Mal. Reading the room is an important life skill, unless you’re Alec Baldwin. Speaking of rooms we’d like to read, Doja Cat went topless at her 27th birthday party. This somehow led to Mal talking about types of showers. GKMC turns 10 and this instant classic spirals to a debate about Drake/Future vs. Drake/21 Savage. In other music news, Taylor Swift is breaking streaming records while Rory shares with us details about a show explaining Spotify’s rise. All can be seated after the Yankees are swept by the (cheating) Astros. In positive NY news, the Giants, Jets and Knicks won their last games. Mal’s Lakers are the second best team in their own city. Listen in as the guys discuss all of this + more!</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>The guys are back after an eventful weekend. Mal treated his mom to the sake squirting bottle at Benihana and Rory went to Dave Chappelle’s midnight show. Meg the Stallion bodied her SNL hosting debut. The White King, Jack Harlow, will make his hosting debut next and we sure hope Rory is invited. Speaking of ongoing beef, Nicki and Lotto continue to trade insults at each other and Kanye chose Drink Champs (again) to take shots at the world. While they continue down a self-destructive path, Meek Mill finds himself befriending everyone again according to his timeline. Pleasing everyone can go too far (or just right) depending on who you’re asking. If you’re asking Congressional Candidate Mike Itkis, he’ll tell you the only logical solution is to upload your video to Pornhub to rally the vote. People keep leveling up the weirdness and our home, NYC, keeps getting dirtier. Rats are everywhere…and not just the subway ones. While rat behavior can lead to someone’s demise it can also lead to a bag. Jordan Poole signs a massive contract following the Draymond punch. LeBron and Bronny have no words for each other in a new Beats commercial and Kanye calls Meek a fed, + more!</p>

      <itunes:summary>The guys are back after an eventful weekend. Mal treated his mom to the sake squirting bottle at Benihana and Rory went to Dave Chappelle’s midnight show. Meg the Stallion bodied her SNL hosting debut. The White King, Jack Harlow, will make his hosting debut next and we sure hope Rory is invited. Speaking of ongoing beef, Nicki and Lotto continue to trade insults at each other and Kanye chose Drink Champs (again) to take shots at the world. While they continue down a self-destructive path, Meek Mill finds himself befriending everyone again according to his timeline. Pleasing everyone can go too far (or just right) depending on who you’re asking. If you’re asking Congressional Candidate Mike Itkis, he’ll tell you the only logical solution is to upload your video to Pornhub to rally the vote. People keep leveling up the weirdness and our home, NYC, keeps getting dirtier. Rats are everywhere…and not just the subway ones. While rat behavior can lead to someone’s demise it can also lead to a bag. Jordan Poole signs a massive contract following the Draymond punch.

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Sha boo yah sha sha sha boo yah…roll call! The guys harmonize their way into today’s audio experience. Over the weekend, Rory was uninvited to the Jack Harlow show leaving room for our lyricist of the year and his side chicks. Speaking of side chicks, accomplished author and professional side chick Brittany Renner expands her brand with a fast-food chain. While her “dating” career continues to flourish, Mal’s might be on the upside because of a new Republican dating app. The DM’s are a dark and dirty place (closes eyes and imagine what Julian showed the guys). In other porn news, Kanye continues to insert himself into more controversy. We discuss the potential of a Karaoke night (patreon?) and why the Dream Team would destroy the Redeem Team, + more!</p>

      <title>Episode 101 | Rory&apos;s Drug Trip Goes Wrong</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>As we head into our hundreds episodes, Rory decided it was time to reflect. So he went on a sound healing journey to get to know himself better... and let's just say he didn't like what he saw. He goes into details about this experience with the team, and they contemplate whether its something they should do as well. Speaking of sound, Ari Lennox's new album came out and the guys give an honest review. Then, as you all have been waiting for, the Irishman delivers the sad, horrible news of Queen Lizzy's passing. Speaking of people who touch sh*t that doesn't belong to them, Mal gets into the news of a BLM (the LLC, not the movement) member skimming a little off the top of the (non)profits, and gives his opinion on that entire organization. Illinois passed their Safe-T law that will release a bunch of alleged criminals, and this leads into a discussion about how each Rory & Mal team member would purge if given the chance. They also discuss upcoming Triller fights, dinner with Bow Wow, how horrible Demaris' California accent impersonation is, their viral sketch, + more!</p><p> </p><p>... & yes the random fourth voice you hear has a name. Its Julian. Yes, 'A Night In New York' guy. </p>

      <title>Episode 55 | &quot;Make Me&quot;</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Starting this week off with the exclusive festival recap, Rory comes in and lets us know how his weekend in North Carolina went. They discuss Dreamville's Gangsta Grillz mixtape, the festival, as well as who is the next one up from that crew. He details his struggle in finding a last minute hotel, and tells his unexpected NC love story. Mal tells us of his weekend in Philly, and the guys discuss how having a show together gives people a hard time separating them as individuals. Discussion then turns to the Grammy Awards, but first they debate whether Lil Nas X is trolling for marketing. They then discuss Grammy nominations and winners, giving well deserved flowers, and giving their differing opinions on some of the winners and categories. Rory hates on everyone who ever met Andre 3000 and Nas, and they reminisce on old, nasty La Marina days from a decade ago. Kanye drops out of Coachella in real time during recording, and the team tries to find a quick replacement. They also discuss taxidermy, give opinions on which artists they believe live their lyrics, hip-hop culture conspiracy theories, + more!</p>

After somehow blaming walk-away videos on Flavor Flav, they give a recap of their weekends, and give the audience a preview of their possible upcoming acceptance speech for The Ambies. Rory takes credit for St. Peters success, Mal gives his opinion on the current women&apos;s sports debate, they both address the craziest narratives they&apos;ve heard about themselves, + more!</itunes:subtitle>

Rory attempts to show the room a dance move literally no one has ever seen before, and then they address the mess that is hip-pop culture right now. They touch on Kanye's Donda 2 performance, Jus Blaze & MF Doom's uncanny voice resemblance, practice their bars for each other in their upcoming rap battle, + more.</p>

      <content:encoded><![CDATA[<p>In this episode, Mal attempts to steer Rory, once again, down a dark and horny path, but luckily we are on the brink of war and were able to pivot to darker news and predictions. They send prayers to Ukraine (and us, to be honest), and try to decide which letter of the alphabet the guy's celebrity falls under. Rory attempts to show the room a dance move literally no one has ever seen before, and then they address the mess that is hip-pop culture right now. They touch on Kanye's Donda 2 performance, Jus Blaze & MF Doom's uncanny voice resemblance, practice their bars for each other in their upcoming rap battle, + more.</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Back after a calm All-Star weekend in, the guys make fun of the rest of the crew for their wild weekend shenanigans. Mal kicks the episode off with a forced apology to Rory for standing him up (there seems to be a theme here), and Rory recaps the Earl Sweatshirt and Action Bronson show that he attended. Karl gives us a preview of his audition to be one of Earl's backup dancers, and then they head into a discussion about the history of All-Star weekends, with Rory & Karl recapping their unfortunate experiences at the one in New Orleans. This leads into a conversation putting MacBooks against Dell computers, and they debate which pre-iphone device was the best. They touch on upcoming episodes of Kanye's doc, and defend former Roc-A-Fella Head of Marketing Chaka Pilgrim from online backlash, and give her flowers. They discuss whether the STEM player is worth the money for what it does, and compare it to the iPod era. They also discuss new music coming (Durk & Kanye), Macy Gray's national anthem performance, Rory's impersonation of the mom from Love & Basketball, + more!</p>

      <title>Episode 31 | &quot;Zoovie&quot;</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>The guys start off debating whether The Carter 3 is a classic or not … no literally, this is the first sentence, so prepare for a music deep dive. Mal insists Wayne has no classic albums, and Rory and Demaris, as always, disagree with him, and ask him to give an example of a classic album to him, and he insists most “classics” are overhyped. This leads into a conversation about The Weeknd’s Dawn FX release, where the guys try to decipher what kind of woman and situation inspired this album (11:44).

They sit down and start to discuss JD’s early journey into hip hop, starting with his breaking of the duo Kriss Kross (16:42). He goes on to explain how he met the late Lisa “LeftEye” Lopes, and how he helped break the group that would become TLC (25:19).

This also activates JD’s urge to get his shit off, who doubles down on his challenge to Puff Daddy for a Verzuz, and explains why he feels underrated (1:24:16). They also touch on other careers JD has broken, their opinion on aging relevance  in Hip-Hop (and basketball), + more!</p>

      <title>Episode 28 | &quot;...And Now We Heal&quot;</title>
      <description><![CDATA[<p>Back in the frigid streets of NYC, Mal & Rory rehash their weekend work trip to Atlanta, and how it felt returning back to their igloo of a hometown. The footage of them learning to fight crime in Detroit has been posted to our YouTube, and they once again reiterate that Dale’s techniques (*might*) actually work. They get into Big Sean’s Drink Champs episode where he responds to Kanye’s previous comments, and wonder how Pusha T is handling the “reconciliation” of Drake & Kanye. This leads into a conversation about friendship, and how women and men handle them differently. Of course, we wouldn’t be us if we didn’t give people relationship advice they didn’t ask for, so we try to help Justine through her breakup with Giveon (somewhat). New music is spoken on, Christmas plans, having a loose caboose, and more!</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Rory & Mal start off recapping their week, including the NRM team holiday dinner, where the executive producer of More Sauce shamelessly admitted to being a serial killer aka sleeping with socks on. They then address the war on Christmas, men getting horrible Christmas gifts, and why we have no recent classic holiday movies. Jussie Smollett was found guilty on his fall report charges for lying his ass off, and that, of course, led to jokes. A bunch of random discussions happen in the middle of this episode - Rory gives advice on the worst places to propose, Mal admits to having a weed dealing hippie fetish, and we finally hear from one of our KanyexYe ticket winners. The guys also discuss new music, Hitman Holla’s close friends + more!</p>

A bunch of random discussions happen in the middle of this episode - Rory gives advice on the worst places to propose, Mal admits to having a weed dealing hippie fetish, and we finally hear from one of our KanyexYe ticket winners. The guys also discuss new music, Hitman Holla’s close friends + more!</itunes:subtitle>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>Back after the Russ episode and a chill weekend, the guys get right to the shits; the shits being the reunion of Drake and Kanye at the Free Larry Hoover benefit concert held in Los Angeles. Rory and Mal give their opinions on the show, the experience of live tweeting it, and speculate how a Kanye & Drake tour would look in 2022. They speak on Travis $cott’s interview about the tragic incident at his festival, and this segues into a thankful Rolling Loud LA recap, as they celebrate a safe completion of the festival, even though LA is in a  self-proclaimed “purge”-adjace state currently. The guys rehash memories of summer camp, and decide to take the New Rory & Mal team on an Adult Summer Camp trip. Mal stresses over the thought of having daughters, and this leads into a conversation about Rory giving up his preference to keep his white bloodline pure, because Gingers are going extinct. They also cover Rick Ross’ new album honestly, speak on more new music that was released + more!</p>

      <description><![CDATA[<p>The boys are back, after a brief Thanksgiving break, and nothing has happened so insert the random shit! They start off getting into defining racism (don't cancel us, please) and discussing how this era of "racy" dress is worse than the Freaknik era. They get into a Thanksgiving recap, which somehow segues into a conversation about the double standards regarding sneaking photos of the opposite sex, and Mal asks the team to explain why a man would twiddle his fiddle while his significant other was in the house. They get into what demographics of men are the craziest exes (more stereotype jokes, again, don't cancel us), which leads to a discussion  about the appropriate house aesthetics to get women excited. In this episode, we also discuss how Rory had a bounty on his nudes, men's Mental Health month, the upcoming trials for Tory & Taxstone, as well as the unfortunate news of Virgil's passing.</p>

Our resident Barb gives his opinion on the vaccine and Nicki Minaj's viral tweets (19:35), and then Karen Civil's scandal gets brought up (31:14), which leads to a conversation regarding &quot;standard&quot; business practices and how they need to change.  Rory explains to Mal what would've been 'The Activist' competition (42:25), while Mal mourns 'The Messiah'. JD has been calling out Diddy in a VERZUZ, and the guys give their thoughts on a possible winner after discussing the recent battle with Fat Joe &amp; Ja Rule (51:28). This wouldn't be a music podcast without discussing new music (1:14:00), just like we wouldn't be Rory &amp; Mal without a random deep dive... this time featuring Crocs (1:19:30), + more!</p>
